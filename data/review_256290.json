But life and the usual stuff kept me from playing it then. On top of that back then it was a ubiconnect exclusive for PC anyway, think it was the game that forced me to make that account. So, so often, I've simply not had that launcher installed and forgot about this game.\r\n\r\nRoll on 10 years, I'm trying to play all the backlog, at least trying them enough to have an opinion (why force myself to finish a game I don't enjoy, currently focusing on Steam just for the shear volume, and my main platform plus having a steam deck sure makes challenging that back log easier, I've even been trying to migrate any games I can to steam, from sales just for convenience in my life. But I didn't want to do that with this game, cause its not a series or a game I play, I only bought it for a connection to an artist I like. But it became the last game on that launcher that I don't have. So I finally played it. Completed it in a couple of days.\r\n\r\nI absolutely love it, 10 years to play but absolute joy to finally do, its fun, its beautiful, it's music is fantastic, the story made me smile at times and yes, cry a bit too,  the way its told and narrated is brilliant and everything is tonally correct, even the 3D model for Aurora in this 2D handpainted world does not stand out at all. It's been so long since a game made me feel this way just playing though it, especially tackling a backlog of what feels like shovelware at times certain from many bundles etc over the years. I had to have this in my steam library, easy play on my deck, role on the winter sale and for a cup of coffee I own the game a second time (at least I played this one!)\r\n\r\nSo far my experience on Steam deck has been great, no issues with saves or launching, it controls fine, looks great still and runs good. I'm not going to deny those launcher issues aren't there, no doubt they are or were at least and might be again depending on what ubisoft decides to do in their infinite (lack of) wisdom. But for now it seems to be a very stable and playable game and one so gorgeous it is worthy of your time.\r\n\r\nIt's so sad there won't be more like it,  Bastion is probably a close one, and I guess most of super giant games count, but not like this light hearted joyful fable that exists.", "timestamp_created": 1735042360, "timestamp_updated": 1735042360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 12053, "total_negative": 1078, "total_reviews": 13131}, "cursors": {"AoJ4y4yBx5ADesbThQU=": "Mon Jan 20 17:17:42 2025"}}
