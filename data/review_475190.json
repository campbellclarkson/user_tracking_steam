La \u00fanica diferencia es que tienes el esc\u00e1ner de puntos mejorado al m\u00e1ximo desde el inicio, lo cual no agrega variedad ni desaf\u00edo.\n\nSobre el g\u00e9nero:\nDebo destacar que este juego est\u00e1 m\u00e1s enfocado en ser una walking simulation que en el terror. Si lo compras esperando sustos o una experiencia aterradora, podr\u00edas sentirte decepcionado. Sin embargo, si buscas algo \u00fanico y diferente, este t\u00edtulo no te defraudar\u00e1.\n\nLa experiencia:\nPasas todo el tiempo en la oscuridad, sin linterna. En su lugar, tienes un esc\u00e1ner de puntos LIDAR para explorar el entorno, lo cual crea una atm\u00f3sfera de claustrofobia, aislamiento y soledad muy bien lograda. Los efectos de sonido son excelentes, y los gr\u00e1ficos, aunque no son de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n, encajan perfectamente con la ambientaci\u00f3n. Este juego demuestra que el arte y el dise\u00f1o creativo son mucho m\u00e1s importantes que los gr\u00e1ficos de alta fidelidad. Es un recordatorio de por qu\u00e9 muchos juegos retro de los 80, 90 y 2000 son atemporales.\n\nComparativa con otros t\u00edtulos:\nEn este momento, hay pocos juegos que ofrezcan una experiencia similar basada en tecnolog\u00eda de escaneo l\u00e1ser. Conozco The Voidness y Sense of Darkness, pero en VR, Scanner Sombre es el rey. La sensaci\u00f3n de estar atrapado y aislado est\u00e1 incre\u00edblemente bien conseguida.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nAunque es corto, ofrece una experiencia memorable. Es una verdadera joya oculta en el cat\u00e1logo de juegos de realidad virtual, y lo recomiendo much\u00edsimo. Si buscas algo \u00fanico, art\u00edstico y envolvente, este juego es para ti.", "timestamp_created": 1736173904, "timestamp_updated": 1736173904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Back then I thought that this was a cool concept game, but that's all it was a game 'concept', an idea, a tech demo.\r\n\r\nNow having gotten round to playing it, well that's pretty much the final product, its a tech demo, an idea, a total concept, one that's looking for well, more of a game to go along with it.\r\n\r\nNothing really bad here TBH. Its a short experience, that seems like it will be a horror game and it tries a few scares from time to time. However as that wasn't the focus they\u2019re few and far between. It's just you, a LiDar scanner as your only means of seeing and a cave system to find your way out of. Most deaths will be falling off a cliff, and that will be mostly due to first person platforming being a forever bad concept.\r\n\r\nOverall it's an experiment of a game that got a release, and introversion even so still didn't quite know what to do with it.\r\n\r\nThumbs up as its worth checking out for the concept, but don't buy at full price. I'm glad I paid less than a pint for it.\r\n\r\n2.5/5\r\n\r\nAlso note: The game comes with the prototype version of this game and a bomb defusing game that never went to full release.", "timestamp_created": 1735329990, "timestamp_updated": 1735329990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50243377685546875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183909237": {"recommendationid": "183909237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156022574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1734750242}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435. 10 \u0438\u0437 10. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e", "timestamp_created": 1735328677, "timestamp_updated": 1735328677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514285683631896973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183903219": {"recommendationid": "183903219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073553690", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1735321655}, "language": "english", "review": "Immersively stunning", "timestamp_created": 1735324456, "timestamp_updated": 1735324456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50243377685546875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183843825": {"recommendationid": "183843825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198860633529", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1735274823}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game! very pretty!!!
