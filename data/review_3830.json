davvero... e diamine cosa mi sono perso.\r\nUn gioco dalla personalit\u00e0 decisamente unica, una trama e i suoi personaggi scritti con un umorismo e un pizzico di satira pungente che gli danno un'anima che di recente ho avuto poche occasioni di vedere, forse persino viste come controverse al giorno d'oggi, in alcuni casi, e tuttavia rimanendo ancora una storia molto matura e profonda che contribuisce a consolidarlo come una perla, secondo me.\r\nAmmetto di non essere abituato ai platform, ne ho giocati pochissimi in vita mia, e forse una piccola critica che posso fare al gioco \u00e8 che alcune delle sezioni sono davvero... strane, sia per colpa della telecamera (un classico), che per alcune cose che secondo me potevano essere fatte meglio, tipo le sezioni platform in cui ci sono i trapezi con il personaggio che non sempre salta bene (e specie nel livello finale in cui \u00e8 stato uno stress totale nell'usarli), e altre cose, come il livello della Levitazione in cui \u00e8 stato particolarmente stressante su alcuni punti, almeno per me.\r\nD'altro canto, di sicuro ci\u00f2 non ha scemato la mia voglia di continuare... anzi, le parti negative vengono comunque inabissate

platform (e tutto sommato anche chi \u00e8 nuovo pu\u00f2 facilmente abituarvisi), sia a chi vuole un'avventura che mescola profondit\u00e0 di tematiche e umorismo smorzante in uno, che lo rendono

The art style, character design, and over all level design felt very unique without fear of changing it up to go along with the games concepts. I personally am a fan of games that have collectibles to obtain and keep track of my progress. Collecting everything is not necessary for completion, but it can be beneficial for leveling up your psi rank to make the game easier.\r\n\r\nThis game did however come with some downsides for this port of the game. I frequently had struggles with collisions in parts of the maps and some unstable controls. I had to put some work in to fully complete this game in spite of it's difficulties in its design, but I am writing this after my completion of everything I found the game had to offer. Withholding spoilers, I did feel the ending still lacked something regarding closure of the defeat of one of the villains. It's not the shiniest jewel, but it is still very pretty to look at and play with.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a nice well rounded experience and enjoy platformer/collectathon games then I cannot recommend it enough for a try. It is a very low commitment game that you could bust out in a short amount of time and still feel satisfied.

Plays okay on Linux - controller compatibility issues meant I had to rebind my controls every time I launched the game.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are super colorful and there is a ton of care put into making each mental world stand out, but a lot of it, characters in particular, is just plain grotesque - other people might be into it, but it's not for me. Similarly, the voice acting ranges from phenomenal (Boyd, G-Men, most of the adult voices) to so bad that I would rather mute the game than hear them speak (Sheegor, young Oleander, some of the other children). Getting to see inside their heads really lets you get to know the characters and sympathize with them, some information given explicitly, but even more implied by the state of their mental world. Each mental world has its own style, rules, and gameplay gimmick; most are good, some are outstanding (Milkman Conspiracy, for example), but the Asylum and Meat Circus SUCK, and as the climax of the game, this happens at the worst possible time. The mental worlds are clearly the focus, but I don't think the overarching story does a great job of tying them all together satisfactorily. Platforming works well enough, if a bit imprecise once levitation gets involved. Combat is okay, mostly just backpedal and shoot for fodder, and trial and error with psychic powers to figure out what each boss is vulnerable to. Not all powers are created equal, and they don't interact with each other much, but each has its uses, at least. No real issues with the soundtrack, but no real standouts, either.\r\n\r\nPsychonauts is uneven, but there's a lot of interesting stuff on display here, and it's at least worth a play, even if I didn't enjoy it enough to go back for 100%.", "timestamp_created": 1736648997, "timestamp_updated": 1736648997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185386810": {"recommendationid": "185386810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049305268", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 837, "last_played": 1724120213}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't believe this game came out 20 years ago, an old gem that still holds up just fine to this day thanks to the cartoon stylized visuals.

I think this is a solid port of a game that I think most people would describe as a cult classic. It's got a familiar build to most early 2000's platformers, but I think that it adds some neat things in how to use the powers your given. I think the one thing that really struck me was how creative and interesting some of the level designs were for the time this game was made. There were some neat ideas executed here that felt a little ahead of their time and probably inspired some games that came after it. \r\n\r\nThere were some parts of this game that I really struggled with though, one of them being the platforming. The controls are so lose and sometimes glitchy that it made progressing through the game way more difficult than what it feels like the developers intended. It also tends to do a poor job of explaining aspects of the game, like how the game never tells you how to access your inventory for the first time. There are also a fair amount of scenes that you can miss just because you do something in the wrong order or you just don't know to be looking for. I gave it a pass on most of these things because I recognize that it's a port of an old game and a lot has changed since this game came out, but i did come close to feeling like it might not be worth it to keep playing to the end at times. \r\n\r\nOverall I think that it's a cool game and it's worth checking out if you either like games from this era or, like me, you've heard a lot about it over the years and want to play it for yourself. It's kind of like a time capsule of a game that gave me a lot of nostalgia for the type of games I remember playing as a kid in the early 2000s.

A little bit before that, not long after I had gotten my PS2, I had stumbled upon the game on an online shop and was intrigued, but I wasn't a big fan of the art style, and a screenshot of the mega censor absolutely disgusted me. I still looked at the game box and flipped it over to look at the back, but put the copy back to where it had been and went away to look at something else.\n\nIf you had told me back then that nearly two decades later this game would become one of my favourite video games of all time and dethrone the PS1 Spyro games for my favourite 3D platformers, I honestly don't know if I'd have believed you, but I still can't help but wonder how differently I'd have turned out had I decided to go through and pick up that quirky looking PS2 game that day despite the things I'd found off-putting about it at the time. The game then didn't cross my mind again until 2011 when an artist I followed on deviantART posted fan art of Raz picking up Lili with telekinesis, and I then kept hearing through the years since just how good the game was, and then its sequel came out and I heard that it was also amazing. I finally picked the game up on sale in 2022, but didn't play it until just recently.\n\nAnd now I keep asking myself:\n\n[h3]Why didn't I play this sooner?[/h3]\n\nThis game is an absolute delight. I decided to play this game on a whim when I had a craving for a 6th gen platformer or something similar. It absolutely gave me what I wanted, but it also gave me so much more.\n\nNot only is Psychonauts a fun platformer that kept me hooked from the beginning to the end, constantly introducing new and fun psychic powers, it's also filled to the brim with details, love, and passion, and hilarious jokes and character interactions. There is so much thought put into everything. What may seem to be a hilarious throwaway joke later turns out to be foreshadowing. And while the art style turned me away from the game all these years ago, I've come to love and embrace it as an adult.\nI love how much weight the collectibles hold and you don't just collect them for the sake of collecting them like in so many other collectathons, but instead one type unlocks lore, and all collectibles will contribute to your rank, which in turn enhances your psychic abilities. The levels aren't just fun to play through but they're also really creative, I was always excited to see what was next. Even Gloria's theater, with its slower pacing and sometimes frustrating puzzle solving, was a delight to play through. Also, I can't talk about how much I love this game and why without bringing up Raz himself. What an amazing little menace, he's become one of my favourite video game protags of all time.\n\nWith all of that said, this game isn't perfect, but there's very little in it that detracts from the overall enjoyment for me. Psychonauts is a 6th gen game down to its controls, they felt a little janky and unrefined at first, but since I played 6th gen platformers as a kid (and replayed a few of them last year) I got used to them fairly quickly, but if you've not played many 6th gen platformers and didn't grow up with them you may have a more difficult time adapting to them. The writing is also dated in some aspects, with its depiction of some mental issues being particularly cartoonish (though it's also important to stress this is a mid 2000s game and our understanding of mental health has improved significantly since). \nThen there's the infamous final level in which the difficulty spikes up to the extreme. Also, some of the figments can be really difficult to find, and the game has a point of no return and some missable collectibles which can make 100%ing it painful. (I wanted to 100% the game on my first playthrough but decided I'd leave it for a future playthrough.)\n\nHowever, despite all of this, I still absolutely adored the game. It's very clearly a labour of love and I love it so much. And while the writing may be dated in some aspects since it's a mid 2000s game, it still approaches mental issues with as much respect and nuance as it possibly can. \n\nIf you wanna know just how much I love this game and how hooked I was on it I played the final level and beat the final boss while dealing with a particularly nasty headache. \n\nHeadsup but this version of the game is slightly janky. While the game never crashed for me (played on W10) and had no problem with my Xinput controller (8Bitdo Ultimate 2C wired) there are points where you have to use the mouse to navigate through menus which can feel cumbersome. The biggest issues I had with the game were frame stutters and occasional audio glitches.\n", "timestamp_created": 1736555637, "timestamp_updated": 1736555637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185292688": {"recommendationid": "185292688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840462601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2145, "playtime_at_review": 1945, "last_played": 1736609143}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I ever played.

Ver este nombre era un sello de calidad de cada juego. Es exactamente en esta empresa donde comienza a escribirse la historia de Tim Schafer. Este tipo particip\u00f3 en la creaci\u00f3n de Maniac Mansion y luego fue co-escritor y programador de The Secret of Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck 's Revenge y Day of the Tentacle. Era claro que Tim la ten\u00eda larga, entonces es cuando lidera dos joyas del mundo gaming: Full Throttle (1995) y Grim Fandango (1998). En el 2000 es cuando decide irse y fundar Double Fine Productions y tras cinco a\u00f1os de trabajo [b]Psychonauts[/b] ve la luz y Tim nos muestra que adem\u00e1s de tenerla larga, tambi\u00e9n la usa de bufanda.\n\n[b]Psychonauts[/b] es un juego de aventuras y plataformas publicado en 2005. Hay quienes lo supieron jugar en la PS2, Xbox y algunos en Windows XP, pero afortunadamente hoy lo podemos volver a jugar en sistemas actuales de principio a fin. El juego alardea de un dise\u00f1o \u00fanico y excelente apartado gr\u00e1fico (para la \u00e9poca). Pese a todo no ha envejecido del todo mal y no da\u00f1a la vista. Sus escenarios son diversos y en ocasiones hace uso inteligente de las perspectivas. Suben el list\u00f3n cuando entra la banda sonora en escena. La musicalizaci\u00f3n es digna del cine y genera la ambientaci\u00f3n adecuada para cada momento. \n\nEl gameplay es adecuado. Puede que este sea su punto m\u00e1s flojo, pero no por eso imposible de jugar. Usar gamepad es m\u00e1s que recomendado y el personaje responde muy bien. Puede que algunas mec\u00e1nicas de juego hayan envejecido un poco mal, pero no interrumpe para nada su jugabilidad. Los niveles de plataformas son interesantes aunque algunas veces pueden generar algo de frustraci\u00f3n. La dificultad es completamente acertada y no tiene picos artificiales.\n\nLo verdaderamente interesante es su argumento. Sos un ni\u00f1o llamado Razputin que desea ser un psiconauta. Para eso te introduc\u00eds en un campamento de ni\u00f1os en formaci\u00f3n pero r\u00e1pidamente comprend\u00e9s que algo anda mal. Desde ah\u00ed comenz\u00e1s a usar tus crecientes habilidades ps\u00edquicas para introducirte en la mente de las personas y resolver los distintos problemas hasta llegar al n\u00facleo de ello. Asimismo, tambi\u00e9n vas revelando tus miedos ocultos.\n\n[b]Psychonauts[/b] es uno de esos juegos donde una vez comenzados no se puede dejar de jugar. Es cierto que su inicio es m\u00e1s bien \u00e1spero, pero puede desarrollar todo su potencial pasadas las primeras horas. Tiene muchos coleccionables por lo que su duraci\u00f3n total puede exceder c\u00f3modamente las 15 horas de juego. Es com\u00fan encontrarlo en descuento aunque incluso a precio completo sigue siendo una buena compra. Muy recomendado antes de jugar su segunda parte.", "timestamp_created": 1736094112, "timestamp_updated": 1736094112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577276527881622314", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184846687": {"recommendationid": "184846687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870120496", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1736108335}, "language": "english", "review": "SUPER RECOMENDO!!

However, if you happen to read this and aren't that bothered by my complains, be sure to check it out because the game is undoubtedly good.\n\nSo my main gripe with it is that the game shows its age, but not for the reasons you might expect (in fact I couldn't care less about the graphics); instead, it feels outdated for four main reasons:\n[olist] [*]It has compatibility issues with W10 and higher. Thankfully it can be easily solved, so to avoid constant crashes after certain dialogues, set compatibility mode to something like Vista or earlier.\n\n[*]The controller support doesn\u2019t work fully. It took some time to function and recognize Steam Input during the first few game sessions, and there are certain settings that can only be adjusted using a mouse.\n\n[*]It doesn\u2019t come with subtitles in Spanish, which isn\u2019t a personal barrier for me but is worth noting.\n\n[*]But my greater issue with the title is that mission design also feels outdated. Setting aside the technical aspects and delving into the gameplay, I don\u2019t intend to dissect every single detail, but I\u2019ll focus particularly on three: kinesthesia, pacing and difficulty scaling.\n[/olist] [list]\n\n[*]Regarding the player's movement, jumping, shooting, grabbing stuff... It doesn\u2019t particularly work like a charm... obviously! Still worth mentioning though, because I\u2019m not gonna lie, there are certain parts of the game where I was mad at how clunky the controls and camera can get. Same goes for certain platforming zones, where my boy Raz took forever to grab the proper pipeline. It\u2019s aged.\n\n[*]The pacing, being more subjective, genuinely bothers me due to the mission structure\u2014you spend half the game in a tutorial phase, and the rest is what truly feels like the actual game, although I have personal grievances with the design of certain levels: I find it unacceptable that some main missions are gated behind a required level. The grinding isn\u2019t overly tedious but could've been avoided by designing a more organic structure.\n\n[*]As for difficulty, the game is fundamentally too easy in almost all of its parts, except for around the last third. Additionally, some of these later puzzles (starting as early as the infamous Milkman mission) provide very few hints on how to solve them, so I had to check a guide. Btw, the last mission is too demanding, especially considering that throughout the game you are almost never expected to be that skilled.\n\n[/list]\n\nAs I said previously, the game is a must, so I'm editing this review and recommending it, but in order to fully enjoy the experience, you must be aware of its flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1735697005, "timestamp_updated": 1735908651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184375028": {"recommendationid": "184375028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369827519", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1117, "last_played": 1632861074}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful and very creative game.", "timestamp_created": 1735686416, "timestamp_updated": 1735686416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184364690": {"recommendationid": "184364690", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037481867", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 629, "last_played": 1735935056}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "delicia cara", "timestamp_created": 1735677566, "timestamp_updated": 1735677566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184309773": {"recommendationid": "184309773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817498078", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2727, "last_played": 1735635252}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the game after a year of playing it on and off.
