And there's this group of people having what seems like the most riveting conversation of their lives. You want to join in, but you're walking across the room slower than my nan after her hip replacement. That's Oxenfree for you - brilliant chat, painful walking.\n\nNow, before you roll your eyes and mutter \"walking simulator\" under your breath like some gaming snob, let me tell you something. This game's about as much a walking simulator as I am a flight instructor. It's all about the chat, innit?\n\nThe dialogue system's bloody brilliant, actually. You know when you're at the pub and everyone's talking over each other, and you've got that split-second decision to either interrupt like a proper bellend or wait politely and miss your chance? That's exactly what they've captured here. Three dialogue options floating above your head like thought bubbles in a comic strip, plus the option to shut up entirely - which, let's be honest, more people should consider in real life.\n\nThe writing's proper authentic too. None of that \"How do you do, fellow kids?\" nonsense you get in most games. These teens talk like actual teenagers - stumbling over words, talking absolute rubbish half the time, leaving sentences hanging like my mate Johan's DIY shelving project. It's refreshing, like finding a cold beer in the back of your fridge when you thought you'd run out.\n\nThe atmosphere's spot on as well. They're calling it horror, but that's like calling a mild curry spicy. It's more like that feeling you get when you're alone in your house at night and hear a weird noise - not scary exactly, just enough to make you question your life choices.\n\nNow, there are some problems. The walking speed's slower than the queue at the post office on pension day. And sometimes you have to backtrack across the island with nothing but your thoughts for company - which, if they're anything like mine, isn't ideal.\n\nIt's a short game too, and while your choices do matter somewhat, don't expect dramatically different endings like you're directing your own Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nBut here's the thing - and I know this might sound odd coming from someone who made their career taking the piss out of everything - Oxenfree is actually pretty special. It's like that friend who doesn't say much at parties but when they do speak, everyone shuts up and listens. Sure, it might not be the longest game in your library, but neither was Pong, and that did alright for itself, didn't it?\n\nSo, should you buy it? Well, if you've got the attention span of a goldfish with ADHD and need constant explosions to stay entertained, probably not. But if you fancy something different, something that'll make you think and might actually surprise you - like finding out your cat's been secretly ordering takeaway on your credit card - then yeah, give it a go.

This is essentially a visual novel, so your participation in the game is limited.

The voice acting is first-rate, and this has some characters that really seem like flesh-and-blood humans.  The major downside is the time it takes to walk around the island to reach the story destinations (things can get tedious, especially if you're not sure where to go next).
