an insult to the series. It is creatively bankrupt drivel: mediocre story, mediocre levels, mediocre lore. For whatever it's worth, this game is not glitchy and broken; Sega made two of the most infamously glitchy broken video games eight years apart and certainly did not want to repeat that and I supposed they technically succeeded with that. To an extent though, I genuinely believe that even the glitchy broken mess of a game that is Sonic '06 has more value than this, because even if it was ruined back then by Sega's horrifically rushed development time, it still feels like a game that was actually trying big and failing hard. For them to have released this back then almost literally alongside Sonic Mania was  genuinely hilarious. The literal Team Sonic's big new game was a very wide 2nd place in their own franchise to what was basically a glorified fan game. \n\nThe modern sonic stages make the boost feel like just a win button, the classic sonic handling and stage design feel abhorrent and do nothing to actually justify his inclusion other than tying this to a vastly superior video game that is literally amazing at both, and while the concept of the avatar stuff is cute and entertaining, the game and its levels do not feel anywhere near interesting or entertaining enough to make them feel worth it.\n\nPlaying this back in 2017 (on console) was awful, and trying to play it again now is awful. There are WAY better Sonic games on this platform, especially now. Sega/Team Sonic feel like they've gotten their s*** together the past few years with Frontiers and Shadow Generations as well as the side games. Between the game quality, the comics, and heck the movie franchise, the 2020's really feel like a genuine renaissance for the franchise and I am very happy to see it. Hopefully that trend continues into the future.\n\nHere's a list of every sonic game on steam that would objectively be more worth your time than this:\n\n3D Games: Frontiers, Sonic x Shadow Generations, Adventure, Adventure 2, Colors \n\n2D Games: Mania, Origins Plus (1, 2, CD, 3&K), Superstars\n\nSide Games: The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, any of the racing games\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1737048630, "timestamp_updated": 1737048630, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185692013": {"recommendationid": "185692013", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175732197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1737051272}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a awesome game play it", "timestamp_created": 1737005808, "timestamp_updated": 1737005808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185688588": {"recommendationid": "185688588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390392611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 377, "playtime_at_review": 1780, "deck_playtime_at_review": 1780, "last_played": 1736999855}, "language": "english", "review": "Sonic Forces is probably one of the worst (if not THE worst) Sonic experiences I've ever had the displeasure of playing, having 100%'d the game i can say with full confidence that this game and its sheer laziness are not worth the effort\r\n\r\nBut hey the Overclocked mod was pretty damn fun and that alone is worth it in my opinion", "timestamp_created": 1737000176, "timestamp_updated": 1737000176, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "185678194": {"recommendationid": "185678194", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000740478", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1291, "playtime_at_review": 1291, "last_played": 1736974142}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Sonic Forces me to write a negative review[/h1]\r\nReleased as part of the series' 25th Anniversary, this is among one of the weakest mainline entries in the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nThere are three playable characters to play as, starting with Modern Sonic who is nowhere near as fun to play as compared to previous and future games. Everything that made the other boost games enjoyable to play is nowhere to be found here and even feels a bit slower. The Avatar was a pretty cool concept, but very lacking in execution. You unlock extra custom parts from completing missions and those can be used to dress up your avatar however you want. I barely feel like I'm the main hero of the story, however, given that you spend most of the game playing as the other characters instead of your avatar.\r\n\r\nReturning from Colours and Lost World are wisps, which were a fun addition to those games as they were used to explore levels in different ways providing unique experiences on repeat plays. You will find none of that here. Each avatar gets a wispon to equip, but you can only carry one at a time. Only wisps that match the currently used wispon can be picked up and used mid-level which severely limits their potential. Burst does the job in every situation, with zero incentive to try anything else.\r\n\r\nWispons provide some of the most dull and shallow combat I've ever experienced in a 3D platformer. Each wispon attacks in different ways, but the only good one is Burst as it has good range and keeps you on the move. The others are all terrible as they are either awkward to handle like Cube, or stop you when using them like Lightning. Enemies stand no chance - all foes are defeated in one hit in the exact same way so experimenting with different wispons is pointless.\r\n\r\nBoth of the other characters are still way more fun to play as compared to Classic Sonic, who is bar none the worst part of the entire game. Movement is very stiff making it hard to enjoy even the most basic of platforming. Physics and momentum barely work - I can't run down massive slopes and gain massive speeds to gain massive air from the ramp at the bottom when this was effortless to do back in 1992, for example. The only positive with Classic Sonic is that the drop dash from Mania is present.\r\n\r\nControl is really jank. Acceleration feels off in ways the other games don't, and platforming in 2D feels quite stiff compared to the other 2D games that felt far more responsive. That's just Modern Sonic - as the Avatar, there were times where you suddenly speed up for no reason which has resulted in missed jumps, and pressing the opposite direction mid-jump carries all forward momentum whereas letting go of the direction has you stop completely, which really throws me off as Classic Sonic is the exact opposite of this.\r\n\r\nFor all of you level designers out there, use this game as an example of what to avoid. Most levels can be summed up as boost to win where all you do is hold down a button and watch as Sonic speeds through everything in his path. No fast reactions, no reward for sticking to the fastest routes and barely any exploration. Levels are forgettable as almost all of them play the same with only 2 exceptions, those being Egg Gate for being the only showcase of branching paths done right in this entire game, and Network Terminal which utilises spinning platforms and pink water in a very creative way not found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMortar Canyon, the only fully 3D level, outright punishes you for trying to play the game. There's several branching paths that all lead to nothing, most of the stage can be cleared by simple homing attack chains or boosting over everything, and in the middle of the stage there's a ramp that takes you over the more difficult slower paths rewarding you with a red ring for doing so.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3404910447\r\nLevels do not escalate in difficulty once - the final level is just as easy to finish as the first one. There are difficulty settings, but they barely do anything. All that Hard Mode does is make you lose all your rings when you get hit - level design is not altered based on the difficulty chosen, and all my deaths were from one hit deaths anyway making this setting useless.\r\n\r\nLevels average 1.5 minutes in length which is far too short for a Sonic game, and the main story can be beaten in around 3 hours making this a very short game, but it felt much longer than that due to how bland the experience was. S ranks feel more like participation trophies due to how easy they are to obtain, limiting replayability. Any cool moments are entirely automated, as is turning on corners.\r\n\r\nThis game does not look good for a 2017 game. Environments look bland and do not invoke the imagination in any way; all you get is just Green Hill, Chemical Plant and Metropolis the entire time. Characters feel like lifeless vessels due to lacking idle animations that every other game in the series had, and barely express themselves during cutscenes or gameplay. Explosions look terrible like they came from the N64. Sonic Unleashed, a PS3 game from 2008, looks leaps and bounds better than this game does even on the highest graphics settings available. Performance is consistent at 60FPS with minimal loading times, but that alone isn't impressive.\r\n\r\nI can't even speak positively about the story. Much like all the games in the 2010's, this was written by people that knew nothing about this franchise and it shows due to the amount of inconsistencies and continuity errors present in the plot. Tails had all his character development ruined by cowering in fear in front of Chaos 0 when he fought Chaos 4 in the past.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3403545205\r\nClassic Sonic is now from another dimension (Mania) even though Classic Sonic from Generations was his younger self.\r\n\r\nSeveral plot elements are introduced and immediately discarded like they're nothing. Null Space had potential for a cool level, but it's nothing more than a Double Boost QTE that's over in 5 seconds. Unlike previous games which show you what happens in the story thus adding immersion, most cutscenes in this game just tell you everything that happens instead making it feel less immersive than even the Mega Drive games that told compelling narratives with zero dialogue. For example, Eggman takes over the world via a black screen with text.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3403544513\r\nTo further showcase a lack of care when it comes to world building, the main city in this game is just called \"City\" - they didn't even bother giving it a name.\r\n\r\nFor achievement hunters, this game is very tedious to 100% with zero respect for your time. There are missions that require you to defeat a certain amount of enemies with a certain action, only to unlock another mission where you do the same thing again but with 2 more enemies to defeat; you still have to do it again even if you met the requirements the first time. There are achievements for gathering 100,000 rings which is very time consuming. Each level also has 5 numbered rings and moon rings, but can only be collected [i]after[/i] finding all the red rings in a level making it pointless filler and they don't unlock anything outside of achievements.\r\n\r\nIn short, there's basically nothing this game has to offer in the current year. Don't buy Sonic Forces - don't even get it on discount. If boost gameplay is what you're looking for, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Colours and Unleashed do it way better.

Sonic and the Avatar had enough 2d sections.\nThe game had quite a bit of hallway/tunnel gameplay like Sonic Dash and Sonic Forces: Speed Battle. Just a bit too much.\nStory and stages felt all over the place. Hoping back n forth. In the end, didn't feel like a lot of variety. Like 5 or 6 stages and varieties of them drawn out into 30 missions using the different characters.\n\nThe avatar customization and avatar character was a huge highlight. Wish they did more with it and the avatar gameplay. More wispon usage. Taken some inspiration from Ratchet & Clank. Let us swap wispon on the fly mid level.\nAt it's core, the story was good, just could've been presented better. Infinite is great in design and voiced well.\nDoes look like there's quite a bit of replayability with red rings, ranks, and missions for avatar clothing. Not really too excited about going for 100%. Some of the platforming sections were annoying, but not crazy difficult. Just take lots of time and patience. Red rings are fairly obviously placed, just easy to miss. Hard to or impossible to backtrack to them in most stages too.\n\nGraphics overall were good. Some of the characters felt awkward idling in the background though like vr clones.

Como novato en juegos de Sonic, encontr\u00e9 que Forces logr\u00f3 captar mi inter\u00e9s desde el principio. Lo que m\u00e1s me atrajo fue la velocidad fren\u00e9tica y la acci\u00f3n constante que ofrece el juego. La capacidad de alternar entre Sonic cl\u00e1sico y moderno, junto con la introducci\u00f3n de un nuevo personaje personalizable, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 variedad y frescura a la experiencia.\r\n\r\nUna de las cosas que realmente disfrut\u00e9 fue la narrativa. Aunque simple, logr\u00f3 mantenerme interesado en la historia y en los personajes. La idea de unirse con personajes ic\u00f3nicos como Tails y Knuckles para derrotar al malvado Dr. Eggman y su nuevo aliado, Infinite, me mantuvo motivado para avanzar.\r\n\r\nGr\u00e1ficamente, el juego es colorido y vibrante, con mundos bien dise\u00f1ados que capturan la esencia de los juegos de Sonic. La m\u00fasica tambi\u00e9n fue un punto destacado para m\u00ed; las pistas son pegajosas y encajan perfectamente con la acci\u00f3n y el ambiente del juego.\r\n\r\nSin embargo, como jugador nuevo en la saga, not\u00e9 algunas cr\u00edticas que podr\u00edan no molestar a los fan\u00e1ticos de toda la vida, pero que me pareci\u00f3 importante mencionar. Por ejemplo, la duraci\u00f3n del juego podr\u00eda haber sido un poco m\u00e1s larga, y algunas secciones se sintieron un poco repetitivas. Adem\u00e1s, hubo momentos en los que la c\u00e1mara no cooperaba del todo bien, lo que ocasionalmente afect\u00f3 mi experiencia de juego.\r\n\r\nEn resumen, Sonic Forces me hizo fan de la saga Sonic y me inspir\u00f3 a jugar los juegos cl\u00e1sicos.

I loved it when it came out, I was a child then. I'm no longer a child anymore.\n\nsix - nearly seven years later, I cant begin to tell you how much this game is the definition of mediocre. From the awful story, to the awful game play, there's a lot to rip into.\n\nFirst off the story is genuinely awful as I said. If you're name isn't sonic or \"Rookie\", you are stuck to the sidelines with nothing to do. Tails in this game was the worst offender. \nThe game play is even worse. The levels in this game feel lazy and uninspired. They feel like you are running in a straight line all the way through. Barely any branching paths and the few that exist are so obvious its genuinely funny. The characters you play as are garbage too. Classic Sonic controls like a brick and for some parts YOU WILL LOSE MOMENTUM WHEN IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO DO SO. Hes genuinely the worst of the three. Modern sonic is not any better. Many of his moves from earlier games are gone including drifting. Making him feel more stripped back and bare bones from those previous games. \n\nLast one is the Rookie. He feels like an even more stripped back version of the sonic in this game. They try some new things like the Wispon and the grapple. The Wispon is implemented....fine, but definitely nothing new. The grapple is mostly either in place of a homing attack or just for set pieces, its also nothing special. The only thing I would say was great about the avatar was the customization. \n\nIn fact that's all this game has that's really good. You just have to actually play the game to unlock the options in order to customize the character, and that is not fun. \n\noverall this game was a complete step in the wrong direction for Sega and they did not do this game any favors. If you REALLY want to pick this game up for whatever reason, wait for it to go on sale. Otherwise I would not recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1735524351, "timestamp_updated": 1735524544, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":
