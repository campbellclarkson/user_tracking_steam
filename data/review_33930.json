I play without any mods. I'll update this review if I spend more time in A2.\n\nIf Bohemia Interactive (BI) doesn't support its old games anymore, then it should make them completely free-to-play (and it should include all the downloadable content for free).\n\nA2 is an improvement over Arma: Gold Edition, but it has many problems, errors, and limitations to be a \"hardcore and realistic war simulator\".\n\nSome examples (let me know if there are earlier 3D games with these features):\n\nAction Quake 2 (1998) has the SIG Sauer SSG 3000 rifle with reloading animations (including the moving bolt).\n\nCall of Duty: United Offensive (2004) lets you mount machine guns not only while being prone almost anywhere, but also in specific areas of maps while standing or crouching, and while riding vehicles.\n\nDelta Force (1998) lets you fire weapons that have backblast while being prone (it's possible in reality as long as nothing is behind the weapon; neither DF1, nor A2 have damage from backblast), and has dual rendering for telescopic sights (and Comanche: Maximum Overkill (1992) has dual rendering as the Target Acquisition System camera display/target display).\n\nDelta Force 2 (1999) has wind (which is only decorative in A2) that affects trajectory of bullets, and has telescopic sights that can be adjusted for range (magnification doesn't reset). Delta Force: Black Hawk Down (2003) also lets you adjust the mechanical sight of the M203 grenade launcher for range (very enjoyable to shoot). But not all sights that can be adjusted for range in reality can be adjusted in A2. Sights can't be adjusted for windage in A2.\n\nGoldenEye 007 (1997) lets you dual wield weapons and \"cook\" grenades (in reality, it's done by removing the pin and releasing the lever while still holding the grenade in your hand for a second or less).\n\nHard Drivin' (1989) has a working clutch pedal.\n\nMafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002) lets you enter or exit a vehicle by opening or closing its door, take almost any seat near a window, turn out, and shoot almost all guns.\n\nThe Need for Speed (1994) has a working handbrake.\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear (1999) has usable gun safeties.\n\nWinBack (1999) has an additional cartridge in the chamber (only the Benelli M1014 has this feature in A2).\n\nWinning Run (1988) has working mirrors and a manual transmission.\n\nYet this \"simulator\" doesn't have any (except the cartridge in the chamber) of these features above.\n\nYou can kill enemy medics (even unarmed ones and regardless of their actions) and destroy ambulances (regardless of their actions) and hospitals without any penalties. Enemy computer players (bots) can do the same.\n\nReloading animations are very outdated. Slides of pistols now move and lock to the rear, however, the Navy SEALs mod (1997) for Quake was one of the earliest games with fully animated, reloadable weapons (and moving slides), and James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire (2001) was one of the earliest games with non-empty (tactical) reloading animations.\n\nYou can't kill two enemies with one bullet from the Barrett M107 rifle.\n\nNo co-pilots.\n\nNo hand-to-hand combat.\n\nNo anti-personnel mines, booby traps, melee weapons, stun grenades, and incendiary/thermobaric weapons/ammunition.\n\nYou can't shoot or throw grenades while running.\n\nYou can't jump.\n\nMisaligned sights.\n\nYou can't interact with bots by using a microphone.\n\nThe M1014 shotgun reloads unrealistically fast (8 cartridges in around 3 seconds). Weapons should have performance and sounds like in reality.\n\nReloadable RPG-18s, and M18 grenades with blue and orange smoke colors aren't realistic. The Glock 17 doesn't accept Beretta 92 magazines in reality.\n\nNo RDG-2B smoke grenades for the OpFor.\n\nOnly M1A2 Abrams tanks have loaders (however, they only use machine guns). Loader players could have pressed buttons or played a reloading mini-game (similar to that in World of Shooting (2024)) to operate guns.\n\nFemale civilians can't pick up and use weapons, sit, go prone, walk while crouching, and drive many vehicles regardless of their in-game skill level, even though various armed groups around the world have always had female fighters in reality (I know that men are better fighters because of biology).\n\nThe slowest 2004 \u0160koda Octavia 1.4 has a top speed of 170 km/h in reality, but it has a top speed of 101 km/h in A2 (it can't go any faster). Gameplay balance doesn't belong in hardcore and realistic simulators at all.\n\nCrashing the HDT M1030M1 JP8 motorcycle into a hard obstacle at 85 km/h will only result in a damaged wheel, other minor damages, and minor injuries (the \"extended armor\" is disabled).\n\nSome vehicles have unusable seats.\n\nUnlike planes and helicopters, land vehicles in A2 are very easy to control like in a casual driving game.\n\nMore problems:\nNo official in-depth guide that explains everything about A2.\n\nBattlEye is controversial. The best anticheat is a competent administrator of a user-created dedicated (or LAN) server.\n\nQuantity over quality.\n\nVery few people still play the multiplayer mode. BI can make the multiplayer mode much more populated by creating official servers and gifting various content (games, DLCs, etc.) to players who play on these servers.\n\nDLCs have installation problems (now everything is installed on my PC) and inconsistency. For some reason, the Arma X collection, British Armed Forces and Private Military Company DLCs are listed as separate games in my Steam library, but the Army of the Czech Republic DLC isn't.\n\nPerformance issues. Frame rates drop even on very low settings. Many players also report other technical problems.\n\nRed flashes during the \"You died\" screen are annoying.\n\nNo content from previous games.\n\nNot vegan friendly.\n\nBI should have used system requirements of premium PCs of 2009 instead of common PCs during the development of A2.\nhttps://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/222003039/the-top-10-pc-components-of-2010\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-roundup,2297.html\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/33900/Arma_2]A2's page.[/url] Scroll down to system requirements.\n\nIt's better for people to make their own free games, software, websites, and guides.
