I got into this game towards the end of last year, and it consumed my life for a few months.\n\nPerformance-wise, it plays at a solid 60 FPS (at only around 9-11W of power!) on the Steam Deck with out of the box settings.\n\nDo note that after a while, or if you complete dungeons too fast, you'll start getting recaptchas after 1-2 rooms. It was somewhat bearable when I first started playing, but as I got hooked and played more and more frequently, I ended up switching to a Windows PC to play more heavily.\n\nArtwork and animations are absolutely beautiful for a 2D/2.5D game like this, and is one of the reasons I picked it up in the first place.\n\nMSQ, though a little cheesy, was pretty enjoyable. There's also neat little class-specific dialogue options that come up from time to time, depending on what you're playing as.\n\nI managed to get all the way to the Total War raids with my Inquisitor, Skirmisher, Impaler and Vagabond chars, and began to really ramp up fame growth, without feeling any pressure to pay for any premium MTX.\n\nHowever, after dipping my toe into the \"premium\" / MTX side of things, my experience with Neople after an incident with my first (and unfortunately last) purchase soured my enjoyment to the point where I stopped playing altogether.\n\nTowards the end of January 2024 I purchased an item from their premium shop called the \"Gold Safe Upgrade Kit\", that was advertised to increase account-bound storage. After purchasing and redeeming this ingame, I found out that it instead upgraded character-bound storage instead.\n\nI reached out to Neople support pointing out the mistake in their online store description and to see what could be done to either refund or remove this item for the character that I redeemed it with, as if I knew ahead of time this was a character-bound expansion item, I'd have picked a different character.\n\nNeople's response was to tell me to pretty much go kick rocks, and seemingly had zero intention to change the description of the advertised product.\n\nThis, in addition to the fairly regular reports of players getting randomly banned from their overzealous antibotting/anticheat detection system (which often and seemingly randomly trade bans players), killed any motivation I had to keep playing, as Neople support does not treat its global playerbase well at all.\n\nAs of this review (12/30/2024), I still see that the \"Gold Safe Upgrade Kit\" description on their website (https://webstore.dfoneople.com/View/Consumables/Detail.aspx?ItemID=1050) has not changed one bit, with the falsely advertised descriptions \"More space for your account Safe!\" and \"The Gold Safe Upgrade Kit extends your account slots by 72.\"\n\nI see little reason to ever consider spending any meaningful amount of time or money into a game like this, and actively discourage others from doing the same.", "timestamp_created": 1735601288, "timestamp_updated": 1735601288, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577186286449432373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184218096": {"recommendationid": "184218096", "author": {"steamid": "76561199295400545", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1658479239}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed", "timestamp_created": 1735564975, "timestamp_updated": 1735564975, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184149799": {"recommendationid": "184149799", "author": {"steamid": "76561199189618082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1735736274}, "language": "english", "review": "such a nice game for chill out with your self but remember the lvl design had some problem but that's good\r\nand the other problem is your character. you can one shot all enemy in early game and there is no chalange", "timestamp_created": 1735503738, "timestamp_updated": 1735503738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184083328": {"recommendationid": "184083328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045944616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12424, "last_played": 1727778372}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "B\u00e3o.", "timestamp_created": 1735467054, "timestamp_updated": 1735467054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184082264": {"recommendationid": "184082264", "author": {"steamid": "76561199683504340", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1735871367}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Immersive combat, nostalgic graphics; outshines others in genre!\"", "timestamp_created": 1735466091, "timestamp_updated": 1735466091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184012313": {"recommendationid": "184012313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315107288", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1475, "last_played": 1734704337}, "language": "english", "review": "Fool's Game, is already dead in all regions, someone who is older and pretty boring would play it for too long, endlessly Top up and incessant new versions.
