If you have phones with internet connection, connecting to the Jackbox website and the players can watch your screen with the game on it, you are already ready to play. The game looks and plays quite simply and it is fun to play with others. In my opinion Fibbage XL is probably one of the few games which anyone can enjoy. There are quite a lot of facts in this one, which can be exhausted if you only pick unique topics in 6-7 hours, which might not sounds too much, but that's quite a lot of games to play.\n\nHowever, as every Jackbox game you need to have a phone to play this on, that\u2019s unavoidable. Also since this is a couch game you have to find others to play with you as there is no lobby mode in this game, but thankfully with the ability of screen sharing it\u2019s not impossible to play with friends online.\n\nThese negative aspects are true to every Jackbox game, so this is not just Fibbage exclusive problems. Fibbage is one of the oldest Jackbox games, but in my opinion it\u2019s one of the best to pick, and I can definitely recommend buying the Fibbage solo version, if you are not interested in getting the Jackbox Party Pack 1. 6\u20ac seems a bit expensive for it, try to get it around 4 and you won\u2019t get disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1735596919, "timestamp_updated": 1735596919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614831507205963135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 294, "total_negative": 17, "total_reviews": 311}, "cursors": {"AoJ4uLOcpe8CdKnQ5wE=": "Mon Jan 20 19:08:09 2025"}}
