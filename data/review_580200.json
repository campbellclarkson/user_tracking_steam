There really is not much past the game mechanics and no reason to really continue engaging with them if you already have 30 stacks of everything and are just standing around or walking in circles waiting for the spawn of a specific thing. \n\nIn these periods, the only thing you really can do is go fishing and then trade fish for old coins or just dismiss a farm hand and stand around collecting poop or whatever.  or collect mystery seeds, make a tree farm, farm for the tree seeds and try to make each biome have its biome specific tree.
