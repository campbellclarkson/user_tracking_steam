This is my favorite. The graphics are outdated, the dino ai is kinda wonky and the vehicles are hard to control. I LOVE this game. \nDo I recommend this? Yes. Why? its $0.99. If you have fun for like...5 minutes, it's worth it. I have purchased this for anyone in my family or friends who even consider playing. \n\nI have one request, I realize this doesn't make much sense, but if I had one single wish, it would be to allow offline LAN multiplayer. That would be AMAZING. Yes, the game is old. But it is a GREAT game for LAN Parties. (And yes, to all of you who think LAN parties are dead, some people still have LAN parties. LOL, And offline LAN games are just far easier to set up due to not having to share my slow interwebs connection)  \n**Okay second request, a mod kit would be awesome...\n\nSo YES, spend the 99 cents on this game because its fun. And sometimes it goes on sale for 49 cents. Like, a can of Red Bull costs like $5. But mainly, the game is fun, its wacky, it does NOT take itself seriously and that is totally okay. \nPLAY WITH FRIENDS. It is fun and funny.
