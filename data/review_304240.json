This remastered version brilliantly preserves the original's terrifying essence while introducing modern gameplay refinements, such as optional updated controls and multiple display options that make the experience more accessible without sacrificing the game's core tension. The game's meticulously crafted environment remains a triumph of design, with fixed camera angles that transform each corridor into a potential nightmare and create an unparalleled sense of claustrophobic dread. Its resource management mechanics continue to set the standard for survival horror, forcing players to make strategic decisions about ammunition, health items, and exploration that elevate every encounter from simple combat to a nerve-wracking psychological challenge. The introduction of mechanics like the Crimson Head zombies adds an additional layer of strategic depth, ensuring that players can never truly feel safe and must carefully consider how they dispatch each enemy. While the visual upgrades might not be revolutionary, the atmospheric lighting, carefully preserved pre-rendered backgrounds, and the game's fundamental design create an experience that remains as compelling and frightening now as it was during its original release, proving that true horror transcends technological limitations.", "timestamp_created": 1737378024, "timestamp_updated": 1737378024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185992585": {"recommendationid": "185992585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140792707", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 641, "playtime_at_review": 1298, "last_played": 1736910389}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Espectacular a a a a", "timestamp_created": 1737345598, "timestamp_updated": 1737345598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185987392": {"recommendationid": "185987392", "author": {"steamid": "76561199727572158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1736380162}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games of all time IMO.

I'll have to wait for the remake to play it because this is just too clunky for me, especially since I didn't grow up with the franchise and have never had to deal with similar mechanics. It's an old game of course which excuses the technical limitations of the time, but that doesn't mean that it has aged well.\n\nThings that I don't like:\n-It feels like there's no point in using the handgun. I have however never fought any bosses or any other enemies than the regular zombies so I'm not convinced that it's useless.\n-Dodging zombies feels really inconsistent. I know that you're supposed to get close enough for them to lunge at you and then run past them while they're in \"recovery\". This works, but only sometimes. Every once in a while they just never enter recovery mode so you're forced to take a hit anyway or waste a defensive item.\n-The fixed camera angles make it difficult to understand where you are and where you're going as well as the dimensions of the area that you're currently in. This makes it feel like you're forced to use the tank controls if you want to move normally between cameras which makes it pointless to add modern controls (character moves in the direction that you're pressing). I don't know how many times I've ran into a wall because I couldn't see what was right in front of my character.\n-At least I haven't found it, but there's no \"memory/note\" system that puts a note on the map saying what kind of key item you're missing like there are in the modern titles. This means that unless you memorize everything or write it all down, you're gonna end up running back and forth between places because you didn't remember that you had to use one key item while having another.\n-Ink ribbons as a concept is annoying. I understand that the concept of them is that you're supposed to be punished for making mistakes, but the first playthrough is just a bunch of trial and error which means that you'll have to play the same thing over and over again just because you ran out of ink ribbons. The worst part about them however is that they take up an inventory slot while you're already limited to 6 or 8 spaces (depending on character). Add key items to that and you'll have next to no space for consumables.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't give it a go yourself. You might actually end up enjoying it and I wish I could too, but it's just not a game for me.", "timestamp_created": 1736989710, "timestamp_updated": 1736989710, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185662193": {"recommendationid": "185662193", "author": {"steamid": "76561199522384948", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 429, "playtime_at_review": 2452, "last_played": 1736965800}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1736966167, "timestamp_updated": 1736966167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185656162": {"recommendationid": "185656162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362727075", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "deck_playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1734610413}, "language": "german", "review": "Nehme mir 1x im Jahr vor dieses game endlich zurchzuziehen und muss jedes mal nach 20min ausmachen weils einfach echt in die Jahre gekommen ist.

There's extremely minute changes to the gameplay and as such, veterans will be able to sink right in. I cannot stress how important this is for remaking a video game. DON'T ALTER THE CORE GAMEPLAY!\n\nSecondly, the additions that were made didn't subtract from the experience. For example, you can now hold self-defense items that can save you from being chomped on by a zombie - a tool mostly meant for newbie players that may have difficulty juking through enemies. \n\nBut then there's the Crimson Head mechanic - if you put down a zombie, after a certain amount of time, they will reanimate into a redder, faster, and more dangerous zombie. Now, if you know anything about the pre-RE4 Resident Evil games, killing monsters is secondary to the main gameplay of just getting from A to B. The monsters are just mere obstacles in your path, so you shouldn't really be spending resources killing them. The Remake decides to punish players who do with Crimson Heads. Again, mostly there for newbies. \n\nVeterans of the original game will have little trouble with this Remake albeit for maybe Lisa - one of the other additions of the Remake, and I would argue its worst one. With Lisa's addition came a few brand new areas and the boss character herself. I personally feel it needlessly elongates the game a bit (not anything too severe. You can still beat this game in less than 2 hours if you know what you're doing). While I don't like Lisa's addition, at least it doesn't overstay its welcome and most of all, it doesn't radically change the gameplay mechanics to something that the original never had you do. \n\nI of course recommend this game without question. If you liked the 1996 game and want to see it graphically enhanced, experience tighter controls, and hear better voice-acting (alas no meme-worthy Jill Sandwiches this time), pick this game up. \nIf you're new to the series or have never played this specific entry before, I also recommend it if you are looking for a fun little maze/puzzle-box game to solve. While the tank-control movement may take getting used to, you can also use the Altermate Controls (but take heed: whenever the camera angle switches, you might need to jerk your analog stick in a different direction for your character to move correctly). Just know that the enemies you encounter (especially early on in the game) aren't worth wasting your ammo on. It's more about just getting from A to B: use this item to unlock a door so you can get a new item to unlock another door somewhere else.\n\nI really wish Capcom would look back at this Remake and use it as the guide on how to make their future remakes, because... good lord. Those new remakes are so half-assed and barely even capture what made the originals liked to begin with.", "timestamp_created": 1736526722, "timestamp_updated": 1736526975, "voted_up": true,

Despite being an older game, it still holds up remarkably well, thanks to its excellent design and atmosphere.\n\nThe visuals are a standout feature. The character models look fantastic, even by today\u2019s standards, and the game exudes a cozy yet terrifying vibe. The Spencer Mansion is a masterpiece of design, blending haunting shadows and eerie silence with sudden bursts of tension that keep you on edge throughout.\n\nOne of the game\u2019s strengths lies in its ability to deliver genuine scares. Even if you\u2019re a veteran gamer, you\u2019ll likely find yourself startled by many moments. The horror is enhanced by the game\u2019s focus on survival\u2014scarce resources, limited saves, and enemies that can be relentless add to the tension.\n\nHowever, the difficulty can be a double-edged sword. For newcomers or players unfamiliar with the original, the puzzles can feel overwhelming at times. Personally, I found the puzzles challenging but rewarding, though they occasionally broke the flow of the game. Still, their presence adds to the mystery and sense of accomplishment when solved.\n\nThe story is another strong point. It\u2019s full of mystery, intriguing characters, and twists that keep you invested. As a fan of horror narratives, I\u2019d love to see more stories like this one in future games.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 1 Remake is a brilliant update to a classic. It\u2019s scary, atmospheric, and engaging, though its difficulty might not be for everyone.

Unfortunately, the gameplay feels quite janky by modern standards. The game features a variety of atmospheric locations, several puzzles, and lots of interesting items to collect and utilize. If you can stomach the fixed camera angles and all the quirks, I highly recommend giving this game at least one playthrough.\n\nThe environments are both beautifully crafted and at the same time eerily dark, damp, and deteriorated. The mansion can feel like a maze during your first playthrough, which adds to the sense of mystery. The audio design significantly enhances the mood\u2014squeaking floorboards, dripping water, thunder, howling wind, and moaning zombies evoke classic old-school horror movie vibes.\n\nI played through the game for the first time without any guides or mods, but I recommend installing the door animation fix as soon as possible. Those unnecessarily long door-opening animations clearly don\u2019t belong in the remake. The game also has some frustrating issues with colliders. For example, you might aim at a pickup or point of interest and miss it, leading you to think it\u2019s not interactable. This can be especially frustrating since the game doesn\u2019t provide visual highlights for interactive objects. Some doors are also hard to spot, and at least three gave me trouble during my first playthrough.\n\nA couple of puzzles stumped me, and I had to get help. The waterfall puzzle was particularly frustrating, and another one failed simply because of a collider issue\u2014it turned out my aim wasn\u2019t precise enough. The story, however, turned out to be much longer than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nBoth tank controls and the alternative control scheme are clunky, requiring too much concentration to be enjoyable. These can be of cause learned, but the controls are far from being intuitive. Many of the horror moments come not from atmosphere but from the difficulty of aiming or navigating. You\u2019re often forced to aim at enemies outside the static camera view, which can be frustrating and unintuitive. Overall, combat is the weakest part of the game. Despite being a \"survival horror\" title, combat often feels more like a test of patience. It\u2019s largely about maneuvering around enemies and trying to get a shot in without getting hit or bitten. Newer Resident Evil remakes handle this aspect much better, so if you\u2019re new to the series, consider starting with Resident Evil 2 Remake instead!\n\nI never played the original game back in the day (despite owning Capcom/RE art books and always liking the series\u2019 concept), nor did I try this version when it first came out. However, it\u2019s easy to see why this game remains so beloved. There are small variations in the story depending on how you play, multiple endings, and the option to start with either Jill or Chris, each offering slightly different gameplay experiences. The game also features three difficulty settings. I naturally started with \"Very Easy\" to focus on experiencing the story. Completing playthroughs unlocks additional content, like new difficulty modes and alternative costumes.\n\nSo if you can look past these issues, RE is still mostly very enjoyable, fun old-school game at its core. Simply don\u2019t expect anything too serious horror stuff, but this game has its share of scary moments.", "timestamp_created": 1736364165, "timestamp_updated": 1736421992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185115981": {"recommendationid": "185115981", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247882092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 725, "playtime_at_review": 1286, "last_played": 1736350485}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u7269\u304c\u6301\u3066\u306a\u3055\u904e\u304e\u3066\u7121\u7406\u3002\u884c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u6765\u305f\u308a\u304c\u9762\u5012\u3059\u304e\u308b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1736351146, "timestamp_updated": 1736351146, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185101310": {"recommendationid": "185101310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206823421", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 1421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1027, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1736355440}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Resident Evil HD Remaster breathes new life into the original survival horror masterpiece that started it all. This updated version of the 1996 classic doesn't just polish the visuals, it elevates the entire experience while maintaining the core elements that made the original so iconic. For fans of the genre and newcomers alike, this remaster offers an unforgettable journey into the Spencer Mansion's terrifying corridors.[/b]\n\n[h1]A Return to Survival Horror\u2019s Roots[/h1]\n[b]The remaster revisits the classic story of Resident Evil, where players step into the shoes of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, members of the elite S.T.A.R.S. team, sent to investigate mysterious murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. What follows is a horrifying descent into the heart of the Spencer Mansion, a labyrinth of secrets, puzzles, and grotesque monstrosities.\nThe game stays true to its roots, focusing on tension, resource management, and environmental storytelling. Even after all these years, the mansion is as haunting and enigmatic as ever.[/b]\n\n[h1]Enhanced Visuals and Atmosphere[/h1]\n[b]The updated graphics in the HD Remaster are a standout feature. The pre-rendered backgrounds are beautifully remastered, with enhanced lighting and textures bringing the creepy atmosphere of the Spencer Mansion to life. Shadows flicker, lightning illuminates the dark hallways, and every creak of the floorboards feels more immersive than ever.\nThe game\u2019s sound design is another highlight, with eerie background music and haunting ambient noises adding to the tension. It\u2019s a game that demands to be played with headphones for the full effect.[/b]\n\n[h1]Refined Controls: Old and New[/h1]\n[b]One of the biggest improvements is the addition of modernized controls. The tank controls of the original, while still available for purists, are now complemented by an alternative control scheme that feels more fluid and intuitive. This makes the game more accessible for new players while preserving the challenge and suspense that defined the original.[/b]\n\n[h1]Puzzles and Exploration: Engaging and Rewarding[/h1]\n[b]The remaster retains the intricate puzzles and exploration that were a hallmark of the original. From cryptic riddles to hidden keys, each discovery feels satisfying and rewarding. The layout of the mansion itself is a puzzle, with shortcuts, locked doors, and secret pathways that gradually reveal themselves as you progress.[/b]\n\n[h1]Survival Horror at Its Best[/h1]\n[b]Resident Evil HD Remaster captures the essence of survival horror. Resources like ammunition and healing items are scarce, forcing players to make strategic choices and manage their inventory carefully. Every encounter with a zombie or monstrous creature feels tense and consequential, with death always lurking around the corner.\nThe addition of Crimson Heads, zombies that can resurrect into faster, deadlier versions if not disposed of properly, adds a new layer of fear and strategy, ensuring that even areas you thought were \u201csafe\u201d remain a source of dread.[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Stunning visual overhaul: Pre-rendered backgrounds and lighting effects look gorgeous and atmospheric.\n[*]Refined controls: The addition of modern controls makes the game more accessible.\n[*]Classic survival horror: Maintains the tension, resource management, and puzzle-solving that define the genre.\n[*]Improved sound design: Creepy ambient noises and music enhance the eerie atmosphere.\n[*]Faithful to the original: Captures the essence of what made the original Resident Evil a masterpiece.\n[*]Crimson Heads: A chilling new twist to the zombie threat.\n[*]Multiple playthroughs encouraged: With two characters (Chris and Jill), different endings, and challenging modes, replayability is high.\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Fixed camera angles: While iconic, they can feel dated to some players and make combat tricky.\n[*]Limited inventory space: Adds to the challenge but can be frustrating at times.\n[*]Pace may feel slow: The deliberate pacing and backtracking might not appeal to players unfamiliar with older games.\n[*]No major story changes: Veterans of the original may find little new content in terms of narrative.\n[*]Lack of accessibility options: Limited features for modern accessibility standards.\n[/list]\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n[b]Resident Evil HD Remaster is a masterclass in remaking a classic. It preserves the charm and terror of the original while improving on its visuals, controls, and overall presentation. This is survival horror at its finest, with a haunting atmosphere, engaging puzzles, and relentless tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\nFor longtime fans, it\u2019s a nostalgic trip back to the Spencer Mansion with a fresh coat of paint. For newcomers, it\u2019s a fantastic way to experience one of gaming\u2019s most influential titles. Despite a few dated mechanics, the remaster is a must-play for anyone looking to explore the roots of survival horror.

It is the first Resident Evil with the original, first Protagonists Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. It is a classic, yeah, but it really is not a great game... except if you count looking up guides, quickly dying, reverse controls depending on which angle you changed on, not saving as frequent and not being able to aim propely as fun. I would not say this is a remake, more of a remaster since it does not change any of it's original aspects. Which for some is great, for me it is a disaster.\n\nLooking up a guide and realizing I am 10 hours into the game while the guide is at 2 hours out of 4, I am loosing my mind! Dying after an hour progress without saving is HORRIBLE and the game feels empty. There is no 3D sound, no music playing except at some parts and you are filled with the crows in your ears and the empty sounding footsteps. \n\nYou may say I'm a New-Gen if I dislike the Perspectives of the camera, and it's true, I'm quite a new fan towards the franchise but comparing this to the newer games, even Resident Evil 4 - 2005, it should def. stay in the past lol. I really wish this game could get a new new remake with modern aspects since I fear the story would be more dramatic and exciting with better Game Play because it does not feel rewarding to get a story Cut-Scene after hours of \"grinding\".\n\nIt's so hard to get lost easily and I really pushed myself playing this.

It runs smoothly and still looks gorgeous, even after all these years. And the modern controls still break this game similar to how Full Active Mode breaks the combat system in Star Ocean 3. That\u2019s about it. Instead of reviewing this particular release of REmake1, I\u2019ll share my thoughts on the game as a whole:\n\nObviously, REmake1 is a must-play for anyone who enjoys classic survival horror. Personally, I\u2019ve played, completed, and 100%-ed this game countless times since its original release on the Nintendo GameCube. It\u2019s a prime example of how to remake a game, and also of how to do classic survival horror right. At least, that\u2019s what I thought.\n\nHowever, when I played it again on Steam, I started to notice its weird pacing. The game feels somewhat stretched out in parts - if you know what I mean. Some of the improvements are great, but the game often has you running back and forth between two points way too many times. I\u2019m not talking about returning to the mansion with a new key - I\u2019m talking about literally running between two locations that are only four or five rooms apart. Then there are other annoyances, like not being allowed to run while carrying the nitro. There\u2019s the broken door handle, the repetitive trips in the underground tunnels to get that broken flamethrower, and the frustrating statue puzzle to get the cylinder shaft. Overall there are just way too many slow and repetative parts, where you have to push stuff. And none of the puzzles requires any real thinking either.\n\nUsually, in RE, after collecting all the trophies, I do one last perfect run with each character, gathering every item along the way and putting them in a nice order within the item box. But with REmake1, I skipped doing that with Chris because I was already fed up with the game\u2019s odd pacing. I even had to resort to outfit mods and mods that skip the door animations to make the nine playthroughs a little more tolerable.", "timestamp_created": 1735730751, "timestamp_updated": 1735730926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184408048": {"recommendationid": "184408048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200453982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1507, "last_played": 1735891469}, "language": "english", "review": "The evil is a resident", "timestamp_created": 1735719249, "timestamp_updated": 1735719249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184398250": {"recommendationid": "184398250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199511440404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 680, "last_played": 1735497631}, "language": "english", "review": "Love!", "timestamp_created": 1735708918, "timestamp_updated": 1735708918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184397556": {"recommendationid": "184397556", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100730172", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1721, "last_played": 1734360473}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Literalmente uma resid\u00eancia maligna, cinema", "timestamp_created": 1735708190, "timestamp_updated": 1735708190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184394258": {"recommendationid": "184394258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391531604", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 757, "last_played": 1735700961}, "language": "english", "review": "I wouldn't say this game was for me. The gameplay was painfully slow and accompanied by occasional ridiculous puzzles that would have added at least 3 more hours to my playtime if I wasn't guided through them.

The retro graphics added to that uneasiness, but surprisingly, they also created to an odd feeling of coziness while exploring the mansion. And if we exclude the few ridiculous puzzles, most of them were actually quite fun to figure out. Also, the lore drops were very interesting and important to fill the gaps of knowledge that I had so far in the resident evil series.

The game takes place in an enclosed space with limited resources which are often dangerous to obtain, especially if you haven't cleared the enemies or, worse yet, killed the zombies without burning them or destroying their heads.\r\nBacktracking is not only dangerous but necessary due to the limited inventory and manual saving system so there are real choices to be made when it comes to moving around the mansion, what enemies to avoid, which ones to kill, and, perhaps most important of all, when to save.\r\nThis last aspect is what prevents me from saying that Resident Evil is perfect (the game is that good) because a new player has no way of knowing ahead of time how often they should save. \r\nFor those who don't know, saving is a limited resource in Resident Evil because it requires ink ribbons that the player needs to find like any other item. This helps enhance the tension but it also promotes exploring as far as you can go, making notes of what you need to do and then reloading to try and maximize how much you do with each save. This is clearly overkill since you can save pretty comfortably and with ribbons to spare every 15-20 minutes (probably 5 on very easy) but I had no idea as a new player. Perhaps this says more about my own personality, but I digress.\r\nThe rest of the gameplay is quite good. Even the original tank controls have been retouched with the ability to do a quick turn and I think I prefer them over the modern setting for playing on a keyboard. There isn't much to say about the combat since aiming is largely automatic, it's more about the resource management aspect (ammo and inventory space in this case).\r\nThe presentation is nothing short of fantastic. Even the rejected concept art for this game was great, the mansion is beautiful and I love the sound effects.\r\nTo conclude, it was hard for me to get into the game but I'm glad I stuck around because it's totally worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1735483828, "timestamp_updated": 1735483828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557291626930236816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184089834": {"recommendationid": "184089834", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233709333", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1736016373}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044e \u0431\u0430\u0442\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u044f \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a \u043e\u0442 capcom \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1735472922, "timestamp_updated": 1735472965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184082587": {"recommendationid": "184082587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053068841", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1735467828}, "language": "english", "review": "All you do in this game is find keys to open doors and listen to really poorly written dialog.

The game was extended with new locations and other things, but that also made it a lot more boring due to the back-and-forth necessity to get items and solve puzzles. I'd prefer to see a *real* remastered edition of 1995's RE, with bigger resolutions and improved graphics instead of a game with outdated resolutions that use the same old graphics retouched and badly upscaled; and a strange 3D mix implementation that not always fit them.\n\nI am still a fan of Resident Evil, so replaying this remastered edition 30 years later makes me admit that the original was much scarier and fun to play than this one. Unconditional lovers will always debate what I'm saying, but, frankly, the HD edition didn't convince me much and doesn't stand as a decent honor to the original of 1995. The new contents added didn't really added more interest; only boredom and tiredness in most of the times.\n\nI can recommend this game to survival horror fans just because it's pretty playable and has a good atmosphere, but I'll leave a note that in an overall comparison with 1995's original, it doesn't beat it.

"review": "A very nice game that can take some time getting used to. My first ever proper Resident Evil game, I initially started as Jill on Normal Difficulty, and quickly found myself running out of ammo and getting killed. I ended up beating my first game on Very Easy, which indeed felt too easy in comparison. My second playthrough was as Chris on Easy and I found it decently challenging while not too hard, as once you have explored the entire game in your first playthrough, every other one will be much less tedious.\n\nThe biggest tips a new player can get are to avoid killing enemies that aren't in the way, and to not pick up everything you see unless you know for sure you need to. The former helps to avoid unnecessarily wasting ammo and getting hurt in fights you shouldn't be getting into, and the latter helps you not need to constantly backtrack and run through the same halls to make trips to the nearest item box, which quickly becomes a huge slog to do. Resident Evil is not a typical action game, and this one especially has a heavy usage of puzzles and strategy, and trying to play like a typical shooter will be frustrating.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil Remake is a very good game once you get used to the controls, combat, and understand the kind of mindset the game wants you to play with.", "timestamp_created": 1735111069, "timestamp_updated": 1735111069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183627921": {"recommendationid": "183627921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992836094", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1735166419}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Cara vou ser sincero, talvez eu tenha errado em jogar os \u00faltimos resident evils antes de jogar esse, porqu\u00ea a minha perspectiva ta muito diferente, estou demorando muito pra me adaptar as longas caminhadas e a dificuldade intensa do jogo( que pra alguns \u00e9 muito f\u00e1cil, mas estou no sufoco). Por\u00e9m apesar de todas as adversidades AMO O JOGO, estou me esfor\u00e7ando ao m\u00e1ximo e sinto que era isso que faltava em minhas jogatinas recentes, a vontade de dar tudo de mim em um jogo e experienciar a dificuldade e os quebra-cabe\u00e7as me deixa com vontade de quero mais, obviamente fico preso as vezes e dependo de uma ajuda como o youtube ou um blog, mas a comunidade \u00e9 muito interativa e reciproca quando se trata de ajudar, j\u00e1 que muitos j\u00e1 ficaram ou ficam presos em certas partes que por exemplo eu passei com facilidade. Logo tenho s\u00f3 coisas boas a dizer desse jogo, entre nessa experi\u00eancia e sinta-se feliz em morrer as vezes e recome\u00e7ar, porque as vezes \u00e9 melhor refazer do que fazer porcamente. Minha nota \u00e9 10/10, tem terror (o jogo \u00e9 de 2014 com gr\u00e1ficos medianos pra \u00e9poca se parar pra pensar e me deu CALAFRIOS mano, bizarro como uma simples anima\u00e7\u00e3o de porta abrindo pode te amedrontar), o \u00e1udio do jogo e BIZARRO de perfeito, tanto as falas como o ambiente, por exemplo, se voc\u00ea andar na madeira faz um som de pisar forte em madeira, mas a partir do momento que voc\u00ea encosta no carpete o som fica abafado, simplesmente \u00c9PICO, a \"dublagem\" em ingl\u00eas \u00e9 CINEMA, tipo ajuda de mais a forma como eles falam para voc\u00ea ficar entretido na hist\u00f3ria e voc\u00ea sente a emo\u00e7\u00e3o e o sentimento do personagem no momento, os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o bons, podiam ser melhores em minha opini\u00e3o, mas a est\u00e9tica ta perfeita ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o mudaria nada.

began[/b]... well sort of.\n\nThis is a remaster of one of the most iconic games in history, Resident Evil. From updated visuals and controls, this is a wonderful way to introduce new-comers to the series, but also keeping close to it's roots. And if you're feeling particularly nostalgic, or if you don't have skill issues like me, you can opt to use the original control scheme, the infamous tank controls.\n\nIf this is you're first rodeo with the Resident Evil (Biohazard) series, the basics is this; you play as either S.T.A.R.S. member Jill \"Sandwich\" Valentine or Chris \"Boulder-puncher\" Redfield. Both have different abilities, such as Jill having more inventory space or Chris having more health (Pick Jill). You will explore a large mansion estate, solving puzzles and unlocking doors as you investigate the disappearance of fellow comrades and questioning the architect who designed this mansion. You'll also encounter enemies, from zombies to oversized snakes. You'll need to find resources to help combat these foes: ammunition, weapons, and herbs for healing. However, resources and your inventory space is limited, so it's not wise to dump all your bullets into every zombie you come across. You will have to pick and choose your battles, especially in the beginning. If you like me at the end you'll probably just start shooting everything. \n\nThe game plays in fixed camera angles, unlike modern Resident Evil games. But I think that helps add to the tension, not being able to see what's around the corner. But please keep that in mind if your not a fan of that.\n\nSo, if you like survival horror, why not give the father of all survival horror a try?", "timestamp_created": 1735000547, "timestamp_updated": 1735002253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183520946": {"recommendationid": "183520946", "author": {"steamid": "76561199560025747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1720040081}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Bana kal\u0131rsa en iyi hayatta kalma/korku oyun t\u00fcr\u00fcn\u00fcn \u00f6rne\u011fi olan resident evil serisinin ilk kur\u015funu 10/9 *kamera a\u00e7\u0131lar\u0131 :/*", "timestamp_created": 1734995805, "timestamp_updated": 1734995805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183520799": {"recommendationid": "183520799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868966440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1399, "last_played": 1735253050}, "language": "english", "review": "GET THIS GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME", "timestamp_created": 1734995656, "timestamp_updated": 1734995656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 23581, "total_negative": 2096, "total_reviews": 25677}, "cursors": {"AoJw2c/+vZMDd/qwsgU=": "Mon Jan 20 17:43:11 2025"}}
