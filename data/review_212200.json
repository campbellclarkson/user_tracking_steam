But I can't say this game is for me. Just like Maple Story, too many windows, too many hot keys to memorize. Too many annoying alters about things that do not involve you learning to play the game.\n\nBiggest bummer is the Hit point system. I get a character can wound you as a status effect to hinder your combat and make it more difficult. But the fact you can't heal in combat if you are wounded. You cannot use a first aid on yourself when in combat is not how I like to play my MMO RPGS. Top it off the cost of items in the game if you just want to explore are kind of high. You need 10 bandages to fix your wounded status that is 500 gold coins. Your enemies maybe drop 50 coins but mostly useless crafting stuff.\n\nWhen trying to do the main quests to level up my skills. What irked me... I cannoy say annoy but it get frustrating and angering is all the filler trash dialog in the game that really has nothing to do with story or your development. I had to Alt+F4 a few times because the dialog got so frustrating along with the constant announcements about different things and quest reminders.\n\nIdk for a free to play game it is well made I guess, but for me, looking for an online MMO that lets me do whatever... This game isn't it. This game is frustrating in all the wrong ways from how you move around, to the combat, to the need to learn every stupid thing in order to progress slightly.\n\nThis game is an easy 2 out of 10 for me.
