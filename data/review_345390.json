I must say that I am impressed and was thoroughly entertained! I added chapter one many years ago, but just now got around to playing it. Fantastically fun! The voice talents are top notch! The animation is clear, quirky, and well done! Wonderfully humorous! I knew after just a few minutes of playing that I would enjoy it immensely, so I purchased the season pass for the rest of the chapters, currently on Steam sale, so act quick and get a great price on all of the chapters of this great game! The only warning I would give people is to remember to change your save slots if you want to experience different choices without replaying the entire game; the game has an autosave feature, and I got to 100% completion before I realised I could change save slots. There are only 4 save slots though, and I don't think that you need to save multiple copies all the way through the game, but remember to save before the final battle, where different choices would yield different endings (which I didn't do). Oh well, I will enjoy playing through right from the start again! Maybe after I do all the other chapters; after all, I only did just complete chapter one (which is FREE)!
