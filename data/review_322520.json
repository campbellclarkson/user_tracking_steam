It plays like an older warriors title.[/h1]\n\nThat out of the way, let me clarify this about the game: It is an old title, and it shows. But unlike its sequel/downgrade in DW9R, this does right what that game does wrong. Walk with me and we'll discuss the pros and cons.\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n01. The game plays like a Warriors title. This may not seem like something important at first glance, or may even seem like it should be a no-brainer, but the fact that DW9E lost the plot and forgot to make itself into a hack-and-slash, commander focused playstyle for capturing bases and overcoming challenges puts this as a point in the book that needs to be said.\n\n02. Character creation is simple, but good. You aren't getting anywhere near Skyrim, but there are enough options here to have fun with and you can customize your custom character's abilities quite well, giving them a far more unique approach and flair to things compared to the sequel.\n\n03. In Empires mode there are other things to do. Far more in it than DW9E there are many more things you can do. Raise your own kingdom, become emperor (RNG event), be an assassin, be a free agent forever, betray your lord, and so much more.\n\n04. CUSTOM INVADERS. This is something that, somehow, is still running and I don't know how or why. But when you have entire units of others peoples custom characters floating about and entering the game later on as old generic commanders die out or just replaced over time it gives some fun RNG to every Empires campaign. I had the Cat Girl alliance fighting Naruto Ninjas for the Northern half of China. It's hilarious as an option, and a lost one in the sequel.\n\n05. Lastly, it's fun. Nothing more, nothing less, it is a fun game. If you are a fan of older Warriors titles, it is a fun time. Not as fast as some new ones, but you can have some pretty fun battles in it. I had to buy enough time for my armies to take the map and connect the main camp to the enemy's because Lu Bu and five of his boys were trying to rush the opposite way and just rush my main camp and no one but me could handle them.\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\nThere are some cons. Don't get me wrong. Translation isn't the greatest, some cutscenes and events are woefully incomplete, I wish there were MORE enemies on-screen and this much DLC at these prices are pretty much a crime to me...But if you don't care about the additional cosmetics, don't care about the castle or scenario pack, don't care for the additional edit voices? It's a great game. DLC is fine if you buy it on sale, but I sincerely say only buy the edit parts as that's where you'll get most of the enjoyment out of it. It's better than DW9E, so if you're making a choice between the two I am giving you a whole-hearted endorsement of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1736303579, "timestamp_updated": 1736303666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539007067680358887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185061336": {"recommendationid": "185061336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973153131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1735260975}, "language": "english", "review": "Horrible optimization and experience on both keyboard and controller.
