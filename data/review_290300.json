A lot of combat, maybe even a little excessive, but it is quite enjoyable for the relatively short duration of the game. One of the few games I have seen where you get to pilot a huge spaceship and take part in big space battles without killing your computer.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that there is little to no incentive to replay the game. The combat and progression are only enjoyable for one playthrough. Dialogues are very linear to the point you are just pressing a continue button. Story is very basic, most conversations not very interesting, but it is acceptable. Still a better love story than Baldur's Gate 3.\r\n\r\nEngine impaired/10, it is pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1737330687, "timestamp_updated": 1737330687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185691032": {"recommendationid": "185691032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392975536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2215, "playtime_at_review": 2215, "last_played": 1736989801}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very nice little game.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is short, but the corner of the galaxy you're in has its charm, with well voice acted character, excellent soundtracks (which you can customize. Personally I went with Cowboy Bebop), and very beautiful graphics that renders space and spaceships spectacularly well.\r\n\r\nWhere Rebel Galaxy truly shines is its gameplay loop. It is basically a progression to the top, looking for better guns to put on bigger ships with thicker shields. The progression isn't all vertical though.\r\nI had much fun getting right behind bigger ships with my more manoeuvrable corvettes and drilling their hull where they couldn't blast me. Or escaping swarms of fighters, only to slow down a bit and snipe a few before fleeing again.\r\nAdditionally, while it wasn't my desire, you can very well roleplay as a more civilian entrepreneur, mining and trading enormous hauls to sell where the market is best. Combat is still very much an important factor, but you don't need to be a military dreadnought to roll over would be pirates.\r\n\r\nSo skill and style of gameplay have their place.\r\n\r\nPiloting a ship can be a bit strange at first, but the game ease you into it. It is on a 2d map, meaning you'll never have to manage the verticality, except for some fighters who fly all over the place, but automated turrets knows how to reach them.\r\n\r\nAs for the difficulty, do not worry too much. If you reach the limit of your skill, the game rewards patience and diligence. Do some missions, earn your money on a more manageable system, and then buy yourself a better equipment. It will make all the difference. By the end, I had the biggest ship fully upgraded, a flat death star, and only in the most dire situation did I need to manoeuvre a bit. Otherwise, I just had to be there, and rotate a bit for everything to explode around.\r\nIf you do missions though, nI recommend not taking any escort missions. The AI can be frustrating on several levels.\r\n\r\nFinally, the story.\r\nIt is short, but sweet. I was really hoping the end wasn't the end, the story of this weird chasing of mysterious artefacts with half the badlands gunning for us made me smile. I grew attached to the characters introduced (that I didn't kill for being double-crossing pyjacks), and I can only wish there would be more of them.\r\nBut it is just an adventure, with its heights, its doubts, its dangers, and in the end, its goodbyes.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a good game for a few hours of fun.
