I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for his birthday from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the day he had 13 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. Happy memories until it was not.

Starkiller est un personnage complexe, et son voyage ajoute une nouvelle dimension \u00e0 la saga.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Un gameplay ax\u00e9 sur la Force :\r\nL\u2019utilisation de pouvoirs surpuissants comme la pouss\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9clair ou la manipulation d\u2019objets est incroyablement satisfaisante. Chaque combat vous fait sentir la puissance d\u2019un utilisateur de la Force.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Des environnements vari\u00e9s et riches :\r\nVous parcourez des lieux embl\u00e9matiques et nouveaux de l\u2019univers Star Wars, comme Felucia, Kashyyyk ou encore l'\u00c9toile Noire. Chaque environnement est unique et regorge de d\u00e9tails.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Un combat dynamique :\r\nM\u00e9langez sabre laser et pouvoirs de la Force pour des combos spectaculaires. Les affrontements contre des ennemis vari\u00e9s, dont des AT-ST et des Rancors, sont \u00e9piques et mettent vos r\u00e9flexes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Un style cin\u00e9matique r\u00e9ussi :\r\nLes s\u00e9quences cin\u00e9matiques et les animations, bien que dat\u00e9es, restent impressionnantes gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la mise en sc\u00e8ne et aux performances des acteurs.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Une histoire bien int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans le canon :\r\nPour les fans de lore, le jeu d\u00e9veloppe des arcs int\u00e9ressants qui enrichissent l'univers Star Wars tout en proposant des surprises m\u00e9morables.\r\n\r\nLes Points Faibles :\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Un level design lin\u00e9aire :\r\nBien que les environnements soient d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, leur exploration est souvent limit\u00e9e.

All bossfights feel bland, pretty much all combat is the same and only terrain is your actual enemy (and fking being staggered and turned into a ragdoll), but the star destroyer \"fight\" was where I had enough, it's not even hard, simply boring and slow (some say it works better with some fix that remove the fps locks, but I don't even want to check that out), not to mention how unclear it is on mouse + keyboard, where it looks like you should put your mouse on a treadmill but in fact it works better when you make slow movements. I could probably write a book about how bad that whole mission was, yet all I'll add is, who tf thought it would be funny to add another one of the droid fights right before the fight with SD? \"my computer analysis says it's the best time for a surprise attack\", I was surprised that the enemy was trash and for once couldn't block every of my attacks and I could just spam everything on him with no effort...\n\nI starts of strong, tho very cliche, story is predictable since the beginning, further relying on cliche motives or straight up things from the movies, but it isn't too bad either, maybe some faces that Starkiller makes could be better as he looks bit too goofy at times. It's a tpp slasher so in the end it doesn't matter that much, all of the excuses to kill are just as good in the context of the game anyway.\n\nCombat beside it being \"throw/topple enemy or be staggered if there are more than 2 or at least one big enemy\" was fun at times, while at others it was a chore and not a fun one. I'd rather clean everyones toilet with my tongue than fight on small platforms or try to jump over endless pit when enemies have undodgeable attacks with hitboxes wither size of a barn or of an apple (maybe two), \"good\" thing is that it works both ways and some dash slashes or saber combos after turning to other enemy were hitting from 5m, but that's still a bad design even if fair. All that could be called a skill issue or maybe just a matter of not being used to ported games or even refusing to play on a controller (for a sec I though of borrowing one from a friend and then playing through castlevanias), but the fact that some enemies can turn you into a ragdoll, start another attack that will stagger you or once again turn you into a ragdoll and do that few times as the time it takes you to get up is sometimes just stupidly long (especialy when you slide down a tiniest ramp or bump). I don't mind waiting out attacks, looking for openings or using powers and environment, I do mind being unable to block, dodge or get out of a situation where I made the mistake, as it stimply does feel like a qte sequence, where this time finally you are punished for making a mistake (I don't think I made one that reduced my life, at least during boss battles, but it seems like qte magic gives you full invu just like every other cutscene (tho enemy AI is turned on and they do take actions all the time throughout them)).\n\nI'd say if you skip everything and just focus on the gameplay or finding the cholocrons it could be better, but you can't skip cutscenes, movies between the mission or anything else, so just watch a 100% speedrun to dinner or read the story recap on wiki.", "timestamp_created": 1735829942, "timestamp_updated": 1735829942, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184527490": {"recommendationid": "184527490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198841556089", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1021, "deck_playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1735820523}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanna start off by saying I remember playing both the PS2 & PS3 versions as a kid Loving them both (PS2 version is better imo) \n\nHowever I must say this Game has aged HORRENDOUSLY!\n\nStraight off the bat it's locked to 30fps so unless you download a community mod to uncap the fps then you're stuck with a 15+ yr old Game running at 30fp. However it's important to add that even if you do use the mod the physics are buggy af without the cap. \n\n(ALSO HALFWAY THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN THE AUDIO WILL BUG OUT MANUALLY REQUIRING YO TO DOWNLOAD LOST AUDIO FILES, SO FUN)\n\nSecondly the combat and missions are so mundane with spam lock enemies to saber duel that should be fun, but the combat just doesn't work 1v1. I.E The Darth Maul duel you have with proxy is so rigged with spam lock attacks that left me having to use force grip for the entire fight which sucked all the fun out of a fun call back.\n\nLastly are the overuse of QTE. RE4 couldn't do it and Aspyr sure as hell didn't. After whittling down an enemies health bar you're then treated to a clunky mini game where you'll have to stare at rather than the actual entertaining action onscreen. I don't even wanna talk about that stupid Star Destroyer QTE...\n\nSo is the Game bad? Maybe it's nostalgia, but I do actually enjoy the Games story, characters & customisation, plus the use of the Euphoria physics engine (throwing a Stormtrooper, Rodian or a poor defenceless Jawa into the abyss as they scream never gets old) \n\nI'm just saying if you haven't played the Game in awhile you might be sorely disappointed seeing how poorly it's aged in certain aspects and a terrible Port!\n\nWill add that the DLC and final mission are super fun!", "timestamp_created": 1735822802, "timestamp_updated": 1735823537, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499260693788528442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "184520316": {"recommendationid": "184520316", "author": {"steamid": "76561199750190836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1735957592}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 - God of War \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 GoW, \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0417\u0412 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e, \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u0440 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1735815998, "timestamp_updated": 1735815998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184519776": {"recommendationid": "184519776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033382687", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 349, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1733676505}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait sur un autre support et qui tant au niveau des graphismes que du gameplay a bien vieilli.

O jogo conta com gr\u00e1ficos realmente bons, sendo um jogo de 2008. Temos alguns poderes Jedi que se misturam com os do lado Sith. As m\u00fasicas s\u00e3o muito boas, me relembrando a nostalgia de assistir Star Wars. A jogabilidade pode ser realmente dif\u00edcil, e eu realmente precisei aprender a controlar o personagem e fazer cada movimento. A ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 muito boa, mas o que eu n\u00e3o gostei muito foi a hist\u00f3ria, que \u00e9 muito curta, e os personagens pouco desenvolvidos, sem muita import\u00e2ncia. Mas, mesmo assim, vale a pena jogar Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.
