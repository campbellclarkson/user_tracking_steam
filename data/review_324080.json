I had hoped when I decided to purchase Rising World a few days ago, that the game would have progressed more (had it in wishlist for awhile).\n\nI would normally do a pro/con list- but this game is simply early alpha (unity version) at this point.  I really wish steam would make it mandatory that Early Access games would be in Beta and only give them 6 months at that point to be finished, or akin to kickstarter- the money is refunded for not reaching a goal.  I stopped buying Early Access unless it was $10-$15 and showed quite a bit of promise.  I've learned from my mistakes on the games that want $25+ and then turn into vapor ware (frozen flame, and many others, anyone?)\n\nThe animations are clunky, the worlds are empty, no starting map (stop with the \"immersion\"- without a map/mini radar- this is not fun or cool, its just annoying at this point), the user interface is atrocious, drop down menus for crafting just add to click/click/click/click- no search option in recipe area, etc.  \n\nIt is also very disappointing that there is a 2 hour time limit for refund- it should be around 5 hours, especially on an open world/sandbox game, to see if it would be playable any further- cannot refund because I spent 4 entire hours in the game.  Not a dev issue- a steam issue which is garbage.\n\nI do believe the game has promise, but it should be in early access maybe 1 or 2 years from now.
