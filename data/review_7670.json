I chose the impossible. I chose...[b]Rapture[/b].[/i]\n\nThese ominous words fade away, towering submerged skyscrapers drifting into view from the deep. Their exteriors, once a fac\u0105de of extravagance now weathered from the weight of madness within and the thousands of tons of water all about them. Panicked voices flicker over the airwaves, and a feeling of foreboding sinks in as to what may lie in store within this sunken metropolis.\n\nThe cold open to [i]Bioshock[/i] is incredible, posing more questions than answers. You are plunged in the deep end (both physically and literally), into [i]Rapture[/i], an underwater society built for the hyper-elite, whose inhabitants have been perhaps indulging a little [i]too[/i] much on designer drugs.\n\nNow, before I go any further:\n\n[i][b]I'M PLAYING THIS GAME IN 2025[/b][/i]\n\nMy outlook is going to be predicated upon expectations set by playing successive works by other publishers. Having played [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/]SOMA[/url] recently, the bar was already set pretty high for games set in underwater cities, heck, even narrative games in general. Inherently, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Even Bioshock sits atop the shoulders of giants, being the 'little sister' of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/410710/System_Shock_Enhanced_Edition/]System Shock[/url] (hence the casual nod in the game's title - Bio[i]SHOCK[/i]). \n\nThat being said, Bioshock doesn\u2019t just hold up, it excels in many aspects.\n\nApart from being Jeff Bezos's wet dream (no pun intended) Rapture's anachronistic art direction is impeccable, harkening back to the class and futurism of the art deco architectural movement of the 1930s. Everything about the world sparks the imagination of the player, further supported by the plethora of audio tapes that scatter the city's sprawling corridors and passageways.\n\nMoreover, the story goes to some interesting places, though feels a little contrived at points, [spoiler]What was even the justification for the Little Sisters/Big Daddies? Is everything written off in the story as a biproduct of Adam-induced madness? The existence of Big Daddies as enemies seems shoehorned in.[/spoiler] it remains engaging and satisfying for the most part.\n\n[i][b]That all being said...[/b][/i]\nBioshock's gameplay can be a bit of a chore in places. \n[list]\n[*]The 'hacking' minigame is not much fun, and there are so many times you need to complete it considering the wide array of hackable machines, the gimmick very quicks grows tiresome.\n\n[*]Enemies quickly become bullet-sponges, and on account of limited ammunition to pick up, the use of guns becomes quickly unviable. This leads to more hacking minigames and delegating the job of fighting to hacked security drones (which I suppose quite neatly fits with the capitalist theming of the game).\n\n[*]The characters feel a little one-note and writing veers close to being expository in places.\n\n[*]A number of the plasmids feel functionally similar or have limited utility.\n[/list]\nWhile some aspects may be dated, Bioshock still creates an impeccable atmosphere and builds a world quite unlike any other seen before or after it. If you haven't played Bioshock, it deserves a play for these elements alone, even if the gameplay can feel occasionally dated.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1737271770, "timestamp_updated": 1737271811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185880133": {"recommendationid": "185880133", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025663081", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1737239993}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game the story the play through all enjoyable especially if you like high tensions and terroresque vibes there is alot of them to this game.

The dark underwater setting and environment is beautiful in its own way, but also pretty dark and unique. It's a really cool atmosphere that matches the dark themes of the game very well.\r\nAnd the story is also one of the best ones in gaming too. Definitly the best one in the triology. As you progress, you discover how Rapture came to be and what horrible things happened in it. And you find more about your own character later on. It also has one of the sickest plot twists ever.
