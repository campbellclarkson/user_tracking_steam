I spent countless hours playing it, and it holds a lot of nostalgic value for me. However, revisiting it after all these years was honestly disappointing. The game hasn't evolved at all in over 14 years.\n\nEverything is still the same: the graphics, the gameplay, and unfortunately, even the bugs and crashes. It feels like no effort was made to modernize or improve it, and that's just sad. What made it worse is the tiny player base \u2013 Steam charts show only around 46 concurrent players online. For an MMORPG, that\u2019s just not enough to make it feel alive.\n\nPlaying it again was a nostalgic trip, but also a clear reminder of why I already said goodbye back in 2014 when the EU servers shut down. I think it\u2019s time to let the game rest. Either shut it down or sell the rights to a studio that can rebuild it or create a renewed version that fits today\u2019s gaming standards.\n\nDragon Saga deserves to be remembered as a great part of the past, not as a zombie game limping on for a few more years.\n\n[i]P.S.: Don\u2019t let my Steam hours fool you \u2013 I spent thousands of hours back in the gPotato days.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1735493768, "timestamp_updated": 1735493768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183821228": {"recommendationid": "183821228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060446059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 2054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2054, "last_played": 1735256860}, "language": "english", "review": "This version somehow manages to be more glitchy than most versions of the past 20 years, including a lot of private servers and even the early days of the original game.
