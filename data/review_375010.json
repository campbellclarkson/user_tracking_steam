The trigonometry and differential calculus I studied in college is all wiped clean from my head.  However, I do have a head for math.  I can solve most simple equations in my head.  I can't really prove it, but I just tested myself out by doing 688+345 and 791*45 (first one was pretty quick, second one took a minute).  That doesn't really help when you need to calculate a dozen lines factored into even more combinations.  Things already got dicey after six puzzles, and I was trying to find a that would help me not have to try every combination of positive and negative numbers that adds up to 6, and once you\u2019ve got an imbalance in one or two lines, you can\u2019t tell if you have something wrong somewhere else unless you exhaust your options swapping out values.  It\u2019s so frustrating when you\u2019ve almost got it, but no matter how you tweak it, you can\u2019t grab the value you need.  You just can't use simple logic, you need some kind of system if you don't want to spend an hour plugging in different numbers on the same puzzle.\n\nI got a helpful pointer from a guide to add the smaller lines first and focus on those to model each puzzle, but it wasn\u2019t helping that much.  Then I realized something: there\u2019s already a natural imbalance in the sums of the lines and their components, because every component that\u2019s on an intersection between lines is counted twice.  This means the sum of those spaces must be the difference between the sum of the lines and the sum of all components, or L \u2013 C = S!  Excited by this discovery, I immediately sought to capitalize on it.  It didn\u2019t help.  I didn\u2019t get anything plugging random values equal to S, and it just meant more tedious calculations to find L, C, and S, then double checking them on the board.  \n\nThis game needed more indicators or tools for finding solutions and fewer cutscenes with reject Stellaris species, though I will be fair and point out that the cutscenes are skippable: spacebar to reveal the skip button + click it on the top right.  I am genuinely curious if anyone has a good system for solving these, because none of the guides or reviews I\u2019ve read actually describe one.  The testimonials mention rerolling the boards, notetaking, and brute-force guesswork.  I\u2019ve tried all of that, it hasn\u2019t usually helped, and it doesn\u2019t feel that rewarding when it does.  The next step after that, according to the forums and reviews, is to program an autosolver or download one from Github.  These don\u2019t sound like solutions to a game with well-balanced difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1737342748, "timestamp_updated": 1737344109, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185389932": {"recommendationid": "185389932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256092555", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1736635082}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u0141o mamunciu jak to \u017ale wygl\u0105da\nZagadki najni\u017cszego sortu", "timestamp_created": 1736635110, "timestamp_updated": 1736635110, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185307821": {"recommendationid": "185307821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010646448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 969, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1437729443}, "language": "english", "review": "Not Recommended", "timestamp_created": 1736559058, "timestamp_updated": 1736559058, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560869872570037842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 214, "total_negative": 97, "total_reviews": 311}, "cursors": {"AoJw/OK7xdwCe+6Sew==": "Mon Jan 20 18:24:52 2025"}}
