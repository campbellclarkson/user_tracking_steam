New Vegas expands upon Fallout 3 with more weapons, more perks, more crafting recipes, new unarmed/melee special attacks, a proper food/drink system, an improved armour system that reintroduces Damage Threshold (DT), ammo variants, weapon modding, and even card/gambling minigames. Most importantly, New Vegas has superb writing: world-building is highly consistent; everything has a proper lore explanation; factions are expertly-designed and have well-defined cultures/beliefs; quests have multiple solutions; and the story has many deviations depending on your choices. New Vegas' four story DLCs (Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road) are also some of the best DLC in gaming history. Make sure to buy the Ultimate Edition of this game, as New Vegas is not a complete game without all of its DLC.

Obsidian really knocked it out of the park with this one. The world of Fallout is one of my favorite to visit and this game has plenty to explore. Something to note is that much of this game is set in an open desert which I admit isn't super visually stimulating but there's plenty of unique spots to find within the desert and it makes finding towns and settlements that much more enjoyable but your mileage may vary. In terms of gameplay, this game does show its age in more ways than one, however I don't think this takes away from the game at all. Specifically the shooting in this game is a little janky and hard to get used to but personally I feel this adds to the experience because of V.A.T.S., the sort of auto aim mechanic in the game. Personally I don't have many issues aiming as I've gotten used to the game but for newcomers it can be a learning curve. In terms of the RPG aspect, this game passes with flying colors. You can customize your character a variety of ways and (especially without the DLC raising the level cap) it rewards you for doing multiple playthroughs by trying out different builds and perks. As for the story, there are multiple factions to engage with and the game gives you almost complete freedom on how you choose to deal with all of them. You can even reject them all and form your own path. The soundtrack is also phenominal from both the in-game radio and the overworld music. One minute you'll be listening to classic jazz and country tracks, the next you'll be listening to the creepy ambience as you explore a new cave or abandoned building. The voice acting also leaves little to be desired, with stellar performances all around for basically every character in the game. You will find that many characters sound quite similar, with voices like Liam O'brien and Yuri Lowenthal being used all over the game. This might detract from your immersion but personally I think they do an excellent job with all of their roles and make most of them sound unique. The main game of Fallout New Vegas is excellent in every way I could think of and delivers on everything I want from an RPG. That being said I found the DLCs to leave a little to be desired, especially Dead Money. A fair warning for new players, if you go into a DLC area (aside from the Lonesome Road) you will not be able to return to the main game until it is finished and all of these areas are very high level. The stories of these DLCs also continue and expand on much of the story of New Vegas's base game so I would advise to play them after finishing the game for the best experience. Dead money has a great story but is very flawed. If you did not level any melee abilities before going in, you will most likely have a hard time playing catch up because the guns found here are either not good or are hard to come by. It also has a mute character who uses sign language. Cool idea, horribly implemented. Honest Hearts is some more good old fashioned New Vegas to run around in and I personally found it very enjoyable and it expands well on the main story. Old World Blues is the wackiest of the bunch by far. Many new unique weapons to find and some great quality of life upgrades for your playthrough. I didn't really care for the story, the main characters will talk at you for literally almost 20 minutes straight with nothing interesting to say other than \"funny\" fart jokes to keep you entertained. Thankfully there is an option to skip all this dialogue which I have used to great use on my many playthroughs. Finally, The Lonesome Road is a great capstone for the game. Your mileage with the story in this one may vary, but the gameplay in this new area is fantastic with many new challenging enemies and awesome areas to explore. With that being said, I do not think the DLC is mandatory to play to enjoy New Vegas to it's fullest. I think the best part of the game is the main game and I often don't even go into the DLC unless I'm doing a full run. If you've been on the fence about trying this one, or even just want a good game to play, play it. It will be worth your time and money. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1737129374, "timestamp_updated": 1737129733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185788676": {"recommendationid": "185788676", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123902866", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1411, "playtime_at_review": 4811, "last_played": 1737329077}, "language": "english", "review": "blew my mind", "timestamp_created": 1737128150, "timestamp_updated": 1737128150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185787996": {"recommendationid": "185787996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304121390", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1641817922}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the most legendary games ever the lore is so crazy", "timestamp_created": 1737127535, "timestamp_updated": 1737127535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185786308": {"recommendationid": "185786308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342324538", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 23347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23347, "last_played": 1707632461}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE.

"review": "Ah, Fallout: New Vegas, where every day is a gamble, and your luck stat might determine if you survive a gecko attack or accidentally barter away your pants for a bottle cap. This game is like a post-apocalyptic buffet: radioactive, unpredictable, and guaranteed to give you heartburn\u2014in the best way possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you wake up with a massive headache and a bad case of bullet-to-the-brain syndrome, you know you\u2019re in for a wild ride. The opening scene is iconic: a robot cowboy digs you out of the dirt, and a guy in a checkered suit shoots you in the face. Classic Vegas hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe characters are unforgettable. There's Boone, the broody sniper who would probably win \"Most Likely to Stare at the Mojave Sunset Dramatically.\" Then there's Mr. House, a reclusive billionaire who\u2019s basically Howard Hughes with more robots and fewer tissues. And let\u2019s not forget Yes Man, the cheerful AI that\u2019s suspiciously cool with you taking over the world.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay? Chef\u2019s kiss. You can negotiate peace between factions, become a master of diplomacy... or just punch Deathclaws in the face with spiked knuckles. The choice is yours. Oh, and the glitches? Think of them as Bethesda\u2019s love letters to you. Sure, your companion might float into the sky or you might accidentally fall through the map into the abyss, but hey, it\u2019s all part of the charm.\r\n\r\nThe factions are the real stars here. You\u2019ve got the NCR, who are basically your nerdy cousins trying to bring order to chaos. Then there\u2019s Caesar\u2019s Legion, who thought, \u201cHey, what if Ancient Rome, but terrible?\u201d And of course, the New Vegas Strip itself, where you can gamble, get rich, and immediately blow it all on energy weapons.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s moral dilemmas really make you think. Like, should I nuke a town of innocent people or help an old ghoul live his astronaut dreams? And why do I feel so bad every time I steal a single potato from a rundown shack?\r\n\r\nIn summary, Fallout: New Vegas is like the ultimate road trip through a radioactive wasteland with a backpack full of questionable decisions.

This game is a lot more story driven then Fallout 4 and 76, the story is a lot more crazy but its still a good story. \nThe gun game play is not like newer games so please keep that in mind.  \nThe DLC's in my opinion all of the DLC's is solid even some of the disliked ones by the community they dont give you and bullshit pay stuff or give you busy work to add to your base but give you some new quest, guns and a chance for riches.\nNow the biggest part about fallout NV the mods if there is any problems that you have with this game at all there is a good chance that mods can fix it and that there are like 10 for it. You want whole DLC sized quest mods for NV you got it. You want to make the gun game play better mods.

I really want that someday (Which is impossible cuz Bethesda is one of the worst companys of videogames) make a remaster of this game... Anyway higly recomend playing this instead of Fallout 4 or other games of the Fallout franchise. It has the perfect balance between gameplay and story, as well as good characters and a progression system and real decisions where you really make decisions that will change the world around you, it's simply incredible to see how certain things react to your actions, like the factions for example, my verdict it is a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1736638114, "timestamp_updated": 1736638114,

The character customization is good, and you can build your character in a bunch of different ways. This, along with the 4 different endings makes the game highly re-playable. The graphics aren\u2019t amazing, but this is a game that came out in 2010 and it\u2019s using Bethesda\u2019s old gamebryo engine. Lastly I\u2019ll touch on the combat: the gunplay is improved from fallout 3 because you can aim down sights. It\u2019s still not as great as fallout 4\u2019s, but it works. You\u2019ll be using VATS a lot of the time anyway (a combat system that involves pausing the gameplay and targeting enemies to perform an auto attack) which is pretty fun. There is also good enemy variety which I enjoyed. Overall, this is a \u201cmust play\u201d game.

La historia te \"engancha\" desde el principio, d\u00e1ndote libertad para tomar decisiones que realmente importan. Puedes elegir a qui\u00e9n apoyar, traicionar o incluso controlar todo por tu cuenta, y eso hace que cada partida sea \u00fanica.\r\n\r\nEl mundo abierto est\u00e1 lleno de secretos y personajes interesantes. Siempre hay algo nuevo por descubrir, a pesar de los a\u00f1os el juego se ve bien gr\u00e1ficamente y si le pones un ENB uff. Eso s\u00ed, hay que agregar mods que arreglen algunos bugs, en nexusmods hay demasiada variedad de mods que agregan contenido extra, demasiados buenos.\r\n\r\nSi te gustan los juegos de rol o

You learn that Chomps daughter Melissa is part of the Great Khans and she'll back you up after doing a quest early on when you need to confront Pappa Khan and getting him to break off the Alliance with Caesar's Legion. \r\ni could ramble on more on the quests.

great).\n\nI've already spent 70 hours on this game and I'm pretty sure I won't stop there.\nI really think you should play this game, you'll love it.", "timestamp_created": 1736274596,

E isso significa que ele vale a pena, mesmo que pessoalmente eu tenha me decepcionado. \n\nEu j\u00e1 havia jogado Fallout 1 e Fallout 3, sendo o terceiro um dos jogos mais legais e imersivos que eu j\u00e1 joguei e estava vibrante para este que \u00e9 tido por basicamente toda a comunidade como o melhor Fallout. E eu entendo, ele \u00e9 sempre elogiado como um bom RPG, mas veja s\u00f3, a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 importante para mim e aqui ela n\u00e3o me empolgou.\n\nA trama principal perde todo o mist\u00e9rio quando entendemos o que est\u00e1 acontecendo e sinceramente n\u00e3o acho muito incentivador o que temos pela frente. As side-quests s\u00e3o umas mais sem gra\u00e7a que as outras. Em Fallout 3 t\u00ednhamos tantas side-quests com hist\u00f3rias ricas, dava gosto explorar a Westland, aqui nenhuma me marcou. \n\nEssa coisa de fac\u00e7\u00e3o era tipo trocar o ruim pelo pior, pois temos duas grandes fac\u00e7\u00f5es brigando que s\u00e3o os Ceasars: um bando de psicopata de saia, e os milicos, e francamente eu n\u00e3o suporto milico.\n\nE temos as dlcs, que novamente em Fallout 3 cada uma era extremamente diferente da outra, com sua pr\u00f3pria personalidade e lore, mas aqui... Come\u00e7ando pela queridinha do povo: Lonesome Road \u2014 \u00e9 chata, linear e o antagonista/coadjuvante da hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 um p\u00e9 no saco, tedioso e filosofo de boteco.  \n\nDa\u00ed vamos para Old World Blues, a dlc \"engra\u00e7adinha\" o povo gosta disso s\u00f3 porque os rob\u00f4s fazem piadas sexuais bem bobinhas, pois tem as quests mais irritantes de ir e vir, \u2014 n\u00e3o tem nenhum motivo bom para explorar o mapa al\u00e9m de ir procurar porcarias. Tem umas quests t\u00e3o repetitivas, que eu pensei que estava jogando um MMO. Mas olhe l\u00e1: d\u00e1 umas armas boas...\n\nPara n\u00e3o dizer que tudo era horr\u00edvel, temos Honest Hearts, que \u00e9 uma dlc bacana, nada incr\u00edvel, mas bacana, foi um ar fresco, foi divertido e trouxe uma est\u00e9tica mais selvagem para o jogo, no entanto \u00e9 a mais pequenas de todas.\n\nE por fim Dead Money, a pior coisa do mundo, que dlc lixo. \u00c9 uma expans\u00e3o de Survivor Horror, com tudo poss\u00edvel que vai te irritar. Voc\u00ea tem uma coleira fodida no pesco\u00e7o que explode ao entrar em contato com a sintonia de radios ou alto falantes. Eu tive que usar um mod que era uma pistola que neutralizava essa merda ao ficar clicando no gatilho E MESMO ASSIM ESSA COLEIRA ME IRRITOU MUITO. Eu fico imaginando as centenas de vezes que eu teria morrido se n\u00e3o fosse por esse mod. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 isso, tem uma caralhada de armadilhas, g\u00e1s venenoso e o escambal, a \u00fanica coisa que se salva \u00e9 a hist\u00f3ria que \u00e9 tragica e bonitinha.\n\nEnfim, \u00e9 um dos jogos j\u00e1 feitos. Me entreteve, mas eu ficava esperando um climax que n\u00e3o veio em nenhuma quest, em nada. Eu literalmente cheguei no niv\u00e9l 50 desse jogo, nem em Fallout 3 eu maximizei tudo. A quest final n\u00e3o se compara ao final de Fallout 3, mas que foi bom botar os milicos pra correr foi! \n\nEu queria dar review neutra, mas assim, A MAIORIA AMA ESSE JOGO, ent\u00e3o a sua chance de gostar \u00e9 GRANDE.

solutions.\r\nI sadly found the nevada desert neither very diverse nor the most interesting map to explore, even though it has many interesting locations.\r\nThe desert also gives main story a very slow start, but it then ends too fast once you reach NV and things get going.\r\nIt's honestly a great game, but those few flaws probably don't make it for everyone.\r\nI recommend modding, because of the bugs and old engine.\r\nI also had fun with the DLCs (even the ones considered bad).", "timestamp_created": 1735953644, "timestamp_updated": 1735953644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

M\u00eame apr\u00e8s toutes ces ann\u00e9es, il reste une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour moi.\r\n\r\nCe que j\u2019adore :\r\n-L\u2019\u00e9criture : Les dialogues, les personnages, les factions\u2026 Tout est incroyablement bien \u00e9crit. Chaque choix a des cons\u00e9quences, et on sent vraiment le poids de nos d\u00e9cisions.\r\n-L\u2019ambiance : Le d\u00e9sert du Mojave est fascinant \u00e0 explorer. Les musiques, les lieux, et m\u00eame les petites histoires cach\u00e9es rendent le monde immersif.\r\n-La libert\u00e9 : On peut rejoindre qui on veut, trahir, aider, ou juste se balader en solitaire. C\u2019est toi qui d\u00e9cides de ton aventure.\r\n\r\nLes petits d\u00e9fauts :\r\n-Les bugs : Comme souvent avec les jeux Bethesda/Obsidian, il y a pas mal de bugs. Certains sont dr\u00f4les, d\u2019autres un peu moins\u2026 Mais les mods aident beaucoup \u00e0 corriger \u00e7a.\r\n-Le gameplay : Le syst\u00e8me de combat est un peu rigide, surtout compar\u00e9 \u00e0 des jeux plus r\u00e9cents.

I LOVED the faction system in this game\u2014it\u2019s one of the best features ever implemented in an RPG. The ability to align yourself with different factions, each with its own unique ideologies, goals, and consequences, makes every decision feel impactful and meaningful. It adds so much depth and replayability that no two playthroughs are the same.\n\nThe ammo system was another standout for me. The variety of ammo types, from armor-piercing to hollow-point, added a layer of strategy that I sorely missed in Fallout 4. Being able to adapt your loadout for specific enemies or situations felt incredibly immersive and made combat so much more rewarding. I truly hope future Fallout games bring this feature back\u2014it\u2019s a game-changer.\n\nWhile Fallout 4 was great in its own way, I couldn\u2019t help but wish it had taken more inspiration from New Vegas. The storytelling, the freedom of choice, and the intricate systems in New Vegas set a gold standard for the series. Bethesda, take notes\u2014this is how you do a Fallout game!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t played New Vegas, you\u2019re missing out on one of the most immersive, choice-driven RPGs ever made. It\u2019s a masterpiece that every Fallout fan\u2014and every gamer\u2014should experience.

enjoyed my time with it. I had no knowledge of the game series outside of that specific iteration, which is probably why I was able to look past the glorified chore simulator that fallout 4 is at it's core.\r\n\r\nI was told by my friends that New Vegas is not only the best fallout, but one of the best games of all time. I was really expecting something phenominal; the game only half delivered. The writing, quest design, and story in this game are all great, almost every quest I played had a completely different trajectory depending on the actions I took. The factions had much deeper ideas and flaws than they do in Fo4, and the characters have some pretty remarkable variety. \r\n\r\nHowever, I played this game on an MSI sword 17 with windows 11. The game is incredibly buggy and unstable, and it's essentially unplayable without a host of mods to stabilize it. It took me well over 30 hours before I figured out the combination of mods that worked for me. (NV script extender, 4gb RAM patch, NV anti-crash, plus all the individual components for the just vanilla sprint mod. I installed NVSE and 4GB straight into the game files, and used VortexMods to install the rest.) It's really crummy that bethesda/obsidian won't release compatibility patches to fix their games over time, and instead rely on their players to fix their broken games for them. Also, I found some of the gameplay mechanics in the DLC's to be tedious and overly obnoxious so I didn't spend much time playing them. \r\n\r\nOverall I would reccomend the base game to fans of RPG's, so long as they're comfortable with the idea of modding.", "timestamp_created": 1735680502, "timestamp_updated": 1735680502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

In this game, there are functioning governments that compete with each other, uncompromising their vision for a better world, and the beautiful part of this game is that there is no strictly good or evil option. All these different and conflicting ideologies, and none of them are without merit. In the end, you make the choice who rules over the Mojave.

Gosto do fato de o jogo permitir que voc\u00ea brinque com as possibilidades: decidir quem vive, quem morre, e quando realizar os objetivos X ou Y.\n\nOs companions, mesmo sendo simples e repetindo bastante as falas, s\u00e3o espetaculares e t\u00eam camadas. Isso \u00e9 algo que falta em Skyrim, por exemplo. Al\u00e9m disso, o fato de Fallout: New Vegas n\u00e3o ter quests geradas proceduralmente me deixa muito feliz.\n\nPor\u00e9m, acho o jogo longe de ser perfeito. Ele crasha bastante, a gunplay sem mods \u00e9 horr\u00edvel (e acredite, voc\u00ea vai atirar muito neste jogo), e h\u00e1 outros problemas, como n\u00e3o poder correr de verdade, a IA que frequentemente buga, entre outros. Esses defeitos podem ser resolvidos com mods, mas ningu\u00e9m \u00e9 obrigado a consertar um jogo mal otimizado como Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nAinda assim, se voc\u00ea tiver paci\u00eancia, o jogo pode se tornar bem prazeroso. Em resumo, \u00e9 um jogo muito bom, mas com muitos defeitos. Se voc\u00ea busca uma hist\u00f3ria com um texto impec\u00e1vel, vai encontrar aqui.

What this didn't fix was the insane cursor speed that happens within menus. I don't know why its so fast, and I can't change it. Only in menus, I can play the game just fine.\n\nSecond, I have crashed 6 times. The loading screens are very short so far, which is nice... but when I first launch the game there's a chance I can't get to the menu at all. The game thinks so freaking hard, my CPU is at 100% utilization, and I can't do anything on my PC until it decides It wants to launch or not.\n\nNow actual gameplay... I have seen a vast expanse of desert, with some more desert. I have fought 7 coyotes, something around 8 geckos, 2 wild dogs, and about 1000000000 scorpions. I saw a deathclaw, but it was stuck in the floor and I decided not to try and fight it at level 2. I finally found NPCs outside of the tiny ass town they start you in, after walking around 100 feet of invisible walls... finally found some humans to kill.\n\nI managed to do around 4 quests for what I assume is a faction of criminals, mainly because they were the only people I could find who didn't have one line of dialogue. Finally I get to another town, more NPCs to talk to... only they won't talk. I mean, we had a conversation, but they were all mute. I got the info I needed, and suddenly the NPCs all draw their weapons and start walking really slowly towards the far end of the building. Dunno what that was about, but it looked like a brain worm took over or something. I decided to leave, since the building was boring and hardly anyone had something interesting to say. Big mistake...\n\nI touched the door to exit the building... I stared at the door. I tried to move my cursor... Great, so it froze. I'll go make some tea and come back... maybe it will be fixed. Nope. 20 minutes later because I got side tracked... I had to close the program that claimed it was responding.\n\nSo to summarize... so far I have experienced an utter lack of things to do.\n- The slowest character I have ever played.\n-As far as I can tell... there is no sprint.\n- Mostly invisible walls and empty nothingness\n- Insanely boring dialogue from the pitiful number of NPCs I actually managed to find.\n- Really bad voice acting. Everyone sounds tired and apathetic. Even when they are making threats.\n- Severe stability issues, including weirdly high cursor speeds in the menus.

It stands out as my all-time favorite game without a doubt. The journey from being a simple mail couior to becoming the ruler of the expansive and vibrant wasteland of Vegas is nothing short of exhilarating. The game offers an incredible experience that keeps you engaged and wanting more, making it a true gem in the gaming world.\n\nWhether you choose to align with the NCR or the nefarious Caesar's Legion, the game presents a plethora of activities to immerse yourself in. From confronting drug addicts on the bustling Strip to battling mutated roaches in secluded caves, the variety of quests and encounters is staggering. The freedom to explore and make choices in this richly crafted world feels almost limitless, ensuring that every player can find their own unique adventure.\n\nThe only real drawback I encountered was some difficulty getting the game to run smoothly on Windows 11. However, aside from that minor hiccup, I wholeheartedly recommend Fallout New Vegas to anyone who hasn't yet experienced the Fallout series or an open-world game. Its captivating storytelling and diverse gameplay make it a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nIf the gameplay doesn't quite meet your expectations, which I find hard to believe, this game is still nearly worth buying just to explore its world and enjoy some fantastic music. After all, who can resist the smooth sounds of Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin?\n\n[h1] \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 [/h1] \n[h3] \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc24\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d [/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1735471391, "timestamp_updated": 1735623046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184078890": {"recommendationid": "184078890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072542853", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 245, "playtime_forever": 8097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8097, "last_played": 1735461077}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best RPGs of all time and probably the best game in the Fallout series.

O jogo \u00e9 muito bem otimizado na quest\u00e3o gr\u00e1fica, ent\u00e3o at\u00e9 mesmo um notebook/PC velhinho com placa de v\u00eddeo integrada vai rodar esse jogo com uma boa taxa de quadros. (Joguei a 30 FPS numa Intel HD Graphics 3000 na \u00e9poca)\n\n[h3] Mods usados: [/h3]\n\nO uso de mods \u00e9 basicamente obrigat\u00f3rio. N\u00e3o recomendo a ningu\u00e9m jogar Fallout New Vegas do jeito Vanilla que vem na steam, pois voc\u00ea com certeza vai ter muitos problemas. Os mods que eu usei para melhorar a minha experi\u00eancia est\u00e3o listados logo abaixo:\n\nYukichigai Unofficial Patch - YUP (Corre\u00e7\u00e3o de bugs)\nYukichigai Unofficial Patch - YUP (Portuguese Translation - 13.2) - (Mod para fazer a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o funcionar)\nFallout NV e DLCs PT-BR (Tradu\u00e7\u00e3o)\nNVSE - New Vegas Script Extender (Mod para instalar outros mods)\nNVAC (Anti-Crash)\nFNV 4GB Patcher (Permite que o jogo use at\u00e9 4 GB de RAM. Padr\u00e3o: 2 GB)\nNVTF - New Vegas Tick Fix (Melhora o desempenho e corrige problemas de FPS alto)\nUsing the console doesn't disable achievements (Mod para ganhar conquistas mesmo usando o console do jogo. Explica\u00e7\u00e3o logo abaixo)\n\nObs: 1 - O mod de usar o console n\u00e3o melhora o desempenho do jogo, ele apenas permite que voc\u00ea ganhe conquistas usando o console do jogo (Local para digitar os c\u00f3digos do jogo). Esse mod pode ser \u00fatil, pois eu tive um problema em uma miss\u00e3o em que eu tinha que entregar uma mercadoria para um NPC, s\u00f3 que o NPC estava fora do mapa e eu tive que usar o comando para puxar o NPC para mim, s\u00f3 que eu descobri que ao usar o console, o jogo desativa as conquistas. Esse mod remove essa proibi\u00e7\u00e3o de usar console para ganhar conquistas.\n\n2 - Todos os mods listados acima n\u00e3o adicionam, removem ou alteram nenhum conte\u00fado no jogo. Eles apenas corrigem problemas de desempenho e bugs do jogo, tirando o mod de tradu\u00e7\u00e3o que altera o idioma.\n\n3 - Mesmo usando todos esses mods, eu ainda tive alguns problemas com o jogo. Como por exemplo: 1 corrompimento de save, 2 ou 3 crashes, queda brutas de FPS em alguns momentos e bugs com NPCs.\n\n[h3] Recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es: [/h3]\n\nAntes de jogar Fallout New vegas, \u00e9 recomendado fazer algumas coisas, como por exemplo:\n\n1 - Separar um tempo antes de come\u00e7ar a jogar para instalar os mods.\n2 - Ter em mente que mesmo com mods, o jogo ainda pode apresentar problemas.\n3 - Sempre usar o Quicksave (F5), sempre deixar o auto-save ativado no menu de op\u00e7\u00f5es, nunca salvar o jogo em cima de outro jogo j\u00e1 salvo (Foi assim que meu save corrompeu) e a cada 30 minutos ou 1 hora, salvar o jogo manualmente em um slot novo.\n4 - O console pode corrigir alguns bugs (n\u00e3o todos) como por exemplo o do NPC da minha miss\u00e3o estar fora do mapa.\n\n[h2] Resumo [/h2]\n\nFallout New Vegas \u00e9 um excelente RPG, por\u00e9m o uso de mods \u00e9 basicamente obrigat\u00f3rio devido aos seus in\u00fameros problemas. O jogo tem muita coisa a oferecer e se voc\u00ea ja jogou outros RPGs da Bethesda, como Fallout 3/4, TES Oblivion/Skyrim e curtiu, muito provavelmente voc\u00ea vai gostar de Fallout New Vegas tamb\u00e9m.
