The way events are structured means that you need to participate with existing equipment otherwise its not possible to even deal damage.\r\n\r\nThe PVP aspect of this game is also very unbalanced, with it being mostly a rock,paper, scissor situation. Either that or its just abusing the level system. Either that or its a specific few ships are viable and the rest are essentially worthless for both PVP and PVE. Base attacking is also a boring and abusive system as well, high level ships can bascially outrange a bases defenses and just chip away at health until your base is dead.\r\n\r\nLack of cosmetics is something I never thought I would want, but seeing as how this game has potential for it and NOT having it was a let down. This game had potential but I assume that profits had to take priority over player enjoyment. \r\n\r\nAs for positives, it does a good job of a RTS and base building (IF those systems were balanced out it would feel so much more rewarding) . The lore is easy to follow though most players don't care for it as there is no reward or impact on the game. The art provided unique ship designs that I would like to see remade in future space games. Lastly, the music has aged well, there's a few songs that play while in battle, though again, many players don't care too much for it. This also isn't helped by having those same songs for years without adding any more. Perhaps one day there could be a revival or a successor for this game. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time, have a great day.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736563221, "timestamp_updated": 1736563221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502012073993682861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185291592": {"recommendationid": "185291592", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179255406", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1736545737}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Yo quiero saber quien mas lo  juega ? \ud83d\udd79", "timestamp_created": 1736543633, "timestamp_updated": 1736543633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185075784": {"recommendationid": "185075784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196595946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1737002894}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Nice game, seem's to be like and old rpg game that i had know,of galaxy war's.", "timestamp_created": 1736309881, "timestamp_updated": 1736309881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184761876": {"recommendationid": "184761876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299336439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1736014171}, "language": "english", "review": "Came back for the nostalgia left for mtx and lag.
