Doch das Addon Dark Arisen und die darin enthaltene Insel Finstergram ist so gut konzipiert und durchdacht, dass ich die Atmosph\u00e4re auf die 9 hieven muss.\nDas Spiel l\u00e4uft fl\u00fcssig wobei FPS Drops in h\u00f6herer Aufl\u00f6sung geschehen sind.\n\n[h3]Story 09/10[/h3]\n\nDas Hauptspiel 08/10, Finstergram 10/10.\nIch will hier nicht spoilern die Hauptstory empfaltet sich schwach, im Finale jedoch geht sie steil bergauf.\nWenn Dragons Dogma ohne dem Addon w\u00e4re w\u00fcrde das Spiel schnellstens in Vergessenheit geraten. Aber die Insel Finstergram erz\u00e4hlt so eine epische Story mit einem leidtragenden B\u00f6sewicht das mir die Worte fehlten. Die NPCs wirken alle schlecht geschrieben, das Schauspiel beim Herzog ist so ziemlich B-Movie Trash (auch die bezirzende Herzogin!)\n\u00dcberhaupt wirkt die aufgesetzte Welt so kantig, dass diese wiederum das ganze glaubw\u00fcrdig macht!\n\n[h3]Sound 08/10[/h3]\n\nWenige Soundtracks, der Opener wird nach einer Zeit lame, Finstergram und der letzte Bossfighrt wiederum waren ein Earorgasm.\nNichtsdestotrotz ist das zu wenig. \nDie Dialoge sind daf\u00fcr richtig gut gesprochen. Hier haben wir ein tolles britisches Englisch welches gut in Szene gesetzt ist.\nSchade das die japanischen Stimmen die bei der PS3 dabei waren nicht in der Steam Version inkludiert sind. \n\n[h3]Content 10/10[/h3]\n\nFinstergram... Mehr sage ich nicht dazu, der  Gameplayloop dort hat mich solange im Bann gezogen, immer ein besseren Dolch immer ein besseren Bogen, dann Drachen gepr\u00e4gt und und und... \nDer Speicherstand sagt 130 Stunden davon sind 80 Stunden nur in den einen Mega Dungeon gemacht worden!\n\n[h3]Zusammenfassung 09/10[/h3]\n\nDas Hauptspiel w\u00fcrde bei mir eine schwache 8/10 bekommen, da kann auch das ausgezeichnete Gameplay nicht viel retten.\nFinstergram jedoch ist und war eine Offenbarung. Selten hat mich ein Spiel durch sein Addon so \u00fcberzeugen k\u00f6nnen, so f\u00e4rbte das Addon auch auf das Hauptspiel ab,\nden der Lore wird in Finstergram um einige Anekdoten dazu erz\u00e4hlt was der es schon tollen am Ende erz\u00e4hlten Story des Hauptspiels eine zus\u00e4tzliche Gewichtung beisteuert.\n\nF\u00fcr mich ist das Spiel eine tolle Erfahrung und ich glaub dass ich in Zukunft noch einen Durchgang einplanen werde, denn ich bin der [b]Erweckte![/b] :-)", "timestamp_created": 1737360335, "timestamp_updated": 1737360512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "185994646": {"recommendationid": "185994646", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973019975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 4483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1068, "playtime_at_review": 4483, "last_played": 1737348360}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1737348578, "timestamp_updated": 1737348578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185988678": {"recommendationid": "185988678", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179775728", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2709, "playtime_at_review": 8987, "last_played": 1737337021}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "bom", "timestamp_created": 1737340488, "timestamp_updated": 1737340488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185980932": {"recommendationid": "185980932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991414136", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 374, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1737229247}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00e9 daora", "timestamp_created": 1737330580, "timestamp_updated": 1737330580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185965996": {"recommendationid": "185965996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263318867", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1737314837}, "language": "czech", "review": "Je to fakt hrozn\u00e1 hra.

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2873, "playtime_at_review": 12141, "last_played": 1737406611}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this game a lot at this point and I honestly cant recommend it.\r\n\r\nI cant explain how much potential this game has. When this game is functioning as I feel like it was intended to function, its one of the best RPG's ever made, the thing is, it almost never felt like that. The promise of unparalleled RPG gameplay is what had me coming back every single time, but it was just never quite there. \r\n\r\nThe story was boring and unsatisfying, and thats pretty wild since if you write it down on paper the story sounds completely unhinged, and like a good time but its not. The stakes were never adequately explained and pretty much no time or quests were dedicated to developing the relationships to ground my character in the world at all. In the first few minutes I'm playing a dude on his way to fight the dragon, I dont know this guy or the context of the fight and before I can really understand whats going on, I'm now a different character who has their heart stolen by a dragon. The consequences of not having a heart dont seem to be too dire since my character wakes up the next day with a scar but no other issues. So after some obligatory quests for the duke, the dragon comes back to ask why youre taking so long, steals my beloved ( I didnt even know there was a romance system in the game) and makes me fight him. A couple of minutes after the fight the city explodes, you fight a different dragon and then fight God who is inexplicably easier to kill than most enemies in the game and then kill yourself........ what?!?!\r\n\r\nThe game has a lot of really cool combat and AI mechanics but theyre really poorly explained. For example I knew you could grapple small enemies and objects but I didn\u2019t  know I could climb enemies for the first half of my playthrough and thats a pretty significant ability in combat. \r\n\r\nThe enemies are really well designed but the variety is pretty weak. Its not that there isnt variety available either, its just that the game doesn\u2019t employ any of the enemies it has. For instance in the overworld, for most of the game the only large monsters or bosses available for you to fight are one drake, and like 15 giants and chimeras. Meanwhile in the first few minutes of the game they had you fight a hydra, but didn\u2019t let you kill it and you never see another hydra until one specific spot in the post dragon world, there\u2019s also a griffin, (who shows up like once for you to fight and the rest of the time he's just flying overhead and nearly impossible to aggro), 3 additional types of wyverns, super giant saurians, skeleton mages, giant hellhounds, additional giant variants, and the freaking beholders from DnD. and for some reason each of these only gets used around one time each in the main game. \r\n\r\nProgression is weird too. You have like 3 avenues of progression, those being character level, gear power, and class level. Character level functions as expected, its a straight forward increase to power, correspondent with the exp gained from combat and quests. Gear power is weird though. The starting gear isnt bad..... its usable even into the late game if you upgrade it. The really weird thing is that theres no real compelling reason to change gear as you progress. Everything seems to be about equal for the majority of the campaign, at least until you kill the dragon the first time which is like 70% of the way through the game. Class level is also weird since its pretty easy to max a class within a few hours of fighting general enemies. After the class is maxed your only additional power increases come from certain accessories which can augment your skills and your character level. All of this together makes the power scaling in this game lurch around very inconsistently. You are extremely weak at the start as both your class and character level are both 1 and you have next to no skills. Then you suddenly spike in power as your class maxes out but thats like one third of the way through the story so for the rest of the time your power is pretty much static, in fact it feels like you get weaker as you get into the late game since the enemies are getting stronger while you stay relatively the same.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to discuss the enemy difficulty. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. Enemy difficulty seems to bounce between being damn near impossible to kill and one shot kills. This makes the game feel boring most of the time since killing one shot kill enemies feels pointless and grinding through an HP bar thicker than the earth's crust is just an exercise in frustration. This becomes most prevalent on Bitter black Isle. For example, I fought the second to last boss of bitter black isle (the blue glowing suit of armor) twice, The first time I fought it I beat it in about 5-10 minutes. Not a very hard fight. I left to go get additional healing items for the fight against the final boss but when I came back the boss had respawned. The second time I faced it, I used the same gear, same pawns and the same skills but it just refused to take any damage. I still won since its move set is easily dodgeable but grinding through its HP took me nearly an hour.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this the game has several bugs which can lead to additional frustration. The most irritating bug I've run into is that certain drakes upon reaching very low health will fly away and bounce in the ocean, out of reach of my bow and my pawn's magic. Whats worse is that its a pretty common bug for the drake north of gran soren.\r\n\r\nOn paper I should love everything about this game, it has massive amounts of potential and depth but the execution this time around is just too poor for me to recommend.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1737103794, "timestamp_updated": 1737103794, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185765414": {"recommendationid": "185765414", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113776712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1689, "last_played": 1702851641}, "language": "english", "review": "shit is fire im like lvl 900 just with a bug", "timestamp_created": 1737097917, "timestamp_updated": 1737097917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185734180": {"recommendationid": "185734180", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039128190", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1989, "playtime_at_review": 1477, "last_played": 1737156066}, "language": "turkish", "review": "daha 700 800 km yol gidecem yayan", "timestamp_created": 1737057642, "timestamp_updated": 1737159062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185731949": {"recommendationid": "185731949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801201335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3042, "last_played": 1714925189}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, just the game I was looking for ages, although there are many things I could criticize it for but the combat and exploration is the greatest.

I may have given this a \"meh\" rating if available, but I feel like I need to try bring balance to the Very Positive reviews here.\n\nI felt so disengaged playing this game and it took me a long while to figure out why.  For me, the silent protagonist is a big problem.  You have no agency AND you are literally silent.  I cannot even inject my own personality onto this hero as he looks upon events with a slight frown or exaggerated shock.  You just sit back and watch yourself being tossed from pillar to post.  This made it very difficult to engage with the main story.  The Pawns are a huge part of this world, yet you don't even get much from the relationship with your own Pawn.  At least throw me some exposition so I can get into the lore of the world.\n\nThe side quests are equally disengaging with a lot of fetch and escort quests.  And oh boy, is it a lot of travelling, all on foot with that stamina meter ticking down - take a lot of mushrooms, wherever you go.  Yes, you get \"Port Crystals\" which you can place strategically, but better fast travel would've been very much welcomed.\nThere's a quest where you need to find some evidence and there's a quest marker on the opposite side of the map.  I didn't have any Port Crystals that side, so travelled by foot only to find that the quest marker is the EXACT same NPC that's in the main town, offering the same stuff (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n\nThe combat starts off enjoyable, but as you become more powerful, the combat becomes repetitive, especially as you encounter the same enemies over and over.  Even the once challenging chimera becomes a mere pest to farm for materials.  I'm not sure I want to switch up vocations again, but it may be the best way to make the combat feel fresh again.  You could probably master all vocations in one play through.\n\nI cannot excuse the UI just because it was released in 2012.  The UI is dreadful. There is no keybind for the map, something you frequently need to look at - you have to open up the pause menu, then go to Map.  This is also where you access the Quests and Equipment section, which is different from the inventory for some reason \ud83d\ude48\nMaking Curatives or Tools is a pain as you have to select the correct ingredient to combine with others, instead of having a separate Crafting menu where you could select the item you want to create and seeing if you have the appropriate ingredients.\n\nI'm still going to finish the game, maybe just for the noddy badge.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736838120, "timestamp_updated": 1736838120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456063598394393921", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185519673": {"recommendationid": "185519673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197509483", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1703965971}, "language": "english", "review": "One of best games \nFan od dragon dovma", "timestamp_created": 1736784621, "timestamp_updated": 1736784621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185517687": {"recommendationid": "185517687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139779484", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 199, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 287, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1736781254}, "language": "english", "review": "So I was in this dungeon and I had to descend to its depths for the mission.

And also one of the most flawed games, making it often difficult to recommend to my friends without adding a list of \"buts\".\r\n\r\nI don't think I can praise Dragon's Dogma combat enough, it's a nearly perfect experience in my opinion. It was always punchy, spectacular and interactive. And it never got stale thanks to the very versatile vocation system, allowing you to easily change classes and try different playstyles. Not to mention your character's height and weight play a role in it as well. \r\n\r\nI also loved the Pawn system, allowing you to use other players' pawns, each with their own personality and accumulated knowledge used to help you in your journey. Other players can also hire your pawn, granting it experience and ratings upon return. I could easily write a whole essay on this system alone because it's so impressive, and it's essential to the Dragon's Dogma experience. It's central even to the main narrative.\r\n\r\nWhile I really liked the game's story and grounded medieval fantasy vibe, there's a lot to complain about as well. I absolutely hated the amount of escort and fetch quests from numerous notice boards. The UI is horrible in communicating game's systems and essential information, very frustrating to use. Dragon's Dogma travel system is very divisive, some claiming it's immersive, others claiming it's outdated and overly limiting. I'm somewhere in between. And I didn't like the fact that we can only have a single save file that overwrites itself.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Dragon's Dogma such a unique experience is a blend of well designed and thought-through systems and mechanics, which result in a very satisfying gameplay loop. But mix in a certain amount of jank and questionable and outdated design decisions, and you'll get a very interesting roller-coaster of impressions. In my case, the positives were so overwhelming, I could easily look past many of the annoyances. But it won't work for everyone.\r\n\r\n[h3][b]What I liked[/b][/h3] \r\n\ud83d\udfe2 Incredible combat experience\r\n\ud83d\udfe2 Fascinating Pawn system unique to Dragon's Dogma\r\n\ud83d\udfe2 Wide variety of well designed Vocations\r\n\r\n[h3][b]What I didn't like[/b][/h3] \r\n\ud83d\udfe0 Not all game systems are well explained\r\n\ud83d\udfe0 UI design can be frustrating in many cases\r\n\ud83d\udfe0 Escort missions\r\n\r\n[h3][b]My score[/b][/h3]\r\n[b]8.7 / 10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1736194382, "timestamp_updated": 1736194382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184926989": {"recommendationid": "184926989", "author": {"steamid": "76561199252701750", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1736168983}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b80\u76f4\u53cd\u4eba\u7c7b,\u4e0d\u662f\u4eba\u73a9\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1736169054, "timestamp_updated": 1736169054, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49701458215713501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184911750": {"recommendationid": "184911750", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021921144", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5617, "last_played": 1736156585}, "language": "czech", "review": "Skv\u011blej p\u0159\u00edb\u011bh, n\u011bkolik konc\u016f, ale cestov\u00e1n\u00ed je zdlouhav\u00fd", "timestamp_created": 1736156649, "timestamp_updated": 1736156649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184902477": {"recommendationid": "184902477", "author": {"steamid": "76561199438981026", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 1740, "last_played": 1737392411}, "language": "english", "review": "Dragon\u2019s Dogma is a total hidden gem.

The most engaging thing about hiring a pawn is finding one with a silly outfit....\n3) Combat is.. fine? I ended up spamming the same buttons and hacking away at enemies with little joy. Sure... you need to target larger enemies in certain areas and hit boxes.. but the joy of that fades as you tackle the same monsters over. and over. and over. and over.\n\nI will say: There is something comforting about loading up an old RPG and grinding away in same-looking dungeons and enemies. I found that I would load up the game while talking on the phone with friends, watching TV, or while engaging in something else.\n\n I don't have the nostalgia for this game to buoy me through the experience of playing it in 2024.

The early levels are a real struggle and a total bore, but it does pick up later on. Another thing that picked up in the lategame was movement, at least if you're playing assassin. I liked short-distance traversal in this game very much, very ARPG-esque, although I hated how slow stamina regens even OOC, that's a QOL feature that probably some mod out there can provide, and I highly recommend new players to look into it as well as some mod that reworks autosaving in this game. If you don't have any issues with remembering to save before every serious encounter and on the whole every so often, then you won't have many problems. If you are a bit forgetful, like me, then you might lose 30 minutes of running and walking to a quest location to a random griffin or chimera slapping you on the cheek for skipping every possible line of dialogue in the city.\n\nThe monsters are very good. The last dragon fight was super climactic. Overall the enemies are outstandingly designed, you actually have to adapt to beat the mobs and bosses (bruteforcing is possible but completely not worth it). It was my first game where you have a mechanic which lets you climb your enemies, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nAnother great aspect of the game is the worldspace, landscapes, whatever. The locations felt very atmospheric and the dungeons/instances were designed so that a player such as me who likes to explore every nook and cranny gets rewarded for looking. They missed the mark with Gran Soren's portcrystal placement tho, why not put it near the fountain. I loved the starting location, especially the music in it. Whenever I came back to it I felt I'm being reminded why the MC is setting out on the journey, it's very iconic. The entrance to Bitterblack Isle and the whole location looked really cool as well, kind of reminded me of Dark Souls.\n\nNow on to the bad things...What a clusterfuck of a story. The only good thing about it is probably Grigori. I really hate when games make dialogue using old english, gibberish and riddles. Half the time characters say smth I can't understand what they're talking about. On topic of characters, there's not really many I found to be likeable. Every time something interesting happened with one of the characters they would be immidiately put on a shelf and left there to rot like the carrots and apples in your inventory. For example [spoiler] one of the most memorable moments in this game for me was the quest where you had to find Selene after some peasants raided her house. That was the moment when the game reveals that pawns with time (or the death of their master I guess) take on the liking of their masters and live as humans. Selene was one such pawn, and I felt that she had some bigger role to play in this story or at least that I would see some more of her. But no, after that she only appeared at the literal last cutscene of the game. Similar thing with Mercedes and the Dragonforged. [/spoiler]\nI was especially displeased with whom the game considered to be my \"beloved\", which sucked balls [spoiler] as I really wanted to fight the dragon and was unsure if I made the choice to sacrifice them I could still fight him [/spoiler]. Other then that, the game could have benefited so much if it gave the player at least some choices to make, not only at the literal last mission but along the way as well. Some quests felt like they would have consequences on the gameplay (e.g [spoiler]the affair with the duchess[/spoiler]) but had practically none.\n\nI also hated how much time you had to spend i menu's and micromanage your characters load. I had no clue it was tied to character creation, I'm almost sure the game doesn't say it. I can't really put my finger around it but something felt off with consumable items in this game, like I never got accustomed to how you craft stuff and what was best to keep in your eq. It also felt extremely bad when I gave some of the pots to my pawns and they immidiately use all panaceas on being drenched in water or poisoned by a snake.\n\nThe way pawns work also kind of sucks. Sometimes they would carry the fight and do exactly what I would want them to but they would also be as much of a hindrance at other times. They are also soooooo annoying with their constant yapping.

I do love the Pawn mechanic and the customizability of your own character and that of your own companion. The leveling is slow paced and grindy with some areas taking overly long. What I enjoyed most was the layering of armour pieces that made the game feel historically accurate in a medieval setting.\r\n\r\n[b][u] VISUALS - 6/10[/u][/b]\r\nYou can feel the age of some of these visuals and I must say, many of the monsters are not that visually impressive except for a rare few (like Damon & Death in the DLC).\r\n\r\n[b][u] MUSIC - 7/10[/u][/b]\r\nThe score is fine, nothing special or dramatic to point out.

I need to tell you about this hidden gem called Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.  It was a gift from a friend \u2013 one of those \"trust me, you'll love it\" kind of deals. And let me tell you, my friend was right. I'm completely hooked!\n\nThis game is a unique blend of action RPG and open-world exploration, with a combat system that's both challenging and incredibly satisfying.  It's got this old-school vibe that reminds me of classic RPGs, but with modern gameplay mechanics that keep things fresh.\n\nHere's what makes Dragon's Dogma so special:\n\n* **The Pawn System:** This is where the game truly shines. You create your own main character, but you also get to design a \"pawn\" \u2013 a loyal AI companion who fights alongside you.  But here's the cool part: other players can borrow your pawn, and you can borrow theirs. It's like having a constantly evolving party with unique skills and abilities.\n\n* **Epic Battles with Giant Creatures:**  Get ready to face off against griffins, cyclopes, hydras, and even dragons!  The combat is fast-paced and visceral, requiring you to climb onto these behemoths and attack their weak points. It's intense, strategic, and incredibly rewarding when you finally take down one of these beasts.\n\n* **A World Ripe for Exploration:**  Gransys is a vast and beautiful world filled with hidden secrets, challenging dungeons, and breathtaking vistas.  You'll explore ancient ruins, climb treacherous mountains, and delve into dark caverns.  And with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system, the world feels truly alive.\n\n* **Deep Character Customization:**  You can create your character from scratch, choosing from a variety of vocations (classes) that determine your skills and playstyle.  Want to be a magic-wielding sorcerer? A heavily armored warrior? A nimble assassin?  The choice is yours, and you can even switch vocations later in the game.\n\n* **Dark Arisen Expansion:**  This edition includes the massive Dark Arisen expansion, which adds a whole new island to explore, filled with even tougher enemies and more powerful loot. It's a challenging endgame experience that will put your skills to the test.\n\nIf you're looking for an RPG with a unique combat system, a captivating world, and a deep sense of adventure, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a must-play.  It's one of those games that grabs you and doesn't let go.

Es el reto perfecto para jugadores veteranos en busca de emoci\u00f3n extra.\r\n\r\nASPECTOS A CONSIDERAR: El juego no es perfecto. Los gr\u00e1ficos muestran su edad en algunos aspectos. A\u00fan as\u00ed son encantadores en dise\u00f1o y tiene buen sonido. Al comienzo, pareciera que el sistema de viaje r\u00e1pido puede ser limitado, hasta que vas desbloqueando ciertos objetos.

Antes de ir a la isla Bitterblack aseg\u00farate de tener poder, ya que encontrar\u00e1s enemigos muy desafiantes que te ayudar\u00e1n a farmear hasta el LV200. Divi\u00e9rtete!!\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Es un RPG imprescindible para los amantes de los desaf\u00edos, la exploraci\u00f3n y los combates \u00e9picos. Aunque pueda tener algunos bordes \u00e1speros, su coraz\u00f3n late con una intensidad que pocos juegos logran igualar. Cada batalla, cada descubrimiento y cada decisi\u00f3n en este mundo deja huella.\r\n\r\n\u00bfLo recomiendo? Absolutamente.
