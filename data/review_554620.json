As a teenager, I literally admired the atmosphere and soundtracks of the game, as well as its plot to some extent. The way the authors were able to press on the emotions of me as a teenager is truly commendable. Even after going through the first part again as adult, some part of my soul responded to me, although some moments already seemed rather stupid. And yet, these mistakes could be forgiven.\nAfter completing this part of the series, I only had one wish - that the game Life is Strange: Before the Storm never, NEVER existed.\nYou may disagree with me. And you have the right to do so. Everything said below is just my opinion.\nI will indicate what I generally liked: the general atmosphere, soundtracks, graphics are generally pleasant too.\n[h3](!) There are spoilers below![/h3]\n[hr][/hr]\nMy English is not perfect, so if you see any incorrect moments here, I apologize. I tried to express my thoughts as clearly as possible.\nSo, my main complaint about this game is Rachel. You know, in the first part of the game, she was presented to us as an \"angel\", as the most holy and innocent person in this world, as an understanding and kind friend, whom everyone, literally EVERYONE adored. The fact that she died was really very sad and shocked many - after all, the star of the college was gone. Yes, there were moments of hatred towards her. However, they were so few that it seemed as if she was an ideal and beloved character.\nRachel in this part is a selfish, childish, absolutely irresponsible, manipulative and insensitive character. A typical Mary Sue.\nLiterally from the very first seconds of meeting Chloe, she begins to put pressure on her, manipulate her as she wants, while Chloe herself, desperately needing a friend, succumbs to this. Chloe literally falls in love with this character. And I sincerely wondered how such a disgusting character can be loved.\nYou will say: hey, but they are 16 years old and they are still children! Everyone behaves like that at that age - it's normal! And I'll tell you: the way this character behaved is not normal. Rachel knew what she was doing. She knew how to put pressure on Chloe. She knew that Chloe would be dependent on her and would run after her like a devoted dog.\nAnd in this case, Chloe was always blamed for everything, literally EVERYTHING, even when it turned out that Rachel was actually to blame for something that happened. Chloe was just a scapegoat, and Rachel is always a saint.\nThe way she put pressure on Chloe when she expressed indecision about leaving their hometown disgusted me. Rachel did not think about the possibility of restoring the family, did not think that perhaps Chloe would want to restore the family, no. Everything is bad for her - therefore everything is bad for everyone.\nThe moment when Chloe tried to show sympathy and support also caused sincere anger in me. If you remember, Chloe tried to give Rachel a bat at the junkyard to let out her anger. What did this girl do? She was rude to her. That's all you need to know about this character. [spoiler]An ungrateful piece of sh*t.[/spoiler]\nSpeaking about restoring the family - if in the first part David was presented to us as a bad character, then in this part I will argue with it. He really tried to help, he tried to be a good stepfather. The only thing is that he, as well as Joyce and Chloe, needed the help of a professional therapist. He really tried, although with very questionable methods at times, yes. However, I still believe that no one in the family tried to understand each other - this is mainly why conflicts arose.\nChloe is going through a difficult period in her life - the departure of her biological father, whom she loved, who was a part of her life. Her rebellion, her desire to express herself and the desire to let out all her pain and sadness can be understood - I think each of us experienced similar feelings. For a teenager, it is especially painful. And in this state, we are always the most vulnerable. And if in the first part Chloe was rude and even rebellious for some, then here we can understand that she is, in fact, a good person, but she need a help (and certainly not in the form of Rachel, who is pushing her to self-destruction). It's just that no one tries to understand how much pain she is in, not even her own mother. Don't get me wrong, I don't sympathize with Chloe completely - she is just as irresponsible and infantile too. But I can understand why she behaves so rebelliously.\nOh yeah, and for some reason the writers of \"Before the Storm\" decided to completely ignore the relationship between Rachel and Frank. They literally behave like strangers with each other, although in the first part they were described as those who have romantic feelings between them. And here is... Nothing? Just - wtf?\nI could go on and on about what kind of character Rachel was made into, but that would take too much time. All I will say is that when she died at thr end of this game, I didn't feel sorry for her. I really felt sorry for her when the fact of her death was shown in the first \"Life is Strange\" part. However, this version of this character did not cause any emotions in me at all, except disappointment and anger. This is such an annoying character (even worse than Chloe, which is surprising) All the things she did to Chloe, the way she acted like a hysteric and a manipulator, can't evoke sympathy. Believe me, I tried.\nThis part basically came out pretty crumpled and even more illogical than the first. Conflicts in some situations just arise out of nowhere and I really wish \"Before the Storm\" had never existed. The developers of this part, apparently, did not understand at all what exactly made the first part so successful. Oh, and I haven't even touched on the plot itself - it also seemed too strange to me. If in the first part the authors tried to reveal other characters as best as possible, then here all we see is the authors' cheap attempts to reach that level. We can talk about this for so long that I'm afraid one review won't be enough.\nHonestly, I would rather just ignore this part of the series. And the fact that the authors made a remaster, but did not change the main plot to a more logical one at least at the level of the first \"Life is Strange\" sincerely upsets me.\n[hr][/hr]\nI really wish I could recommend this game to others. But I just can't. This part was a slap in the face for me as a fan of the first part.

Im Vergleich mit dem Hauptspiel verliert es deutlich, ist aber immer noch gut.", "timestamp_created": 1735128181, "timestamp_updated": 1735128181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183593204": {"recommendationid": "183593204", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175642281", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 822, "last_played": 1735902211}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u5230\u6700\u540e\u7a81\u7136\u54ed\u4e86\uff0c\u524d\u4f20\u867d\u7136\u6bd4\u672c\u4f53\u5dee\u592a\u591a\uff0c\u4f46RC\u8865\u7684\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u518d\u6709MCR\u8fd9\u79cd\u4eba\u7269\u8ba9\u6211\u54ed\u6210\u8fd9\u6837\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1735069680, "timestamp_updated": 1735069680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183568640": {"recommendationid": "183568640", "author": {"steamid": "76561199763240498", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 445, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1736802309}, "language": "english", "review": "My first impression of before the storm was that it was a unique and beautiful game and i still think so. The characters are so relatable and have so much depth and complexity. I am absolutely  in love with the soundtrack as i have been listening to it non-stop for the past weeks, although i am a sucker for the occasional montage. I was completely hooked While playing this as it wonderfully portrays loss and the seemingly mundane life of a teenager. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the scenes, its was a lot more exciting then i first expected. However, It is a bit boring to replay and the achievements are fairly easy to get. I still love this game though and i recommend playing it before trying out the original Life is Strange. Overall its a great game!!!", "timestamp_created": 1735049238, "timestamp_updated": 1736029275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 34618, "total_negative": 2492, "total_reviews": 37110}, "cursors": {"AoJwkNnBoJMDcJiJrAU=": "Mon Jan 20 19:32:20 2025"}}
