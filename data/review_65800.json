lot of time with my old online friends just playing Hall of Heroes PVP with our modded weapons screaming gleefully at each other. However, I also think that gives me the perfect perspective to give a recommendation because I'm a lot older now and somehow still get the same enjoyment out of playing this game for hours on end trying to get a new high score on a map, or finding the perfect choke points to help me get a win I otherwise couldn't have gotten. I am not a tower defense kind of guy, I usually stick to single player games with rich stories but even this game has a lot of detail, especially in the maps. The atmosphere changes with each map, and the coziness of the Tavern is the cherry on top. The graphics aren't crazy but as long as I can see the love and soul while playing, that's okay with me. You will find references and even pictures of the Devs all over the game, which is not something you usually see. The love this game was made with is evident in every hour you spend playing.\n\nThis game does excel at being a co-op title, but you can still play through and enjoy the hell out of the entirety of this game by yourself. The game allows you to create as many characters as you want, basically letting you have every hero maxed out if you wanted to, even duplicate heroes with different stats allowing for a different play style. This means that you can use any combination of traps and defense on any map allowing infinite replay ability. The maps in this game? There's a few boring ones don't get me wrong, but majority of them are a blast to play. If you have a few friends willing to throw 8 bucks at the game + all dlc when on sale, the experience is even more amplified on higher difficulties. Seeing those numbers get higher and higher, being able to go toe to toe with an ogre on nightmare and ruthless is an achievement in and of itself once you go through the leveling up experience. If you like God Tier rolls on equipment with different numbers and amplifiers, this game will get you hooked on picking up every single piece of loot you see.\n\nI highly advise wish listing and waiting til the game goes on sale. 8 bucks for the game and all DLC is a steal considering the game has 100+ hours worth of content. In the end, I believe this is the greatest Tower Defense game of all time. I don't know what makes a great tower defense game cause this is the only TD game I'll ever play.", "timestamp_created": 1736103615, "timestamp_updated": 1736114819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184847012": {"recommendationid": "184847012", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013409870", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1593, "last_played": 1735471511}, "language": "english", "review": "Dark Souls 2: Better.\n\nAs much as Dungeon Defenders 1 succeeds in providing an entertaining experience, it pales in comparison to Dark Souls 2.
