Whomever wrote the closing arcs completely destroyed the narrative and characters. Riddled with bugs and horrendous excuses for case questions. 50% of the time I'm choosing between Truth, Doubt, or Lie, I'm literally unsure of what the question was, because the two characters had 4 more lines of dialogue between the prompt and having to produce evidence. Sometimes the entire framing of the question will change in these couple of lines, leading to an entirely different dialogue path. Basic example: \r\n\r\n\"I think you were at the place. LIAR!\"\r\n\"You can't prove that I stole the monkey!\"\r\n\"Of course I can, it was orange!\"\r\n\"But I'm not orange, so how can that be?\"\r\n\r\nMe: .... What the fuck am I even asking this guy? Am I still asking about him being at the location, or whether he stole the monkey? What the heck are they on about with the color orange??? \r\n\r\n> Looks at super long evidence list with no clue whatsoever.\r\n> Backs out of accusation and hits \"doubt\" because that 50/50 is better than trying to pick a piece of evidence for a question I don't understand.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, they totally ruined the characters for absolutely no reason. You know how bad writers think it's fun to include stupid interpersonal conflict as a means to create tension? Yeah.

Those accounts used email addresses that have been since shutdown. I am one of those people with Verizon shutting down their email servers in 2017.\r\n\r\nRockstar has also slashed their support team.  There is no longer the possible to have a live chat with a support team member. Instead your email will get read by a random person every time, they will ask insanely specific and robotic questions like when was the exact date the Rockstar Social Account was made. When was it linked to steam? There are no records for these events to possibly give them the right answer. The team members aren\u2019t even coordinated because one of them stated that they don\u2019t expect exact dates for these questions. Yet the next question they asked, they wanted exact dates. For now, Rockstar Social has closed my tickets without recovering the account back to me stating the issue was \u201csolved\u201d \r\n\r\nTheir text prompt questions couldn't even handle that RDR2 and GTAV were both gifts, and asked more than once to send them receipts of the game from the credit card company in my own personal email inbox even after showing them they were gifts.

I don't usually write reviews but I felt this game is very deserving of one. Here are some of my observations.\r\n\r\n+ This game has the best voice acting of any game I have ever played. Note that I said \"the best\" and not \"one of the best\". This is subjective of course, but I think Rockstar really did a tremendous job here. \r\n+ very real and relatable characters, not the overexaggerated Trevor Philips type from GTA 5. The main character has a background story that unfolds throughout the game. He is not a superman of any sort which makes him very relatable. \r\n+ The mission design is very enjoyable and the cases have been crafted with lots of love to detail. Every case feels different and is a new challenge. Similar to GTA there are some quick missions, side missions as well as the main campaign, so mission time varies, which I love. \r\n+ The game has a beautiful post WW2 atmosphere. Characters, buildings, streets, car radio music, some old-fashioned use of language and expressions, all of that contributes to the 1940s feeling.\r\n+ The cases have on occasion be challenging for me because my short-term memory is pretty bad and I have trouble remembering names and associating names with faces and events. For every case, new characters are introduced, and I have sometimes found in tricky to follow the plot. But I have the same issues when watching movies or TV shows. and this game is a fun way to challenge myself to focus on a case and try to understand what's going on. I guess that's real detective work anyway after all, so it adds to the immersion for me. \r\n\r\nEven though it has been quite a few years after its release, this game is still very enjoyable and well worth the money, especially when on sale. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the frame rates are limited to 30 FPS by default which may not result in a pleasant gaming experience for everyone. However, there are patches out there that unlock the frame rate, thus resulting in much more fluid gameplay.

Noire, which is apparently impressive because the achievement for beating the game has about a 10% completion rate. That's my credibility here.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? No. There are better detective games out there, better third person shooters, and games with much better stories. Plus, there's a lot of stuff to talk about external to the game that I want to lay out here, about the developers of the game, and the publisher.\n\nBut I'll talk about the game first.\n\nL.A. Noire is a third person game where you walk around and interact with stuff in the environment. Doing so usually adds a clue to your collection. Actually making progress generally involves then taking your assembled clues and interviewing a 'person of interest'.\n\nHere's where the problems start.\n\nL.A. Noire uses a technology known as 'MotionScan' to capture basically 3D video of people's faces so they can put them into the game. Now, this might sound pretty cool, but if you ever boot this game up today you will find pretty quickly that this was a pretty limited technology. It only works at 30fps so the game is locked to that framerate, and while the effect works somewhat well on some of the more prominent main characters, you will notice that it rapidly becomes almost horrifying when you see some of the faces on some side characters. Evidence of cut corners and rushed production.\n\nI have a feeling there was another limitation, where, no one could ever have their hair down, because EVERY single character in this game wears their hair as short as is possible, and it becomes extremely noticeable when you see that every single female character in particular, is wearing their hair in a bun as tight and close to their scalp as possible. If you look at the box art for L.A. Noire you will notice there's a blonde woman wearing her hair down, and if you don't know anything about the game you probably think oh, she's some sort of femme fatale, a typical character type for a 'noir' game. \n\nExcept that character is not found anywhere in this game. She's not a character, she's just on the box art. Anyway, let me get back to the gameplay here, because it ties in with MotionScan.\n\nWhen doing an interview, which as mentioned is how you progress in this game, you get 3 options after asking a question: Truth, Doubt or Lie. Now, the game does a terrible job of explaining what these are but basically it means you have the option of essentially asking them to continue speaking, via Truth - which accepts their statement to get a calm reasonable explanation from them - or you pick Doubt, to Doubt their statement and to play the conversation harder, usually threatening them for information. 'Lie' means you call them out as a liar because you have hard evidence.\n\nOh, also you only get ONE shot by the way. You get ONE CHANCE to pick correctly, if you fail, that question is removed and marked with an X because you failed and you are forced to move on.\n\nThe problem is... you can sort of intuit which option you're meant to select, but because there are two 'call them out on their lies' options (Doubt & Lie), you often face a dilemma where, you KNOW they are hiding something but you're not sure which way to approach it. This, finally is where MotionScan comes in - the idea was, and the conceit of the game, is that you yourself are meant to look at their face and just intuit what's behind their expression. \n\nHowever, it is ONLY useful if they lie really effectively. Almost no one lies effectively in this game, and when they do they always make a bizarrely overacted facial expression to show you they are hiding something.\n\nThere's other problems.\n\nSo for example if you say \"Where were you last night?\" and then they say \"I was at home, sir\" then make a shifty face, you might have both evidence they were NOT at home, while also being able to intuit it from their expression. So which do you pick? Doubt, or Lie? I should note here, to be clear, that this game only wants 1 answer. Sometimes even if you have evidence to catch them out, selecting Lie simply won't work - you have to pick Doubt. And the opposite is also true - if the game wants you to select Lie, then you usually can't use Doubt. It just won't work.\n\nThis puts you in situations where, you KNOW the guy is hiding something but you don't know which option to pick. So what do you do? There's nothing for it but to look up a walkthrough - or do what I did which was very tedious, which is run through the conversation, fail, then restart from checkpoint and try again over and over until I got it right.\n\nThis for me was one of the big things that completely killed most of the enjoyment of the game, because L.A. Noire, interestingly, is a game where it doesn't really care if you complete the case rightly or not. So you can progress through the game, while basically failing most things in the case. Failing however, means you often just don't get to solve the mystery, and that sucks.\n\nThe writing in general for L.A. Noire is what I would describe as amateurish. The 'writer and director' and I put that in quotes, is credited as Brendan McNamara. I don't know how much influence he actually had, but I would love to pin this story on him because it's honestly terrible. And once again - amateurish. This game, L.A. Noire, was released in 2011, and yet it has seemingly a child's understanding of a lot of things, in particular World War II.\n\nThere's two Rockstar writers credited, veterans who worked on most of the GTA games and then would go on to work on GTA V. If any of the writing in this game stands up to scrutiny, I would say it's the dialogue, and both of these guys are credited very specifically as 'dialogue writers'. Michael Unsworth and Rupert Humphries.\n\nNow that I've talked about my main issues with the gameplay, I can get into the background stuff, it's almost more interesting than the game itself - which as I have basically said, is not very good.\n\nTeam Bondi who were the main dev team on L.A. Noire bit off way more than they could chew, Rockstar who was publishing for them came in and brought devs to bail them out, and then gradually took more and more creative control over from the Team Bondi guys, who were a lot of kids hired out of university. Some were put into made-up job positions such as 'Junior Level Designer' but all were paid terrible salaries such as 35k-45k AUD a year.\n\nEmployees worked 70 hour work weeks late in development, from 9AM to 7PM Monday to Saturday and even Sundays too. No one wanted to animate for Team Bondi so they had no lead animator for most of development. When the game came out, over 30 staff were owed a combined total of $1 million AUD in unpaid wages - which lines up with the fact that some people were not being paid upfront, but at the end of the project supposedly in exchange for working particular hours. There was ramping crunch from 2007-2011.\n\nTeam Bondi had high turnover rates and there are many disgruntled employees who have testified that the infamous 'writer and director' above Brendan McNamara is kind of not a nice guy. There's another name that comes up frequently, Vicky Lord, who sounds like a fountain of BS. Everyone working on the game for the last two years or maybe more of development, were told in emails that the game is 'just around the corner' and 'very near to being complete' so everyone just needed to crunch a little bit harder.\n\nNone of these stories really should be remotely surprising if you keep up with similar stories in the news from the past few years of gamedevs being paid too little to do too much work. But I found it enlightening to read up on it. \n\nTeam Bondi is gone. I don't know who gets paid when you buy this. So don't.\n\nL.A. Noire is a hollow shell of a game with an unsatisfying story.", "timestamp_created": 1735897796, "timestamp_updated": 1735897796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52837669849395752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184602738": {"recommendationid": "184602738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363268218", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1736366830}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally get to enjoy L.A before the liberals invented the EPA and took away our coveted smog", "timestamp_created": 1735885022, "timestamp_updated": 1735885022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184600599": {"recommendationid": "184600599", "author": {"steamid": "76561199275103719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1736746295}, "language": "english", "review": "underrated game\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735882391, "timestamp_updated": 1735882391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184594362": {"recommendationid": "184594362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417373603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2069, "last_played": 1735875164}, "language": "german", "review": "jack kelso eine chance bitte", "timestamp_created": 1735875638, "timestamp_updated": 1735875638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184588724": {"recommendationid": "184588724", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056605117", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1736045870}, "language": "english", "review": "Still great in 2025!", "timestamp_created": 1735870046, "timestamp_updated": 1735870046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184584252": {"recommendationid": "184584252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032854377", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 1793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1793, "last_played": 1504382610}, "language": "russian", "review": "2017 \u0433. \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b. 1 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b, \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 : ) \u0420\u0415\u041a\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0414\u0423\u042e, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e!", "timestamp_created": 1735865864, "timestamp_updated": 1735865864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184573225": {"recommendationid": "184573225", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970809925", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3809, "last_played": 1735855932}, "language": "french", "review": "Doubt", "timestamp_created": 1735856069, "timestamp_updated": 1735856069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184567686": {"recommendationid": "184567686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004609331", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 643, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1737399198}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich mag es mal die Cops zu spielen.\r\nDie F\u00e4lle sind gut geschrieben.

I enjoyed uncovering the greater mystery at the end of every desk and the overarching story finishes up in a relatively interesting way. Picking up all the newspapers gives a lot of context for the main story. Each case takes about an hour and there's 26 cases divided across 5 desks (the types of crimes you're solving). There's also 40 short street crimes that take a few minutes which pop up from time to time.  \r\n\r\nThe truth/doubt/lie system is a little clunky, but you get used to it after the first few cases. The faces of the people when you're interviewing them are pure comedy, best part of the game. Driving around feels good, but you can really speed up the game a lot by having your partner drive. It really rewards you for uncovering all the clues in each crime scene. Can't really speak to the graphics quality or the accuracy of the 1947 Los Angeles it portrays since I'm playing it 13 years after it came out. It looks like an old game, and the dialogue definitely matches the times. I found it all pretty easy to look past.\r\n\r\nIf it's over 50% off, you enjoy the puzzle/mystery genre and/or you like other games by Rockstar, I'd say it's worth a picking up and playing through.

O protagonista e Detetive Phelps um veterano Tenente do USMC, condecorado com her\u00f3i de guerra, o qual agora trabalha da LAPD. A trama do jogo se envolve em resolver casos como homic\u00eddios, narc\u00f3ticos, roubo a ve\u00edculos e o combate a corrup\u00e7\u00e3o dentro da pr\u00f3pria policia e governo.\r\n\r\nO jogo tem uma historia incr\u00edvel, e o que da mais profundidade e saber que diversos casos relatados durante o jogo, s\u00e3o baseados (alguns sao praticamente iguais) em casos reais, o que deixa um peso ainda maior na narrativa do jogo (O v\u00eddeo no Youtube: \u201cHow Historically Accurate is L.A. Noire?\u201d mostra isso em detalhes).\r\n\r\nPorem tenho que assumir que a vers\u00e3o de PC veio com v\u00e1rios problemas, o primeiro e o pre\u00e7o, acho que esta sendo cobrado muito caro em pre\u00e7o cheio, mas em promo\u00e7\u00e3o comprei por menos de 30 reais. Segundo e a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o, percebe-se que foi um Port muito mal feito, pois o jogo e capado a 30 FPS e os controles n\u00e3o s\u00e3o dos melhores, mas nada que justifique n\u00e3o jogar. Outra coisa que n\u00e3o gostei, achei que foi muito pouco desenvolvida foi em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a \"Trai\u00e7\u00e3o do Phelps\", mas n\u00e3o quero comentar muito por conta de spoilers...\r\n\r\nEm resumo recomendo bastante para quem gosta do g\u00eanero, mesmo com seus problemas acredito ainda ser um dos melhores t\u00edtulos da Rockstar.

If you think you are a good sleuth I would recommend in giving it a try!", "timestamp_created": 1735084446, "timestamp_updated": 1735084446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183606180": {"recommendationid": "183606180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012081305", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2682, "last_played": 1735777829}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm only about 15% done with the game so far, I'll prob update this review later on once I'll get to 100%. \n\nSo far, this god-awful interrogation system is actual AIDS.\nIt literally feels like RNG gambling to choose the right option, and there is no real way to restart the interrogation, except restarting the whole case or constantly quitting back to main menu (you will likely have to collect clues all over again though). \n\n\"Doubt\" ESPECIALLY is such a shitty, unclear option. I am aware that these options were all called something else before being released on PC, but either way there is no clear way to know if you're supposed to either select a doubt or lie (& evidence). I am good at realizing if something is a lie (despite the fact that the face of whoever you're interviewing always looks just constipated and/or weird most of the time), but deciding what the absurd, specific evidence is supposed to be the \"right\" one also makes no real sense at times. This game is like 45% interrogations and they made this part of the gameplay such an un-enjoyable, illogical, gamble of what the right option should be.\n\nAlso, why does this require rockstar launcher? does a singleplayer game REALLY need it? lol. (I had no issues with the launcher itself though)\n\nMaybe buy it at an astronomical discount, because there is no way this ancient game is still really worth a whole 20$.\n\nEdit: \nI've played through a few more cases, and it's just awful, snoozefest of an experience.\nThe \"action\", especially shooting is quite boring and way too repetitive. Street Crimes are mostly un-creative \"shoot goons\" which tends to just throw you off the case you're doing.\n\nThe interrogation system was just as awful as it was in the first few cases. Intuition points are almost impossible to come by after like Rank 8-10, and why the fuck are they capped at 5? Either way, the only good option is the \"ask the community\", removing an answer is almost always useless (In my experience it would always just remove \"lie\", which seems to be the most rare correct out of truth or doubt anyway). \nThis whole \"faces tell you if they're lying or not\" is also absolutely unreliable bullshit. In the \"Red Lipstick Murder\" Case, when you interview bar owner, on the last third question, he makes a completely neutral looking face, and his statement seemed correct, but oh no, I was apparently supposed to choose \"doubt\" there, yeah ok.\nAnother example would be \"Golden Butterfly\" Case when interviewing the daughter, on the second question she made a completely neutral face, her statement seemed true, but no it was also apparently doubt, yeah ok. How the fuck do you fuck up the most integral game mechanic? Nope, I'm done with dealing with this bullshit.\n\nThe achievements are boring and like 1/3 of them are just \"collect 10 gorillion of this\" and 95 WHOLE VEHICLES, most of which look the fucking same. \n\nCharacter/partner dialogue is almost non-existent and if you have to pay attention to the road you'll probably miss a good bit of it anyway. \n\nMaybe back then this game would be considered fun and \"revolutionary\" due to the face animations or something, but it has aged like a loaf of bread, it's quite an awful and boring experience. Can't even refund this anymore. Thank fucking god I bought it a discount. Quite an overhyped game.\n\nEdit 2:\nCompleted 100%. I'll have to cut this review edit much shorter due to word limit.\nAfter completely flopping the golden butterfly case because interrogations don't make much fucking sense, I've just been using a steam guide to double check my option before actually pressing it. Which I personally recommend you do too (unless you do not care about achievements).\n- Interrogations still sucked throughout the whole game, without a guide I'd only get about slightly over half of them correct on average (so I would always only get 4 stars despite doing none or minimal damage when driving or finding over 90% of clues). The faces were still very inconsistent & unreliable, sometimes they make the most goofy blatant faces when they lie, but then they'd say some half-truth shit or something that you literally cannot verify with anything and make a completely normal neutral looking face, but no it wasn't actually a \"truth\" statement, which is still complete bs. I now kinda see why the intuition points are capped at 5 (because past rank 20 you just get 5 points on every case), but with how bad the system you should be allowed to use up to like 10. Another reason why this truth, doubt, and lie system is bad is because you can't actually tell what Cole himself is thinking or is going to say once you actually press those options (besides lie, which you can back out of, unlike with the latter). You either should be allowed a second chance to ask the same question OR let those options be more descriptive of what Cole is actually going to say. It also sucks how you have to rely only on the face, instead of the whole body language, like them fidgeting with hands when they lie, etc. Some evidence which should prove a lie don't apparently prove a lie, can't recall any specific examples since I stopped bothering with the system past that homicide case. \n- Bringing completely new game mechanics out of nowhere past early game, with straight up death (fail) if you don't do them right. Such as balancing on objects and especially the very weird balancing mechanic when walking on planks and such. The collapsing platforms when walking in the tar pit were also a bit annoying.\n- Janky, Clunky inspection of objects (evidence), especially when inspecting (usually dead) bodies. Sometimes it asks you for a really weird hyper-specific angle which you could barely hold before it finally zooms into some detail on an object, which was a mildly annoying. \n- Speaking of evidence, those little brief descriptions of evidence you find in the notebook are quite bad, especially for any large paper documents or letters you find. There should've been an option to inspect those more closer in detail without having to constantly return to them. It sometimes felt like those little descriptions would also leave out important parts of that evidence.\n- Why add 95 whole different vehicles (even though most really just look the same and have near identical stats with exception of bonus cars) with this huge of a map with so many roads, and not put garage's or something around the map to actually use those vehicles you collect? Very odd. Devs practically already have the system with the vehicle room showcase in the menu to use for that.\n- Newspaper collectibles. Why would you assign so much story/lore to missable collectibles? But then make the other like 100 collectibles (landmarks, 50 fucking gold film reels, police badges) have completely no rewards or anything besides a few achievements? Also quite questionable.\n- Pedestrian NPCs would sometimes just run into your car instead of evading it or VERY slowly walk across the road despite you blaring the siren. Same with the driver NPCs just spontaneously turning right into your path or stopping right in front of you (with siren on), happened a bit too many times to be ignored. Quite annoying.\n- Roy's car sucks so much. Acceleration, turning, general handling, etc. is much poorer than the car of any other 3 partners you get.\n- Why even add a flamethrower? You literally only get to use it to kill like 4 dudes at the worst possible scenario. It was so hilariously bad how you had to waddle with it in water while being shot at and then try to kill them in such open areas with how shitty the range of it is.\n-Chasing is often so scripted even in street crimes. \n\nThe map itself (not graphics) is good. Radio music & audio in general is great. Story is quite good (ending mid at best).
