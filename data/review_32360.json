There is SO much to love about these remakes.  I played both at time of their original release (1990 & 1991 respectively).  I am pretty sure when I played The Secret of Monkey Island that it was the 16-colour version :D and by the time LeChuck's Revenge came out it was 256 colour VGA.  So, firstly, I really like how (in both games) you can press a key to instantly and seamlessly revert back to the original game (in The Secret, it reverts back to the 256 version, which is kind of a shame because I'd have liked to seen the 16-colour again, but no complaints).  The interface is VERY easy to use.  When I first started playing The Secret, I thought I wouldn't like the new graphics and interface but, in fact, I ended up LOVING the GUI and the graphics and artwork.  This is a delightful adventure that is lighthearted and jovial.  Unlike Sierra games (and, I love Sierra games, so this isn't a dis), you can't really die and there is no way (that I've discovered) that you can miss something that then triggers you to restore way back to much earlier in the game (this can happen in Sierra games, as there are certain puzzles whereby if you didn't get certain inventory items earlier on then you were simply screwed - hopefully you saved often!!).  The plot unfolds in a pleasing way and although there isn't a ton of character development amongst the characters, it doesn't detract from the game-play at all.

Ich hatte vorher nur Vollgas full throttle als Kind gespielt und etwas sp\u00e4ter Day of the Tentacle. Ich wusste zwar von Monkey Island jedoch ist es in Vergessenheit geraten. Als ich die Collection dann auf Steam entdeckt habe, wusste ich dieses Spiel bzw. die Reihe darf nicht unber\u00fchrt bleiben. Und was soll ich sagen? The Secret of Monkey Island hat mich von Anfang bis Ende einfach nur gepackt. \n\nEs l\u00e4dt einen dazu ein in das Spiel einzutauchen. Die R\u00e4tsel fordern kreatives Denken und sind sehr Unterhaltsam. Besonders hervorzuheben sind die humorvollen Dialoge die voller Wortwitz und Anspielungen stecken. Grunds\u00e4tzlich ist der Humor das Herzst\u00fcck des Spiels. Es nimmt sich nicht zu Ernst, \u00fcberschreitet jedoch nicht die Grenze ins l\u00e4cherliche. \n\nDie Atmosph\u00e4re ist durch detailreiche Szenenbilder sowie der tollen Musik sehr gut umgesetzt. Positiv m\u00f6chte ich hervorheben, dass man einfach per Tastendruck zwischen der Grafik der Neuauflage und der Originalgrafik aus 1990 wechseln kann. So kann man sich die sch\u00f6nen Schaupl\u00e4tze aus einer anderen Perspektive ansehen. \n\nFazit: Es ist ein Spiel, das zurecht Geschichte geschrieben hat und den absoluten Kultstatus genie\u00dft. Es bietet eine perfekte Mischung aus Abenteuer Humor und R\u00e4tseln. Ein Muss f\u00fcr jeden der in diesem Genre bereits Erfahrungen hat oder dieses Genre kennenlernen m\u00f6chte. \n\nEin Lob an die Entwickler. 10/10 !", "timestamp_created": 1735387831, "timestamp_updated": 1735387831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872172832489014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183941060": {"recommendationid": "183941060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298847544", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1684006729}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un cl\u00e1sico de los v\u00eddeo juegos con un lavado de cara, si te gustan las aventuras de texto, este juego es una obligaci\u00f3n absoluta para ti. 7 de 10", "timestamp_created": 1735352464, "timestamp_updated": 1735352464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183822137": {"recommendationid": "183822137", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960792585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1561177264}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games ever made", "timestamp_created": 1735257829, "timestamp_updated": 1735257829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183773608": {"recommendationid": "183773608", "author": {"steamid": "76561199274110366", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 200, "playtime_at_review": 6346, "last_played": 1736441434}, "language": "english", "review": "fun reading and puzzle solving game", "timestamp_created": 1735233495, "timestamp_updated": 1735233495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183703036": {"recommendationid": "183703036", "author": {"steamid": "76561199257794418", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1185, "last_played": 1735169526}, "language": "latam", "review": "Con una historia muy buena, puzzles desafiantes pero a la vez graciosos e inesperados \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb, unos gr\u00e1ficos mejorados haciendo que el gameplay sea muy divertido, personajes queridos + entra\u00f1ables y una banda sonora magistral \ud83c\udfb6\u2728.
