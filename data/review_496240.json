Most everyone knows the graphical hit that came with Quest support, and there's been improvements but the game still looks pretty bad and feels weirdly over contrasted on my index, blacks are so black that enemies can blend into objects even in the daytime. It feels incredibly hollow compared to other offerings like Pavlov and Contractors that have a huge host of mod content and game modes, Onward in comparison is really lacking.  \r\n\r\nIronically the thing I most hated about Onward (the sacrifice of PC fidelity to bring Quest compatibility) is what led me to buy it to have something cross platform to play with my cousin, but that is the only time I launch the game. I've owned it maybe two years now and have 15hrs while Pavlov has nearly 150. \r\n\r\nThere's just not much to do. The PVP modes are alright but get old quick, and most often we want to do PVE which is even worse. The PVE modes are different but functionally feel the same. The new mode is more of the same. If you played it once you experienced all it has to offer. I was hoping for a more dynamic experience but ultimately each mission reward offerings is basically the same every time, the first mission you always get a choice of two snipers and a shotgun. It's just so repetitive, and the missions end up being so boring because the difficultly scaling feels all over the place. It's either a cake walk that you spend the entire mission walking around just trying to find where the enemies are or it's all of a sudden challenging and there's no in between. \r\n\r\nSo most of it you are bored out of your mind until you get to the mission where you suddenly get evaporated, and each mission tends to be so short you spend half the time sitting at the loadout screen. You'll be 3 missions in and have like 4 kills and feel like you've really done nothing but you've completed 3 missions and spent 30 minutes for it. The Mercenary mode was supposed to give different loadouts and varying unique missions, but it ends up feeling the exact same each time. \r\n\r\nAudio wise the game is great with the best audio of any VR shooter I've played, the guns feel good needing good control and trigger discipline, I like the short time to kill and high stakes, but the core gameplay loop is just not at all enticing. \r\n\r\nUltimately nothing draws me back to this game. I relaunched it and ran through it again for the sake of this review to see if anything had changed but it hasn't. Outside of my cousin wanting to play I never launch it, and it's a shame because I love the short time to kill, the audio, and the gun feel, but there's just nothing fun to do with it. None of the PVP or PVE game modes feel enticing they just feel so boring and repetitive. \r\n\r\nI came back and played maybe an hour and just felt like I had wasted an hour because it was the exact same as every other time I played it. The PVE modes are just boring and lackluster and need a significant rework, and I didn't even bother with PVP because it's pretty well the same story there.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1737241603, "timestamp_updated": 1737241603, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185829042": {"recommendationid": "185829042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191126581", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1675115127}, "language": "english", "review": "D1 fumble", "timestamp_created": 1737171421, "timestamp_updated": 1737171421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185821469": {"recommendationid": "185821469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041547274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 848, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1737372684}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1737161585, "timestamp_updated": 1737161585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185813842": {"recommendationid": "185813842", "author": {"steamid": "76561199109380649", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1667681890}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok, I didnt like the resolution/graphics.", "timestamp_created": 1737152517, "timestamp_updated": 1737152517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185769474": {"recommendationid": "185769474", "author": {"steamid": "76561199497666672", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1737195606}, "language": "french", "review": "Ne fonctionne pas bien (d\u00e9chirures d'image partout dans le casque, j'ai essay\u00e9 d'y rem\u00e9dier mais rien \u00e0 faire).

"language": "english", "review": "Alright, I've been thinking about writing this for a few days, and now I will.\n\nFirst, I wanna say that at the time I am writing this I have 38.9 hours on Steam, but I probably have similar amount of time on Quest.\n\nThis game is easily one of the best VR shooters I've ever played. The game has built-in motion/hand smoothing, so it's not like Pavlov where if you have shaky hands you won't be able to hit shit. The guns overall just feel so nice to hold and use, and reloading and firing has no problem, especially with the balanced recoil this game has. But obviously, that's what you're here for on VR shooters. The gun feel.\n\nBut for the actual game, it's still amazing with its maps, mechanics, and communication. Having a team of 4 - 5 players all frequently communicating makes this one of the most fun and immersive VR experiences out there. But, speaking of immersion, I'm pretty sure this game's optimization has been abandoned. No matter if you are using a Quest 3 (like me) with a native resolution of 2064 x 2208, on both Steam and Quest the max graphics is something like 1832 x 1920. Yes, even on SteamVR when you scale the graphics higher than that (I think), or on Quest 3 Native when the default resolution is 2064 x 2208. This may lead to the overall environment in the distance not being very immersive when they are at a lower quality.\n\nThe gamemodes are very-- well, tactical. You can escort a VIP to an extraction point while the enemy team tries to kill him (anyone can play as the VIP), you can upload a code to an uplink station while the enemy team tries to defend it, and you can make your way around enemy NPCs to an extraction point in the dark. Oh, and speaking of dark, every official map has its own night mode, where you have to wear night vision goggles as you fight for the objective. The night vision is very immersive with the digital filter attachment, which uses 3 loadout attachments/points (max is 20 in PvP, max is 30 in co-op), but it costs no attachments to use a green, white, or amber phosphor on the goggles.\n\nThere are 4 loadout classes:\n\nRifleman, specializing in automatic (and some semi-auto) mid-ranged rifles.\n\nSpecialist, specializing in more rare and unusual weapons with cool attachments (such as grenade launchers). Weapons are usually small and very fast-firing. Also the only class with SMGs available, pretty sure.\n\nSupport: Specializing in heavier weapons like LMGs for suppressive and powerful fire.\n\nMarksman: Specializing in long-ranged weapons like sniper rifles, and even has equipment like air drones and ground drones.\n\nEvery class works on every official map (I say official map as this game does have workshop support for custom maps, which even has some very popular and high-rated map in the regular map-choosing queue) in its own special way.\n\nOverall, if you wanna see a small and rare amount of annoying children, want fun, tactical, and suspenseful gunplay, large, open maps, and an occasional RPG or ballistic shield, then this is the perfect game.\n\nHowever, this game does not get mass updates (which it SHOULD get) that would make it much more popular. There also are no stats, every game is just for fun and improvement, and I doubt that will ever change in the future considering this game is 8 years old. Still a really fun and very active game, you won't have an issue finding any games.\n\nI don't know what to give it out of 10, but I can say:\n\nIt good. It fun.\n\nEdit made 5 seconds after uploading: Oh, yeah, this game is crossplay with Quest.", "timestamp_created": 1735499815, "timestamp_updated": 1735499932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184067260": {"recommendationid": "184067260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296494594", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1737362962}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u5355\u673a\u73a9\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u53ea\u73a9\u5355\u673a\u4e5f\u5bf9\u5f97\u8d77\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\r\n\u4f46\u662f\u653e\u5f03steam\u4e13\u641e\u4e00\u4f53\u673a\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba9\u8fd9\u8fb9\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u4e86\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u7ed9\u4f60\u5dee\u8bc4\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1735451233, "timestamp_updated": 1735451233, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183932732": {"recommendationid": "183932732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199465658207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 714, "last_played": 1737403629}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game", "timestamp_created": 1735345295, "timestamp_updated": 1735345295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514705896377563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183908373": {"recommendationid": "183908373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160506707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4112, "last_played": 1735523641}, "language": "english", "review": "i like it", "timestamp_created": 1735328062, "timestamp_updated": 1735328062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514705896377563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183874807": {"recommendationid": "183874807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847465023", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1735463710}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Graphics, Good Gameplay, Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1735305048, "timestamp_updated": 1735305048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183869423": {"recommendationid": "183869423", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241419624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1736676430}, "language": "english", "review": "Top 3 VR game fun to piss about with friends", "timestamp_created": 1735300382, "timestamp_updated": 1735300382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514705896377563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183822930": {"recommendationid": "183822930", "author": {"steamid": "76561199205743226", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "playtime_at_review": 1338, "last_played": 1736544665}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't play before 1.8 and never knew what they did to the game.
