The most common is that some survivor in your camp is upset and needs to be taken out to beat zombies to death, and have a \"talking to\" and this boosts morale temporarily.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you go off to solve one side quest, a half-dozen more, repetitive side quests always pop up. You may go to retrieve a watch from the starting location for one of the characters, only to have the main base attacked by yet another group of roving hordes of zombies.\r\n\r\nNothing you ever do in the game is of any consequence of significance in advancing any meaningful or worthwhile story.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a bad game, but it is a mediocre game that simply falls way flat in terms of the potential it had and what it could have realized.
