Must have been in a bundle, or I grabbed some other game at the same time and it stole my attention, but boy was that wrong.\n\nHeat Signature is Hotline Miami by way of FTL, a roguelite sci-fi John Wick simulator with engaging game play, some really great immersive-sim-lite \"it just works\" shenanigans and some really clever game design and mechanics. I won't say it's frustration free (having a character mission to assassinate an armored target when you just can't find armor piercing weapons because of RNG is painful) and some enemy types can just come down to \"Did you get lucky with your loot drops so far this run?\" but it has the punchy satisfying combat that Hotline Miami and its cohort have introduced- high stakes, high reward combat, with both ranged and melee options. \n\nAlthough it's easy to become the ultimate killing machine by the end of a character's development, there are enough threats and challenges that the combat rarely gets stale. Characters retire after completing personal missions, and starting a new character can put you at the whims of RNG for your first couple missions so sometimes it can feel like you've lost a lot, but taking over the universe requires sacrifice. Persistent unlocks for capturing stations expand your shop inventories so you can pick up the toys you personally find fun to use pretty early into subsequent runs. This keeps you from getting too stuck into a specific loop, and you can always park a mercenary and give someone else a spin if you've found a build you really like (though you will get less liberation progress the more you play the same character). \n\nUltimately, Heat Signature is a shenanigans filled game that lets you play either John Wick or a slapstick comedy version depending on how things play out, and there are a lot of gadgets and toys in addition to weapons that add strategic and tactical depth to your playthrough.
