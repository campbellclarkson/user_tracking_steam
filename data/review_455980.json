It can get pretty unforgiving with a few bad mistakes. (Say for example meeting a new settlement who is hostile and keeps attacking you every 5 minutes, but you don't have the troops to actually wipe them out. Speaking from experience here.) But other then that the core game is enjoyable. Fun alternative game modes and a workshop with some helpful re balancing stuff if you ever want to start experimenting with goofy mechanics. \n\nOne time I downloaded a mod that reduced hit chance minimums to below 30% to try to make a proper samurai and boy was it goofy. My 0% chance to be hit guy was chilling until like fallen angels and the other high accuracy people started nuking him. \n\nAnyway just a fun game and for 9$ on sale is worth a pickup for some goofery.", "timestamp_created": 1735321696, "timestamp_updated": 1735321696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479798197746276855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1773, "total_negative": 414, "total_reviews": 2187}, "cursors": {"AoJww9vuqIYDdpvn+gM=": "Mon Jan 20 19:08:26 2025"}}
