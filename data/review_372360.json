There is a mod tho fix the HD models however you should't have to buy a game just to mod it. So it's not worth getting. If you own a game cube buy the cd copy of it. otherwise your better off using an emulator and playing the game cube version that way.

It's definitely not a game for those who don't like JRPGs and their unique atmosphere and tone. But even if you do, this is one of the worst of the Tales games, a series I love. Combat is a bit iffy; as the first game in the series to allow movement in 3 dimensions, it's rough, understandably, although it does get better after the first like 35 hours. The equipment and leveling systems range from standard to a bit annoying, with alot of elements just feeling like busy work for the sake of having mechanics. The extra content and side-quests are the worst kind of \"Talk to everyone, everywhere, every time a story beat happens, if you want to see them.\" The world building is poor. \r\n\r\nBut the major thing that will likely turn people off is the story. It's not that it's a bad story, but it is, along with Zesteria, one of the most in-your-face, My Little Pony-esque stories about love and friendship saving the world you've ever seen. I like the characters, they are the only thing making the game palatable enough, but it's just so safe. Even when bad things happen, it's over and done with in minutes. Earlier games simply had less story to them, keeping it moving along at a brisk pace, while most of the later games, while still presented in a fairly light-hearted tone most of the time, had more dark moments and really let them have an impact. There were difficult decisions to be made, sacrifices, struggles, but one of the themes of THIS game is literally NOT to have sacrifices, that everything should work out a-ok and eveyone should be saved and so on. It's just the same freaking beat, over and over again, for dozens of hours. I'm not saying it's a bad beat, I'm not an edgelord who dislikes the concepts involved, but it feels so shallow when your protagonist's infinite goodness just makes everything turn out peachy in nearly every situation--even one of the bad experiences he has, early on, is recontextualized as ultimately a good thing and it was everyone else who was wrong later in the game. \r\n\r\nShort review, but that really is the game's summary; pretty typical Tales game but with a story so sweet it can cause diabetes. Considering how long it is and how much dialogue there is, the lack of competing views or thought-provoking situations just ultimately makes it mind-numbing to get through. If you've never played a Tales game, Vesperia, Berseria, and Arise, are all on Steam, and are all much better entry-games to the series.", "timestamp_created": 1735754834, "timestamp_updated":
