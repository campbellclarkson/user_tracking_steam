Tho the things i really liked were the mechanism for the locked doors that you had to keep holdin E for it to open that was cool, And the thing i liked about the special (Jumping) Gravity Gun was that you could not spam it everywhere and it has a cooldown so you have to use some different weapons aswell. I also liked the hidden QR codes around the game but the thing that confused me the most was the giant zombie fight i dont know they were just keep coming so i didnt know if i had to kill them all cuz they were keep spawning or to block an entrance to make them stop coming i hope you get what i mean, but after like 5th try i just kept killin them and they stopped spawning after some time so yeah.. It aslo had an interesting story to tell because of the notes left from the refugees so that was cool, and the animation of falling down from the shaft was a nice touch too. The zombie fight and the last fight with the striders were both fine but other than that for me there was a lack of some serious action and there could be some more puzzles but whatever for me it was a great and kinda short mod but surely took a lot of effort and time to make.\n\nAnyways i enjoyed the mod and i reccomend you to go and play it, its good to try some new mechanics and weapons, its not that looong so instead of watching some movie on the evening just go play this mod instead!\n\nMy rating: 7:10", "timestamp_created": 1736864954, "timestamp_updated": 1736865422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185482551": {"recommendationid": "185482551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842118273", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1736722372}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Uma pequena experi\u00eancia razo\u00e1vel.\n\nUm mod de HL 2 independente, que eu n\u00e3o entendi muito bem a hist\u00f3ria pra falar a verdade.
