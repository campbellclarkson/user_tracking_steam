I think that the story might be best experienced in the anime, but it's still good in the game.\n\nSetting: 10/10\nAs a great war rages on the continent, a previously neutral country is invaded and has to defend itself. The technological level in this world is similar to the early mid-1900's with the main differences seemingly being because of the resource ragnite which is used for fuel and a wide variety of other applications. And there are no planes.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nIt's turn-based tactics, but with a unique flair. Instead of telling each soldier where to go, you control them directly and as you move the enemy will fire on you. This makes it feel more like you're in live combat and not as if the entire battle pauses for you to take your turn. You thus have to think before you move and not stop out in the open.\nThere are different soldier classes with separate uses, strengths and weaknesses to use for your plans.\nThe gameplay is really fun and the main reason I'm recommending the game.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nIt's anime style, but on top of that there's a shader that makes any shot from the game look like it was hand-drawn. It's beautiful!\nI was actually tricked in the menu where you can read the characters' biographies.
