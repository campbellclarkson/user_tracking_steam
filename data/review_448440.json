A game completed by a solo dev, it does struggle with some odd English dialogue but it does have a corny/cheesy charm to it that makes it unique. It's interesting that you can switch between players with different skills and follow the story-line in multiple ways. I also like that the game's subject is more unique and story was interesting. \n\nThat said, the game is rather slow. The controls were a bit fiddly and sometimes what you're supposed to do wasn't entirely clear. After an hour, I knew that the game wasn't for me. I am still recommending it though, because this game IS for someone. I think it's worth a play if you have the patience - especially for under a dollar (USD). \n\nI played this game as part of my games Under $5 series and got it on sale for $0.49 (USD).
