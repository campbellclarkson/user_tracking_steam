Every gun (and knife, and tool, and prop, you know where im going with this) can be played with and the guns (obviously) have a gigantic range of attachments with nearly no limit to what you could put on them\n\nAnton, the lead dev, is an incredible part of the entire community and this is one of the best updated and managed games ive seen in my life even outside of vr.

Nearly every single aspect of the game is moddable (Take and hold, guns, etc) To add even more content on top of the giant base game\n\nI never look at games this way, but objectively this game is just a steal for its price.

Getting 94 hours out of a 20 dollar VR game, is even more unheard of. \r\n\r\nTypically VR games just do not have that level of staying power, but this one absolutely does, and its not even finished yet (technically, but any other developer would call this finished, but anton is not just any other developer).", "timestamp_created": 1736591483, "timestamp_updated": 1736591483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185318527": {"recommendationid": "185318527", "author": {"steamid": "76561199760548920", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 198, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1737152949}, "language": "english", "review": "funnn", "timestamp_created": 1736570949, "timestamp_updated": 1736570949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185311801": {"recommendationid": "185311801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859215421", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1736639420}, "language": "english", "review": "least user-friendly and optimized game ive seen in a WHILE.\nseriously how do people manage to make games so poorly?", "timestamp_created": 1736563574, "timestamp_updated": 1736563574, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44373437762260437", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185307647": {"recommendationid": "185307647", "author": {"steamid": "76561199757268430", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1736904658}, "language": "english", "review": "this is by far the peak of vr content. if you buy this your children will never bring you the same joy. you will be a broken man. a shell of your former self it is shear joy.", "timestamp_created": 1736558860, "timestamp_updated": 1736558860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185302267": {"recommendationid": "185302267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018677833", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 2919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 157, "playtime_at_review": 2879, "last_played": 1736723603}, "language": "english", "review": "i shoot the gun, the meat explodes. a necessity to own if u have vr", "timestamp_created": 1736553196, "timestamp_updated": 1736553196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185300239": {"recommendationid": "185300239", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967033932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1736549434}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cool, but very lonely.

practice sniping \nwhich btw through this game and later going to a range i learned i am incredible at sniping \nits too bad im not cut out for the military. \nand its funny because i am trash at competitive multiplayer shooting games \n\nthis game is fun and despite some of the controls being a bit all over the place from gun to gun and device to device \nits fun. \ni mean sometimes i dont even use the guns. one of my favorite things to do is go to the desert map and place a whole bunch of c4 in a stack and then launch various objects with it like buckets and roll targets \nor play with the giant pistol there by launching the explosive spread shot into the air and playing dodge the rain of death\n\nthe fact that this game is pretty much made by one person is amazing \nand i love how it still gets very frequent updates and stuff \n\ni played through both the western setting and the zombie stories and enjoyed them thoroughly \ni will say i dont care much for take and hold. but the various other game modes are a lot of fun \ni do wish there was at least one more story driven campaign style game mode \n\neven in its early access state which at the time of review Anton keeps telling us in every update video that oh its almost done its almost done and then that needle just gets pushed back \npersonly im fine with that more content is more fun anyway \nbut anyway \neven in

"review": "This game is a VR shooter killer. I've tried buying and playing multiple other VR shooters and none can compete with this one. It plays great on my mid-tier system (both modded and vanilla) and I\u2019d imagine it would still be a solid experience on a lesser rig. I have been keeping up with the weekly dev logs for quite some time now and it's very clear that Anton (the dev) cares for this game a lot. An unprecedented amount of detail is put into this that screams \u201cI love what I do!\u201d. The updates are frequent and he\u2019s very open about what he\u2019s working on. As someone who has a tistic love of firearms, being able to operate the plethora of historical and modern pieces of kit is remarkable considering 95% or more of the guns in the game wouldn\u2019t be able to be owned legally where I\u2019m from *sigh*\u2026Canada. I keep coming back to it so I highly recommend it if you enjoy them even somewhat. The game is a sandbox with a ton of stuff for you to try.\n\nI just recently got into modding the game and it gave it a new and exciting world for me to dig a hole to put myself into - modular firearms. Being able to build one from scratch in whatever style, length, and caliber I want has given me a whole new level of love for what this game can do. Plus it gives the ability to play new game modes on completely different maps than what are in vanilla. Zombies - yup, supply raid/take and hold on a 747 - uh huh, and tons more to try. I can\u2019t recommend this game enough. It could cost 3x what it does now, and it still would be worth it IMO. \n\n9.69/10 Nice!\n", "timestamp_created": 1735452611, "timestamp_updated": 1735452611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5078125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184068026": {"recommendationid": "184068026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447687793", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 895, "last_played": 1709163012}, "language": "english", "review": "shoot sausage", "timestamp_created": 1735451966, "timestamp_updated": 1735451966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184064758": {"recommendationid": "184064758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066098039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1736999842}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, could use more updates, but potential for lots of laughs with friends in many different challenges.\r\nLots of guns to choose from, lots of options to choose from.\r\n\r\nI do wish you could load scenes from other users so you dont have to make your own. if this is already a thing, I dont know how you do it.", "timestamp_created": 1735448811, "timestamp_updated": 1735448811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184046543": {"recommendationid": "184046543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280654329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1736361214}, "language": "english", "review": "so much fun", "timestamp_created": 1735432776, "timestamp_updated": 1735432776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184036842": {"recommendationid": "184036842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188753019", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7116, "last_played": 1731729561}, "language": "english", "review": "Vary good game.
