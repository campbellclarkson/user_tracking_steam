It's just that with the recent direction of the game it is not really advisable for new players to still start playing.

Guild wars which was the highlight for many players was \"temporarily\" removed so they could introduce the new PvP system that is, you guessed it, focused on selling immortals for $$$. Now months later they are finally working on getting a new version of guild wars back in, we'll just have to wait and see if it's not too pay to win.\nThe recurring journey event was broken due to a nerf to the related troops, months later the only \"fix\" was a change to scoring. Which completely ignores the reason it is broken and just takes the lazy approach to fixing it after repeatedly telling us they were \"working on it\". The broke the alerts that many people used, and for weeks now the only message has been \"we're working on it\".\nAt the same time they pump out season pass after season pass and all kinds of other new offers focused on $$.
