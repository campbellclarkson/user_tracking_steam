The big difference here however is that while other games have you fight AI, in this game you are fighting a continuous flood of destructive fluid. Across all the games in the series you are always fighting this unrelenting fluid that allows the player to have an innate understanding of how the enemy works! Pair that with needing land-area to produce energy needed to power turrets and other machinery that keeps the Creeper at bay and you have this great puzzle that is new, yet very familiar.\n\nAs with any game of this type, there's 2 ways you can play it: You can either rush things before the Creeper can spread or you can turtle up as you gain a foothold and slowly take back parts of the map and quite literally turn the tide.\n\nThis third installment has polished and perfected it's gameplay and if you're just thinking of getting into Creeper World and want to start somewhere, PLEASE start from the first game. Due to me seeing and playing the third one, when I went back to the first one, it was a pure downgrade (Which it IS supposed to be. It's 2 games back!) and I didn't find it as engaging because I already had a taste of the expanded possibilities of this one.\n\nI'm a turtle through and through and I easily spent 45 minutes to an hour fighting some of the later levels and the time just flew by!
