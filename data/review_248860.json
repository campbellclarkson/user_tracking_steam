Unless the game is shit. This one, thankfully, is not and I didn't mind paying. \n\nSo what is this game? It's a game where you may fight homeless men to the death for their flip flops, and where four water bottles and a handful of string is considered a good loot haul. It's a game where you can throw hands with a werewolf and win so you can make a coat out of it, then you get a little careless while exploring former suburbia and get a facefull of black mold from opening a cabinet and die days later. It's a game where you can save up and get surgery to get bionic eye implants so you can pinpoint enemy weaknesses with ease, then slink back into the slums and warm yourself by a communal trashcan fire while you dine on a succulent meal of soup you've been saving in your Sonic Team Racing elementary school backpack. If it wasn't for the fact that the police force in Detroit is actually competent in this game I'd say this is a fairly accurate portrayal of Michigan, cryptids and all.\n\nOn a real note this game is pretty simple when you get right down to it. You have a hunger, thirst and fatigue meter. Letting one or a couple get too low for too long is a good way to end up dead very quickly. Another important thing to take into account is how you're dressed. This game doesn't have a lot of weather variation, but it is consistently cold. This means that if you can't get yourself adequately clothed pretty quick at the start of a run it'll be over before it begins. This sort of all-or-nothing form of RNG is a problem I'll address in a second. One of the strongest parts of this game is it's crafting system and inventory management. Encumbrance is a feature, but you also have space limits depending on what clothes and accessories you're wearing. NEO uses a grid system and items are sized accordingly. This makes an errant pair of cargo pants found in a car trunk something worth celebrating. Did I mention that weapons, tools and clothes also deteriarate over time? These things can be repaired and maintaned, however the repair items are so rare to find in the wild that it's not something you can depend on. This is just to say that you better get used to rotating clothes pretty normally. There are also shopping carts, sledges and a craftable travoi you can use to increase your weight capacity and item space. \n\nThis leads us to the very important aspect of crafting. In character creation you pick from two pools of traits and skills. One good, which costs you points for desireable attributes/skills, and one bad, which gives you a debilitation in exchange for more points to use on the other. Some debilitations are worse than others so some give more points than others. Some of these optional attributes give you access to bushcraft knowledge, fighting skills, technological knowhow and more. But once you're done with character creation you're locked in and it's unlikely you'll get more, so choose carefully! This would be more of a problem if it weren't for the fact that you'll be dying a LOT in your early hours of gametime. \n\"Okay but you were talking about crafting, what does that have to do with this?\" \nBecause, ye impatient and ill tempered, being able to make your own clothes from pelts and hides can be instrumental in your early game survival. Same thing with how tech knowledge can be instrumental in your lategame survival.\n\nHere's a pro tip if you keep dying of exposure early in a run. Take the traits strong, melee and trapping at creation and stay to fight the dogman in the beginning. This lets you kick the dogmans ass and kill it with few injuries. The reason we took trapping is because you can skin the dogman with a craftable shiv of glass and fabric to make a dogman fur coat. That alone is enough to keep you from dying of exposure for the forseeable future. You can also get the footage of your fight with the beast from the security cameras and use it as leverage to get into Detroit. You can also use the melee trait to craft spears which are both convenient to make and extremely useful in combat even in lategame. \n\nSo what problems does this game have? We can start with how bullshit it can be at times. There are a lot of times where you can worm your way out of a bad situation by smart thinking or brute strength. But you'll have a lot more moments where you die from diseases you can't diagnose, taking bad medicine, bandits that one shot you with a rifle, and many other things. The hardcore nature of the game makes any progress feel unimportant since it can be taken away from you so quickly. The other problem is the amount of content. This game does have an ending, and a pretty good one at that, so it's not infinite by any means. And the random encounters you can come across are pretty limited and some of them are quite rare. Once you get the basics of survival down you'll burn through most of the available content in like ten or fifteen hours. The ending is basically a sequel tease but, as of now, it doesn't look like Blue Bottle is working on one since they're so busy on Ostranauts. That wouldn't be so bad but they don't seem likely to add any content to NEO in the interim either. Even worse is that the amount of good mods to add to it are very low as well.\n\nAll in all this game is a very well crafted game with about enough content to keep you satiated for a couple days. If you stretch your sessions a bit a part of course. The price is about right, but again with how little content there is I'd reccomend waiting til a sale unless you're just dying to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1736453940, "timestamp_updated": 1736453940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566506087779998779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185004546": {"recommendationid": "185004546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066307391", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1734493551}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a nice novelty and i have a lot of biased nostalgia but flash really holds the game back\nP.S. take off your talisman for free items", "timestamp_created": 1736240189, "timestamp_updated": 1736240189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577672779560089111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184866128": {"recommendationid": "184866128", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230064506", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1736823366}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun scavenger game", "timestamp_created": 1736107149, "timestamp_updated": 1736107149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184803317": {"recommendationid": "184803317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037025342", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1736050100}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Buggy at times when crafting is needed(crashed basically reseted all of my camp sides and made progress  in story impossible) But \r\nmanaged to  beat it \r\nand honestly story wise its like a book with multiple possible endings  That needs a sequel.

Didnt even know of its existence up until that moment. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to give it a go and really feel like i stumbled upon a Gem. This game hits different. From the start of the game not knowing anything, im just hovering around the UI seeing what things there are to do. So i end up walking around the world and stumble upon this city. Not knowing what im going to discover i said \"why not\" as my character is hardly wearing any clothes. that is when i found my first big Item! I nice rifle with a sling that also has a few bullets in it as well as a hoodie and a t-shirt to help with the cold. \r\n\r\nSlowly starting to get the hang of it, i sleep for the night to wake up to someone charging me. It felt like this dude was sprinting at me from across the city. So I take my rifle and hide behind cover. Yelling over to the man charging asking to talk but to no success. I gave him a warning that if they dont surrender i will fire. so he kept charging. After putting 2 bullets in the guy he finally surrenders but a few hours later decided to charge at me again and that is when i gave him one last rifle hit with the butt of the gun to finish it off. Thankfully he had some pants and a shoe on him.\r\n\r\nA day of resting goes by and i really need another shoe and a drink so i loot the areas nearby fighting dogs and dogmen. I end up becoming very injured and catch a infection, so i decide to rest at camp but only for a dog to come while im resting and picks a fight. As the dog and I exchange blows I hit the dog with the butt of the rifle and it breaks only leaving me to my bare hands. The dog not giving up but coughing up blood manages to get a few bits in. as my character is very hurt he tries to swing 1 more time but slips and passes out. The dog finished the Job and killed me off and i honestly wouldn't want my first death to be any different XD\r\n\r\nAll in all game is really damn good and excited to put more time into it, Highly Recommend", "timestamp_created": 1735200237, "timestamp_updated": 1735200237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638888895511627197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183536667": {"recommendationid": "183536667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106470687", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1513, "last_played": 1503356214}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend this game if you love inventory management, dying of sepsis, and also eating people.\n\n10/10, I played so much of this game offline...", "timestamp_created": 1735013468, "timestamp_updated": 1735013468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 4648, "total_negative": 529, "total_reviews": 5177}, "cursors": {"AoJ43J3EnY4DdtWb5AQ=": "Mon Jan 20 16:59:19 2025"}}
