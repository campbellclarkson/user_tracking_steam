Yes. Is this game also a lot of fun and a great way to kill some time and just muck about during a boring afternoon? Also yes.\r\n\r\nIn case you're unfamiliar with the premise of this game, or its history as GMod Tower back in the day: Tower Unite isn't really a single game. Rather, it's a big collection of mini-games that presents itself as a sort of fancy sun-dipped summer holiday resort where you arrive by train every time you log into a server. From then on you're welcome to do whatever you want, explore wherever you please, and play whatever game you feel up to play; No hand-holding, but complete freedom. No story to be found here.\r\n\r\nYou earn credits by playing games, which means that in theory you will technically never run out of currency as long as you just keep playing; Even being bad at them will always reward you *some* credits. These credits can then be spent on silly gimmicks such as items for your condo (yes, you have your own apartment which functions as a sort of private server for you and any friends you invite over), personal items such as clothes and glasses, or toys you can annoy your friends with such as firework launchers, a jetpack, a gun that makes bubbles, etc. That, or you can choose to gamble your credits away (or win it back!) in the Casino section of the game. As I said: Getting credits is no problem, so there's no real harm in gambling here.\r\n\r\nThis game is best approached with a mindset of relaxing and just enjoying yourself during a boring Sunday afternoon; There's no high stakes or anything, so there's very little reason to sweat. Though if you really want to sweat, there's always the leader boards to look out for.\r\n\r\nBecause of its nature as a party game, it helps to bear in mind that it does help to play with friends, though if you're determined like me you'll have no problem making your own fun as well; Even the simple arcade mini-games are surprisingly well designed and addictive. It would honestly be a Herculean task to go over every single one of them since there's so many, but just take it from me that most of them have some type of simple yet elegant skill / reward gameplay loop that makes for a fun distraction.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the multiplayer games are of course the highlight of Tower Unite and the mini golf one in particular is easily the most well-known one, and for good reason: The physics in the mini golf courses are probably the most balanced out of all of them, and the different courses show how much the creators have mastered this particular game type. I would go so far as to say that if you're into mini golf, it's worth getting Tower Unite for that alone.\r\n\r\nNow, with all that out of the way I do feel like I need to wrap this review up by addressing the elephant in the room: Yes, this game is still quite buggy and if you play this for more than several hours you'll probably have experienced accidentally clipping out of bounds at one point, but honestly it's not the worst I've ever seen and considering the scope of a title like this I can see why they might overlook some of these issues. Regardless, the game performs pretty well and only really needs time to load when entering a server or a new area (which is understandable).\r\n\r\nI do understand why some people have named Tower Unite as a game that's cursed to be forever stuck in early access, but I think it's worth looking at the bigger picture and seeing if the game is already enjoyable as it is now, and for me that's definitely a yes.", "timestamp_created": 1736885156, "timestamp_updated": 1736885156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185554536": {"recommendationid": "185554536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070336259", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 400, "playtime_at_review": 1774, "last_played": 1737345608}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty chill", "timestamp_created": 1736827819, "timestamp_updated": 1736827819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185527625": {"recommendationid": "185527625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968743222", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "playtime_at_review": 2503, "last_played": 1736792778}, "language": "english", "review": "what a stupid fun game to play with friends, not expect to pay full price for it but it can cause alot of fun moments", "timestamp_created": 1736792957, "timestamp_updated": 1736792957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185486194": {"recommendationid": "185486194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280735954", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1768, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1737081069}, "language": "english", "review": "There's an absolute boatload of things to do, even just in the plaza.

MEANWHILE, people can literally run around the plaza using their microphone to say the most racist things I've ever heard of my life, people can post furry porn in their condos, and they don't get a ban.

Welcome to Tower Unite, the multiplayer sandbox that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously\u2014and neither should you. Let\u2019s dive into this tower of madness.\n\n[b][u]Graphics: 7/10[/u][/b]\nThe visuals are solid enough, with colorful environments that scream, \u201cWe\u2019re here for a good time, not a realistic time.\u201d The characters look like they came straight out of a meme generator, and the physics can go from \u201cpassable\u201d to \u201ccomedic disaster\u201d in seconds. But honestly, who needs ultra-realism when your avatar is a penguin in sunglasses bowling a perfect strike?\n\n[b][u]Gameplay: 9/10 (Chaos Optional)[/u]\nHere\u2019s the beauty of Tower Unite: you can do almost anything. Want to gamble your virtual cash on slot machines? Go for it. Feel like bowling? Knock yourself out. Need to prove your intellectual superiority in trivia night? Good luck.\n\nIt\u2019s a mishmash of mini-games, social hangouts, and complete nonsense. Sure, some activities feel more polished than others (we\u2019re looking at you, buggy golf physics), but that\u2019s part of the charm. If you\u2019re not laughing at your own failures, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\n[b][u]Multiplayer: 10/10 (If You Don\u2019t Mind Weirdos)[/u]\nThe multiplayer aspect is Tower Unite\u2019s lifeblood. It\u2019s a playground for extroverts, introverts, and people whose avatars are inexplicably Shrek. The community is hilariously unpredictable\u2014one moment you\u2019re playing a calm game of minigolf, the next you\u2019re watching someone race around the lobby dressed as a hotdog.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re brave enough to chat with strangers, you\u2019ll find some of the weirdest, funniest, and occasionally most disturbing interactions you\u2019ve ever had online. It\u2019s like a party where everyone\u2019s a little unhinged.\n\n[b][u]Customization: 8/10[/u]\nYour condo is your canvas, and Tower Unite gives you the tools to create whatever your twisted little heart desires. Want a minimalist penthouse? Done. Prefer a chaotic nightmare filled with random objects? Go for it. The possibilities are endless, assuming you don\u2019t mind grinding for in-game currency to afford that giant inflatable flamingo you\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n\n[b][u]Mini-Games: 7/10 (When They Work)[/u]**\nThe mini-games are the core of Tower Unite. Whether it\u2019s laser tag, ball race, or the surprisingly addictive trivia, there\u2019s something for everyone. Some games are polished and satisfying, while others feel like they were coded during a particularly chaotic lunch break.\n\nBut hey, when things go wrong, it\u2019s usually hilarious. Nothing beats getting stuck in a golf cart mid-air or watching someone get yeeted out of bounds because the physics engine had a bad day.\n\n[b][u]Soundtrack: 8/10[/u]\nThe music is a vibe\u2014relaxing when it needs to be, energetic when it counts. It\u2019s like the game is saying, \u201cWe know you\u2019re here for chaos, but let\u2019s set the mood.\u201d And honestly? It works.\n\n[b][u]Final Verdict: 8/10[/u]\nTower Unite isn\u2019t perfect, but that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s chaotic, messy, and occasionally buggy, but it\u2019s also one of the most fun and unpredictable multiplayer experiences out there. Whether you\u2019re bowling strikes, gambling for that one last condo upgrade, or just laughing at the absurdity of it all, there\u2019s never a dull moment.\n\nSo grab your friends\u2014or make some new ones online\u2014and dive into the madness.
