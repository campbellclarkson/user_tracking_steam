I play offline a lot, and I kinda wish steam would track your offline hours so I could see just how much time I've sunk into my favorite games XD\n\nAnyhow! I definitely recommend this one, it's not a super challenging RTS out the gate, though it does require some learning to get the hang off (5.1 the myth the legend, I think the only case where ignoring the narrator is the only correct option to succeed. Honestly if this could be fixed to properly imply that you should only tunnel vision 1 mound during each night cycle that would probably help people. I know after I looked up what to do I can now consistently smoke extreme without sweating too hard) It's addicting in a good way to me, because I've starting getting better at the game to the point I'm actually trying to get all of the in game achievements. I have no idea how some of them are gonna be possible but I am gonna try it! Of course steam still gives me achievements regardless, but I still want the in game achievements. Just because.\n\nThis is actual one of very few games I'd love to see DLC for. Like... I have no real idea what kinda DLC that could be provided other than \"Hey! Here's like this whole other campaign you can play!\" but i'd genuinely be interested. Even just having more \"story\" scenarios with pre-existing ant types would make me happy. Like i'd like more Leafcutter maps, and Fire ant maps, even some more Matabele maps would be cool. I don't need new ants, although this game did introduce me to the Matabele which are pretty neat, but I genuinely just want more content with Leaftcutters and Fire ants (because they're my favorites IRL and in game so sue me im biased :P )\nHeck you could just give me a Campaign where I'm playing as only 1 colony  for five major missions and I'd love it.\nAlso I mean... Maybe a DLC where we get some silly continuation of the main story? honestly with that one I just want anything- a visual comic a novella, just anything. I was caught off guard and was pleasantly surprised by the ending.\nlast note- please sell the soundtrack. I'd but it in a heartbeat. I just... every Leaftcutter song lives rent free (The night one in particualr) in my brain and the Matabele's day song plays randomly during the day in my head. They're just so good!\n\nalso just an off the wall suggestion/request to the devs, I know it would be like REALLY difficult to pull off compared to an ant RTS, but maybe a bee colony? I just.... like bees and it would be interesting. maybe. again maybe a DLC, that just features a basic honey bee. I know we'd probably be missing the underground digging segments, but it could be made up for with other threats probably.

splitting groups into smaller ones for extra seconds and making creatures fight each other later into the game. 90% of all levels are races against the clock in disguise and you're never given a break, if you find yourself waiting and doing nothing during a game then there's something you're yet to be aware of, upping your difficulty should fix that.\n\nThe only complaint i have is the lack of multiplayer despite the game exploring such possibility in skirmish and extra levels and some perfomance issues, both of which are tech limitations just like in-level save systems.\n\nOh and those who say the game lacks content and replayability, BS too, half the levels are way too replayable, there's dozens of extra content, Remix mode is now a thing and there's also custom matches you can play as well as silly minigames which trigger every now and then, beta content is also released monthly and...
