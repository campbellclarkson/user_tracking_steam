Despite it's age (1996) the game is both easy to learn but it can be complex with some aspects. The controls are super basic, the army types make the game very interesting, and the random events can greatly affect how a game goes for the player with multiple rounds of Black Death or something making it very rough. All in all for the game being nearly 30 years old it is still super fun, addicting, fairly easy to pick up, cheap, and it runs well.
