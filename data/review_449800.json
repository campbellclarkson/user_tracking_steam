Swinging around and taking down Titans is super satisfying, and it never gets old.\n\nThe story mode stays true to the show, letting you relive all those epic moments while adding some cool extras. Upgrading your gear and abilities is a nice touch and makes progression feel rewarding. Multiplayer is another highlight\u2014teaming up with friends to fight Titans is a blast.\n\nThat said, one downside is the lack of mod support. It would\u2019ve been awesome to see the community expand on the game with custom content or tweaks. It doesn\u2019t ruin the experience, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind if you\u2019re big on modding.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re into Attack on Titan or just looking for a fun action game, definitely check this out.
