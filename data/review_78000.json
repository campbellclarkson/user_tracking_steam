The soundtrack also pales in comparison to that of its predecessors and overall I kind of just think I don't like looking at it or listening to it as much as I do Bejeweled 2.\n\nYou'll probably just end up playing Poker over and over and that's all you'll need the game for, so if you're looking for a relaxing Match 3 with endless gameplay, this isn't for you.", "timestamp_created": 1735081159, "timestamp_updated": 1735081159, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183581823": {"recommendationid": "183581823", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105157898", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 2526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2526, "last_played": 1709884797}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8c01\u5728\u6211\u7535\u8111\u4e0a\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e45\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1735059680, "timestamp_updated": 1735059680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 6660, "total_negative": 278, "total_reviews": 6938}, "cursors": {"AoJwxfO53ZIDeK/ApQU=": "Mon Jan 20 15:44:17 2025"}}
