This PC port is horrendous.  It's missing all of the QoL updates that the Complete edition got as well as the Afternoon of Darkness content.  The most unfortunate part is the missing QoL updates.  If you have the ability to play Complete instead of this... please do.  It's the far superior version of Disgaea 1.  This port is not good.\n\nThat being said, for those that this is their only way to play Disgaea 1... If you are a fan of the more recent Disgaea games but have never played the first few, this could be a rough play.  There were so many QoL additions made in the more recent games that are hard to give up when going back.  I had hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the PS2 version of the game and lived without these, but it's hard this time through.  I've barely even started again and can hardly justify playing this version of the game.\n\nThe mouse/keyboard controls are hot garbage.  You can remap the buttons, but that's not the issue.  If you use keyboard only, which took some adjustment for me, it's not terrible once you fix the buttons.  If, however, you want to use the keyboard AND the mouse, you're in for a real frustrating experience for a while.  The controls are very touch-screen friendly and controller friendly, but not kb/m.\n\nThe story, while not my favorite in the series, is a nice introduction to the series.  I played this several years after it's initial release but many moons ago now.  I played this before I played any of the others and fell in love with the series based on this story.  It doesn't take itself seriously and it's completely nonsensical, but that's one of the reasons Disgaea fans love the series.  Story is maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, honestly.\n\nFor a player that is new to the series, this is an even harder recommend.  If you are EVER going to play Disgaea 1, I suggest playing it first.  You will, as mentioned before, miss those basic QoL features that are added in the later games.    This game (and the others in the series) is a GRIND!  If you are just looking to complete the story, well to be honest, you're playing the wrong game.  Disgaea isn't about the story.  The story is just what you have to play through to get to the real game.  The post-game is what we're all here for.  Big number gets bigger.  Grind to get number even bigger.\n\nThe mechanics, until you understand them, are obtuse.  You can soft lock yourself on a map if you don't understand how Geo panels work.  It's all fixable, but it can be super frustrating to realize that you don't know anything that you were supposed to.  Don't sleep on geo panels and geo chains... they can be your friend. \n\nThe difficulty is... it depends on how well you learned the mechanics.  If you skipped all the dialogue because you were impatient and learned nothing, it will be more challenging.  There are a couple of difficulty spikes that can catch you off guard.  The first \"boss,\" named Mid-Boss in the level can kick your butt if you were playing with a balanced party.  You thought you were doing the right thing, leveling, you know... ALL of your party at a fairly even pace with each other and then you get to this stage (which is SUPER early, btw) and you realize that you suck at the game.  I would be willing to bet that a lot of people quit at that stage and give up on the whole series.  Just know that, if you just grind a little bit, you can get that stage completed.  And get used to that grind... you're going to be doing it A LOT!\n\nIt hurts me to not recommend this game, it really does.  But this PC port is trash.  The PC port is the only one I'm not recommending.  I really do recommend Disgaea 1 Complete on the other platforms, though.  If you're a fan of the series, this is where it all started.  It's a very different experience to the newer ones, but a worthwhile trip to the past, for sure.  For new players, do a little research and really understand the level of GRIND and the level of goofy storytelling that this series is known for and if you're still interested, Disgaea 1 is a solid game.
