All of the sudden, after trying all sorts of new stuff (from dropping the original lore in [b]Generals[/b] to turning the series into an f2p thing), [b]EA[/b] took the U-turn and went all old-school in their [b]C&C3[/b]. [b]Tiberium Wars[/b], while not being perfect, was a big surprise to old fans like me, who were ready to give up on a thing they used to love back in the days. Long story short, [b]EA[/b] took the original [b]C&C[/b] from 1995 and, well, gave us the next-gen version of it. All the advanced stuff [b]Westwood[/b] planned for their own version of [b]C&C3[/b] was dropped, but honestly, at that point it didn't matter. What mattered is that we finally got our [b]C&C[/b] back. Now they've promised us [b]Red Alert[/b] and naturally, what I expected was the same thing, but with the ships. Because that's what the original [b]RA[/b] was \u2013 same ol' [b]C&C[/b], just with the naval battles and some new features, right? Well, turned out I was wrong. Dead wrong.\n\nNaturally, [b]RA3[/b] follows the [b]RA2[/b] formula. And that is something to be expected. [b]RA2[/b], despite insulting some old-school fans, was warmly welcomed and, let's admit it, after it became a thing, there was no turning back. The original concept was no more. Shared universe, the dark tone, the alternative history... Well, maybe not the alternative history. I mean, the original 1996 game was all about \u201cWhat if?...\u201d thing, in which [b]Westwood[/b] tried to imagine the world without [b]Adolf Hitler[/b]. Naturally, with Nazi Germany and the USSR being allies (they've signed a pact and then both invaded Poland the next month), it was USSR to start the world war in [b]Westwood[/b]'s game. [b]EA[/b]? Well, they went even further back to the past. Even though it's generally considered that WWII began in 1939, in Asia it was going since 1937 (Second Sino-Japanese War), so... Yeah. We've got Japan. As a third playable faction.\n\nSounds rather smart, but like I said, don't expect anything serious here. [b]RA3[/b] is all about \u201cOMG, LOL!\u201d moments its predecessor was known for. Let's just say that Japanese forces here have a giant mecha kaij\u016b with the light swords and forget about it, OK? [b]RA3[/b] is like [b]RA2[/b] on drugs. And, like [b]Joey Tribbiani[/b], it's not even sorry. No, seriously, it takes pride in everything. [b]RA2[/b] was cheesy? [b]RA3[/b] is probably [i]the[/i] cheesiest thing in AAA gaming.[b]RA2[/b] sexualized women? [b]RA3[/b] feels like it was made by [b]Larry Laffer[/b] and [b]Vince McMahon[/b]. Et cetera, et cetera. And yes, [b]EA[/b] threw in Hollywood cast again. We've got [b]Tim Curry[/b], Japanese Emperor is played by [b]Star Trek[/b] legend [b]George Takei[/b], the American president is [b]J.K. Simmons[/b] (AKA [i]the[/i] [b]J. Jonah Jameson[/b])... Even that dumbass [b]Gina Carano[/b] is in this game, which is a nice fit for her for a change. [i]Anyway[/i]. Like I said, all that is to be expected. [b]EA[/b] liked the direction [b]RA[/b] took in the second game, they had the money... No surprise here. What shocked me was that... This game is nothing like [b]C&C3[/b]. You know what we've got instead of it? We've got [b]Generals 2[/b]. For consoles. Say wha-a-a-a-a-a-a...\n\nI'm serious, though. I wish I wasn't, but I am. You know how sometimes the main series doesn't really fit on consoles, but publisher still wants it to be represented there? They make consoles-oriented spin-off. Something like, say, [b]Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Revolution[/b]. Something that aims for consoles audience, yet still somewhat akin to what PC counterpart was about. [b]RA3[/b]? Is exactly that. While [b]C&C3[/b] was on [b]Xbox 360[/b] too, [b]RA3[/b] is also on [b]PS3[/b]. And we all know just how much \u201cfun\u201d developing things for [b]PS3[/b] was (yes, that's, most likely, why we still didn't get [b]Disgaea 3[/b] in [b]Steam[/b]). As the result... Well... [b]RA3[/b] looks like a console game, [b]RA3[/b] feels like a console game and in a nutshell, [b]RA3[/b] [i]is[/i] a console game. Tiny maps, [i]huge[/i] fonts... You know the drill. It wasn't time for [b]Dragon Age II[/b] yet, but yes, that's the stuff. Really wonder why there's no gamepad support here, because, unlike [b]C&C3[/b], this game doesn't feel natural on PC.\n\nWhich... doesn't mean that it's bad. Exactly the opposite, it's [i]incredibly[/i] fun. And that's... the worst thing about it. I'll explain why in a moment. For now, let's get back to [b]Generals[/b]. Like I already mentioned, gameplay-wise [b]EA Los Angeles[/b] didn't even try to deliver [b]RA3[/b] here. They've just gave us [b]Generals 2[/b]. We've got, well, generals again, with all of their levels and abilities back, [b]Spice[/b] / [b]Tiberium[/b] mechanics is no more and we've got [b]WarCraft[/b]-like thingy from [b]Generals[/b], we can build anywhere (with some \u201cbuts\u201d, but still), etc. Which technically does sound like an arguable decision, but the thing is \u2013 there's one thing to justify all that. That thing is co-op. The whole thing is co-op-oriented. And even if you'll decide to play solo, you'll still share the map with your AI companion. All of those [b]Generals[/b] elements were added for one single purpose \u2013 to make this game as quick and smooth as possible in co-op. See where this is going?\n\nYes, [b]RA3[/b] is one of [i]those[/i] games. At the moment I write this, all of us can name at least some series that were heavily ruined by such an approach. [b]MachineGames[/b]' [b]Wolfenstein[/b], [b]Dead Island[/b]... [b]RA3[/b], on the other hand? It won [i]a lot[/i] from it. Yes, it was all about tiny maps with not enough space for, you know, strategy. We were just teaming up in order to do some obvious tasks, but since the game was fast-paced (ish, speed slider still isn't a thing) and satisfying? It was just... Like I said, [i]fun[/i]. Up to this day, [b]RA3[/b] is one of the funniest things you can play if all you want is just some quick RTS sessions. The factions are great and unique (all three feel totally different from each other), units are surprisingly complicated and sometimes even allow us to switch between different abilities, while the UI is totally fine and won't make you break your pace. Even the single player campaign (10 missions per faction) is not that bad. Even though yes, it does suffer from [b]Generals[/b] problem, where it'll change goals on the way (which will lead to some pretty unfair surprises to you). Still, the main dish here is a co-op. It's smooth, it's fun and it's hard not to praise [b]EA LA[/b] for what they've achieved with it. Like I said, though, it was not a good thing for the series.\n\nWhy? Think about it. What we have here is a co-op oriented spin-off for consoles. Which was sold as a real deal, as a part of main series. And it sold well. People loved it. Still do (despite the original [b]GameSpy[/b]-based multiplayer being dead, there's still a third-party way to play online). Which made [b]EA[/b] to believe that... That's what people want. That this here is how the series should be in the future. Not about old-school stuff, but about fast-paced short sessions online. Most of the people blame [b]C&C4[/b] for killing the series for good. That's how they've remembered it. But the truth is \u2013 it wasn't [b]Tiberium Twilight[/b] that fired the poisoned bullet. This game did. Yet nobody hated it for that. Because it was [i]crazy[/i] fun. Now, you may ask how did my old friend felt about it? You know, the man I've mentioned in my [b]RA2[/b] review? The one we disagreed about series' new look with? Well, we'll never know. Because at the moment of 2008 he was long dead. And there's some moral in that, I guess. You never know how things will turn out the next day. [b]RA 3[/b]? It was one of them crazy turns. Worked great in a moment, but...

al Red Alert 3, ya lo termin\u00e9 en su d\u00eda y me pareci\u00f3 un juego muy divertido, ahora lo compr\u00e9 en una oferta de toda la saga por 4 euros, y lo he vuelto a jugar.\n\nMe sorprende las pocas horas que marca registradas, yo jurar\u00eda que lo he jugado bastantes m\u00e1s. Tambi\u00e9n he de decir que aunque ponga que no est\u00e1 en castellano el juego est\u00e1 completamente traducido, tanto los textos como los di\u00e1logos y las cinem\u00e1ticas. \n\nEl juego ofrece una estrategia r\u00e1pida, de pocos edificios y con una gesti\u00f3n de recursos automatizada y simple, propio de toda la saga, introduce 3 facciones, dos ven\u00edan de los juegos originales, metiendo una nueva, los japoneses. \n\nPor lo dem\u00e1s la historia se establece en un universo alternativo donde no se ha desarrollado la bomba nuclear lo cual ha generado un conflicto abierto entre aliados y sovieticos, conflicto en el que se introducen los japoneses. \n\nLa campa\u00f1a es divertida, con ese toque de la saga de meter actores reales, algunos de segunda fila, otros m\u00e1s reconocibles. En este juego se adopta un punto de vista m\u00e1s adulto en las cinem\u00e1ticas, optando por un peque\u00f1o toque de erotismo en los uniformes y los enlaces t\u00e1cticos.\n\nLo lamentable del juego es que en su inicio se pens\u00f3 como un juego cooperativo, y tanto la campa\u00f1a como el multijugador se dise\u00f1aron para jugarse entre dos personas, lo cual a mi gusto no le hace bien a la campa\u00f1a. Los escenarios de la campa\u00f1a son variados pero siempre son partidas de 2 players, la IA es inexistente en tu compa\u00f1ero al cual debes dar instrucciones concretas. El nivel de dificultad no es nada retador, por lo que el juego a d\u00eda de hoy sin multijugador acaba siendo el disfrute de jugar una campa\u00f1a para conocer la historia que propone. \n\nOtro aspecto negativo es que los gr\u00e1ficos han sufrido mucho el paso del tiempo, es curioso, porque los pixelacos de los juegos originales, 1 y 2, a d\u00eda de hoy se sienten c\u00f3modos, pero el aspecto gr\u00e1fico del 3 ha envejecido m\u00e1s que un queso puesto al sol. \n\nLo recomiendo, porque sigue siendo divertido a d\u00eda de hoy, ofrece una estrategia muy fluida, con variedad de opciones t\u00e1cticas, y una historia con un toque de humor tremendo, me encanta que parodian al presidente de estados unidos, el cual hace discursos encorsetados que en su \u00e9poca eran una satira pero que a d\u00eda de hoy son la norma del pa\u00eds.", "timestamp_created": 1736084217, "timestamp_updated": 1736084217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184827021": {"recommendationid": "184827021", "author": {"steamid": "76561199681087363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2729, "last_played": 1736099762}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Bra spel", "timestamp_created": 1736076570, "timestamp_updated": 1736076570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184810719": {"recommendationid": "184810719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360887006", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 5910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 340, "playtime_at_review": 5437, "last_played": 1737282116}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u627f\u8f7d\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u521d\u4e2d\u3001\u9ad8\u4e2d\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4ee5\u540e\u65e5\u5195\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5c06RA3\u7ee7\u627f\u4e0b\u53bb", "timestamp_created": 1736058592, "timestamp_updated": 1736058592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184799253": {"recommendationid": "184799253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417456256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3890, "deck_playtime_at_review": 4, "last_played": 1736046286}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun RTS game.

Actors are fun to watch I guess, though not exactly compelling in game. They at least look like they had fun, especially Tim Curry. Bloopers are worth tracking down, as well as the memes these performances spawned. The factions are not balanced, you'll be having a problem getting any good anti-air throughout all the campaigns, unless you're the Allies who are WAY better than the the other 2 factions combined. There's no contest. The Allies also have the best campaign out of the 3, with the most interesting missions and narrative, even if the plot progresses because your boss is an idiot. And it's the campaign where Tim Curry says \"the line\"!! \n\nThe New Japanese faction has the weakest units in the entire game because their gimmick of switching units from ground/sea to air make them extremely vulnerable if the Russians or Allies have a mix of anti-Ground/Air units, which they always do. This becomes blatantly apparent during the Japanese's Hawaii mission which gives you 3 anti-air units, the Turret (Which takes time to set up, and is easily destroyed anyway), the helicopter (Which only becomes anti-air on land, and the Allies base is specifically in the water), and the Mecha Tengu (Which are brittle, weak, and need to be in jet-mode to become anti-air). While the Allies have strong anti-air Jets, turrets and 2 different boats. And if you wanna switch you're Tengu to ground mode to protect the Battleships you get later (Which are necessary to win, believe me) they'll be massacred, along with any ships you've built, by Cryocopters, Dophins, Battleships, the same anti-air turrets and 2 boats mentioned earlier (Because they can attack air and ground units. How Novel!!), Electric towers if you get too close to their base, and Aircraft Carrier's that can infinitely spawn smaller planes that can hit anything FAAAARRR outside their own field of view... \n\nThey also just feel weird to me. Like, the game uses stereotypes for theming and characterisation, which I just think is lazy, but it's whatever. But, when it's applied to the Japanese, they end up feeling \"oriental\".
