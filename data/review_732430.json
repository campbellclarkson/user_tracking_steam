It is exactly was it looks like and I quite enjoy it. However I do have a couple ideas that would make the game more enjoyable for me.\n\n1. At high speed the controls should be more responsive and more effective. (maybe at terminal velocity you would reach 2x responsiveness and 1.5x effectiveness) This would reward fast reaction time and increase the \"flow\" of high speed flight.\n\n2. Roll rate when flying straight down has to be a lot greater. This combined with better high speed control would greatly enhance flying through vertical features, where quick pitch adjustments 180 degrees from each other are necessary.\n\n3. I know this is against the design philosophy of the game, but mouse look (or arrow keys to turn camera with a setting to swap wasd and arrow controls) would be nice not only for better gameplay but just something to do with my right hand.\n\n4. Finally, for the biggest change, it would be nice if the maps were a bit larger, so you could fly straight through long caverns for longer instead of constantly turning in circles to stay near features.", "timestamp_created": 1737195625, "timestamp_updated": 1737195625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185812933": {"recommendationid": "185812933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878519623", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1737316734}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1737151548, "timestamp_updated": 1737151548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185778698": {"recommendationid": "185778698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355786215", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1737296619}, "language": "english", "review": "satisfying", "timestamp_created": 1737117916, "timestamp_updated": 1737117916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185762335": {"recommendationid": "185762335", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995234530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1737013086}, "language": "english", "review": "A flight sim that's enjoyable casually but going for high scores by playing risky is exhilarating.

You control a character with wings by using 4 directional keys and have to fly close to walls and floors without hitting them to gain points and eventually a combo. Every map is procedurally generated but you can input seeds, similar to Minecraft. This helps with grinding achievements. (Crashing 300 times takes a while though, since I only got to around 130 by playing casually, but it's not too hard.)\n\nThis game is only $3 dollars but honestly I'd pay more for it. The controls are hard but it feels like a good learning curve. It requires you to aim turns earlier than it seems like you would, in a gradual \"gliding\" sort of motion. Once you get the hang of it, It's really fun. It's a pretty relaxing game and there's a zen mode too. It just makes it so there's no popup for the points or combos.\n\nFor completionists such as myself, it only took a little over 2 and a half hours to get all of the achievements. I did spend a lot of time going for difficult paths and scores, so you could probably finish it in about 2 hours. So, I'd definitely recommend this game.
