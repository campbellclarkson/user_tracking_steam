I also turtled and just did missions until i bought my army and then went on my rampage i didnt do it gradual. that was just my prefered way to play it.\nWould i recommend it to others. yes. I like the fleet battles. I do not like not being able to see half my ships firing their weapons even tho i know they are using them unless im within 4000 more often then i would like but i can live with it. \nGame is worth your time. I do recommend playing SG2 before playing it but likely fine if you dont. \nSG3 before playing, no game is freelancer clone (for gameplay a very good one) which isnt a bad thing and the characters will annoy you everyone is an a *ole friends and enemies alike and the drone missions wish could skip still was a good game for what it was.\nso thats it. an honest review.
