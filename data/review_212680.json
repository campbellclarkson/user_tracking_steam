I've played for around 200 hours on my old account and I had not gotten bored once. While I don't play FTL that much nowadays, it's one of those games that has had such an impact on me as a person it actively shaped me at least a little bit to who I am today. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay is simple, effective and fun. You have to travel to a variety of locations, some of which will see your Vessel boarded by pirates, Have you ambushed by Mantis or Slavers or worst of all.... you find a station with giant alien spiders. The fights themselves are, in my opinion, phenomenal and one of a kind. Of course you have your trade offs, you sacrifice someone who is stationed at the engine so that he can go to weapons, or you move two of your guys and gals from the Cameras or doors to your teleporter and settle things close and personal. The weapons are no joke either, almost all of them are completely viable (almost). My favourites are the Laser machine gun (I think it was called Vulcan?), The Fire beam and by by by far the glaive beam and the anti-bio beam. \r\n\r\nThe way you unlock new \"outfits\" and ships is also smart. Connected to events and challenges, my own personal favourite being the Lanius ship (I love the idea of the Lanius as a race in general) and the Federation cruiser. If I had one complaint in this department, it's that some ships are lacking or the event to unlock them is more fun that it is playing with them, like the stealth cruiser or (if i remember correctly) all 3 of the zoltan cruisers. But that is to be expected from such a variety, some ships are just better than others.\r\n\r\nThe world building? Immaculate. Muah, chef's kiss, 11/10. It's a self contained story, small and maybe inconsequential but it d o e s immerse you. And with the Series \"Kestrel Adventures\" (one of the most ambitious fan projects i've ever watched and had the pleasure to watch before it was over) you get a much deeper appreciation for the game. Though take my opinion with a grain of salt as I was raised with this game and I could have some rose tinted nostalgia glasses on. But for the life of me, when I started writing, I absolute loved the Zoltan and the Lanius as races. Living energy who power everything around them and living robots who eat scrap metal to survive, so advanced they suck the oxygen out of everything and have their own languages. Personally? I LOVE the Lanius, i'd go out of my way to play with their cruiser.\r\n\r\nThe music? Boy, if the world building and game play were good, this is leagues above it. The main menu music is THE stuff, I remember a friend back in 2020 being sick and tired and I told him \"Open up FTL, listen to the menu music and go to dream land.\". He did. And since then we've BOTH been nostalgic, despite he himself not being a fan of these strategic games. There's some who don't really slap but really that's like, 10%, you'll be vibing your way through sector 5 like there's a rave. \r\n\r\nReplayability is also a factor FTL excels on. It's designed to be played ad infinitum, with different races and weapons to try out, not to even mention drones, hacking and what not. No complaints here. \r\n\r\nAll in all - The game is awesome. But I do have one complaint, which is major but in no way a deal breaker. It's very, very hard to access the \"DLC\", and if someone doesn't have some outside source of knowledge about it, they wouldn't know it existed. It's such an RNG fest that I dedicated 10 hours in my old account and still never got to find the crystal biome in and of itself, much less the cruiser. I never even got to see the crystal man himself. But as i said, far from a game ender. \r\n\r\nIn short -\r\nGraphics: 10/10, style over graphics all the way\r\nMusic: 11/10\r\nGameplay: 9/10\r\nReplayability: 10/10\r\n\r\nAll in all, the perfect game to pour your heart on.
