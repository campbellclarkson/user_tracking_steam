The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is one of those games. Released in 2002, Morrowind forever changed the world of open-world RPGs, offering an unparalleled sense of freedom, immersion, and depth that has rarely been matched since. It\u2019s a game that transports you to a world brimming with mystery, intrigue, and adventure, where every corner hides something to discover, and where your choices carry weight in shaping the outcome of the story.\r\n\r\nA World Like No Other\r\nMorrowind is a game that thrives on its setting. The island of Vvardenfell, where the game takes place, is a land like no other in the realm of fantasy gaming. It\u2019s a world of alien landscapes, bizarre creatures, and ancient cultures that feel alive and rich with history. The landscape is vast and varied, from the craggy, volcanic ashlands of Red Mountain to the lush, swampy forests of the Bitter Coast. Whether you\u2019re traversing the desolate wastelands, exploring ancient ruins, or uncovering the secrets of long-forgotten temples, every area of Morrowind feels uniquely crafted, each location brimming with its own atmosphere, history, and dangers.\r\n\r\nThe attention to detail in the world-building is astonishing. NPCs go about their lives, offering clues and lore that deepen the immersion, and factions with their own motives and ideologies provide layers of political intrigue. The culture of the Dunmer (Dark Elves) and their complex history with the Tribunal gods and their ancient enemies is explored through conversations, quests, and exploration. This is a world where every corner you turn presents a new mystery, a new story to uncover, and no stone is left unturned when it comes to its lore.\r\n\r\nImmersive Role-Playing Freedom\r\nWhat sets Morrowind apart from many of its contemporaries is the sheer freedom it offers. You\u2019re not guided down a linear path, and the game doesn\u2019t hold your hand. The main quest is there for those who wish to follow it, but the beauty of Morrowind lies in its open-ended nature. You can go anywhere, talk to anyone, and explore the world on your terms. The game doesn\u2019t force you into combat or story beats\u2014you are the architect of your own adventure. Want to become a master of magic, joining the Mages Guild and unraveling the mysteries of arcane power? Or would you prefer to wield your sword, joining the Fighter\u2019s Guild and advancing through its ranks? Perhaps you\u2019d rather deal in subtlety, joining the Thieves Guild or even becoming a full-fledged assassin in the Dark Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe character creation and progression system in Morrowind is deep and rewarding. You can customize your character\u2019s skills, attributes, and race in a way that allows for a truly unique playthrough. Each choice you make feels impactful, and every path offers different rewards and challenges. The combat system is challenging yet rewarding, with a real emphasis on character skill, making each battle feel like a personal test of your abilities. It\u2019s a game where every decision has consequences, whether you\u2019re deciding whom to trust, which faction to join, or how to approach the sprawling array of quests.\r\n\r\nA Rich and Complex Story\r\nWhile the sheer freedom of Morrowind is intoxicating, the main quest is nothing short of legendary. Centered around the return of an ancient prophecy and the rise of a hero destined to defeat a dark god, the story of Morrowind is layered with political intrigue, ancient myths, and moral dilemmas. The main quest is supported by dozens of side stories and lore-rich quests that offer insight into the world\u2019s cultures, conflicts, and mysteries.\r\n\r\nBut what truly makes the story of Morrowind special is its sense of personal agency. You\u2019re not just a passive observer in this world\u2014you are at the center of everything. Your choices shape the course of the story, and your interactions with factions and characters have lasting effects. Do you side with the Tribunal, the revered god-kings of the Dark Elves, or do you seek to destroy them to bring about the rise of a new order? It\u2019s a game that constantly forces you to question your beliefs, your loyalties, and your place in this world.\r\n\r\nVisuals, Sound, and Atmosphere\r\nFor a game released in 2002, Morrowind was ahead of its time in terms of atmosphere and design. The art direction is fantastical and otherworldly, with architecture, landscapes, and creatures that feel both alien and strangely familiar. The game is not about stunning realism, but about creating a distinct, memorable world, and it succeeds at that in spades.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack, composed by Jeremy Soule, is iconic. Its sweeping, orchestral score adds a sense of gravitas to every moment, whether you're adventuring across the vast wilderness or delving into the dark, eerie depths of ancient ruins. The music resonates with the themes of exploration, mystery, and the unknown, becoming as much a part of the game\u2019s identity as the world itself.\r\n\r\nA Legacy That Endures\r\nThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is not just a game\u2014it\u2019s a world, a living, breathing entity that has captivated players for over two decades. It\u2019s a game where you can lose yourself for hours, discovering new secrets, building your character, and shaping your own destiny. It offers an experience that is rare in modern gaming\u2014one that combines depth, freedom, and storytelling in a way that feels timeless.\r\n\r\nEven now, Morrowind stands tall as one of the best RPGs ever made. Its influence can be seen in many modern open-world games, but few manage to capture the same sense of wonder, depth, and freedom. It\u2019s a game that dares you to immerse yourself fully in its world, and in return, it rewards you with an experience that stays with you long after you\u2019ve put down the controller.\r\n\r\nConclusion: A Timeless Classic\r\nMorrowind is the epitome of what makes RPGs great\u2014an immersive world, a deep and customizable character system, a compelling narrative, and the freedom to explore, create, and decide your own fate. It\u2019s a game that stands the test of time, a masterpiece that remains as captivating today as it was when it was first released. If you haven\u2019t experienced Morrowind, you owe it to yourself to journey to Vvardenfell and uncover its secrets.

Many people who play this will probably just quit after wandering around outside for five minutes, eventually dying to a mudcrab or a kwama forager do to not being able to land a single hit with their starting dagger while at 0 fatigue and a Short Blade skill level of 5. While Morrowind's mechanics are not overly complicated in retrospect, there is a bit of a learning curve in figuring out how to create a viable character, level up, and actually engage in combat. \n\nUnlike later Elder Scrolls games, your character in Morrowind lacks a lot of the quality of life features that players in later games may take for granted. You cannot run at full speed or constantly jump without deleting your Fatigue (which in turn makes you less effective in combat/skills), every weapon strike and spell casting is subject to a percent chance to fail based on your skill levels and attributes, fast travel is limited to specific NPCs that operate travel services, many enemies in the open world are NOT scaled to your level and can be incredibly powerful if you stumble across them early on, and there are NO quest markers--just text instructions in your journal that vaguely tell you where to go or who to talk to.\n\nThis sort of gameplay appeals to many players, while turning others away.  Some may consider the RPG combat mechanics to be less immersive, while seeing the quest and fast travel limitations as more immersive than later titles. I've always liked the very deep level of customization allowed in the game. Morrowind lets you craft your own custom spells with almost no limitations other than your own character's skill level, gives you immense freedom with enchanting gear, has a huge number of gear slots, has an impressive variety of spell effects ranging from useless/niche to broken, and allows spell effects and stats to scale up virtually without limit. You can, for instance, go from barely being able to run faster than a crawl to being able to jump across the entire world in a single bound. Morrowind scaling is crazy.\n\nA large part of the appeal of Morrowind also comes from the setting and story. The world has a very alien feeling, with giant mushroom trees, and poison jellyfish cows, dinosaurs, tower-sized bug taxis, and so on. And the cultural dynamic is quite unique compared to other fantasy settings. You really do feel like an outsider in a relatively hostile land that you need to earn your place in. There are complex faction dynamics, race relations, cultural clashes, and a story that I think sets it apart from the setting and narrative of later ES titles like Oblivion and Skyrim.\n\nMorrowind isn't a game for everyone.

Vvardenfell \u00e8 un mondo ricco di cultura, storia e mistero, con paesaggi unici e una variet\u00e0 di creature che stimolano l'esplorazione. La libert\u00e0 offerta al giocatore \u00e8 notevole, permettendo di intraprendere una vasta gamma di missioni e di sviluppare il proprio personaggio in modi diversi.\n\nTuttavia, ci sono alcuni aspetti che ho trovato meno soddisfacenti. Il sistema di combattimento, ad esempio, pu\u00f2 risultare macchinoso e poco intuitivo, rendendo gli scontri meno fluidi rispetto a titoli pi\u00f9 recenti. Inoltre, l'interfaccia utente e il sistema di gestione dell'inventario possono apparire datati e poco user-friendly, soprattutto per chi \u00e8 abituato a standard pi\u00f9 moderni.\n\nUn altro punto critico riguarda le prestazioni tecniche. Anche su hardware moderno, il gioco pu\u00f2 presentare rallentamenti e problemi di compatibilit\u00e0, richiedendo spesso l'uso di mod o configurazioni specifiche per garantire un'esperienza di gioco stabile. \n\nNonostante questi difetti, Morrowind rimane un titolo di grande importanza nella storia dei giochi di ruolo, capace di offrire un'avventura profonda e coinvolgente a chi \u00e8 disposto a superare le sue complessit\u00e0.

I'm currently nearly done with the main quest, and will be getting started on the DLCs and the modded content fairly soon.\n\nMy playtime on steam says 91 minutes. That's wrong. My main save (at time of writing) has around 40 hours of playtime on it. This is because I'm playing on OpenMW, and I need to be clear:\n[b] You will not play this game through steam. [/b]\nYou will buy it on steam, but you will either be using MWSE or OpenMW to run the game. Those 90 minutes I spent on the base game were buggier than launch skyrim, because this is an old game. There's nothing wrong with using OpenMW to get modern resolutions, good framerates, and no crashes.\n\nI've played this game with a very long modlist, around 50gb of content on it. This includes all of Project Tamriel (that's currently out), and a couple of rebalance mods. I don't think there's anything wrong with playing the game like this the first time around, especially because these mods aren't really changing the core of the game, the combat system, or the main quest. \n\nEveryone in current day is playing Skyrim with a modlist, at the least, Enairim, and likely Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. If that game gets the benefit of the doubt with mods, Morrowind gets it absolutely. \n\n[h1] quality of life in a 20 year old game [/h1]\nMorrowind is infamous for having scuffed combat, limited fast travel, slow movement, heavy fog, no skill tree / perk system, and kooky quests, by today's standards. How much of this impacts you to this day?\n\nFor the combat, I'm not having trouble. I decided early on to go Destruction / Conjuration mage, so I've been having a fairly easy time of it. Random chance to fail casting my spells is much more manageable than random chance to fail using a weapon, and I think I would recommend mage in Morrowind based on my experience. When it comes to using weapons, make sure to select \"auto use best attack\", as like Mount & Blade, you have different attacks based on the direction you're moving in combat. A spear, for example, is pretty bad at swinging, but great at stabbing. Clicking that option, you'll always stab with the spear.\n\nFast Travel is probably my big thing. I loathe unlimited fast travel, because in Skyrim, this quickly becomes \"fast travel to this ruin and walk five minutes\". You end up missing a lot of the world. In Skyrim, I always make sure to use carriages and boats where possible, and abstain from (most) fast travel outside of that. In Morrowind, there's no fast travel except that system - silt striders, boats, and Guild Guides are your main way of getting around. I like the system, but it can be frustrating. Here's some tips on how to deal with it:\n- Use an online map. This is useful in general for Morrowind, as many characters say \"it's east of these ruins\", but not tell you where the ruins are. This lets you see which cities you need to taker a strider to before wasting any gold.\n- Use Mark & Recall. I'll confess, I've not been doing this at all in my playthrough, because I've been getting by on the other tips.\n- Use alteration magic. If you're a mage, crafting your own Jump spells can very quickly become the fastest way of getting around. This is true in Enairim as well.\n- Use Scrolls of Divine / Almsivi Intervention. These take you to the nearest Imperial or Tribunal temple, mostly in nearby cities or forts, and can be especially useful when leaving ruins or Ashlander Camps, which are normally a distance away from the nearest City.\n- This is maybe controversial, but get the mod \"Alteration Movement\". Morrowind, in the later game and if you need to ever speak to a Telvanni, requires you learn the spell \"Levitate\", or carry around a bunch of potions for it. This mod simply lets you levitate on command by double jumping, rather than keeping a spell around at all times. This is especially helpful when you cast a 30 second Levitate spell, for only 10 seconds of movement, and you just float around the damn place afterwards.\n\nThere's very little voice acting in this game. There is a lot of reading. Whether you're OK with this or not depends on you. I would suggest that you should give it a go, and that once you get truly immersed in the mysteries of the Dwemer, Red Mountain and Tribunal, I don't think the reading is as much of a barrier.\n\n\"Quest Design is Hard\" Should be the motto of Bethesda. I don't really have much to say, there are some terrible quests in this game, and some ones that, in a modern game, would suck, but in this one, feel OK. I'm not going to say \"old game good\" here, sometimes there just isn't enough information given to the player, and I feel that will depend on who's playing the game. If you ever get stuck, just consider consulting UESP. Consider it a daedric artefact that gives you unlimited knowledge on Vvardenfell. \n\nThere are no quest markers. This depends on the quest, sometimes this is really frustrating, other times your third eye opens and you think \"i have to follow their directions!\"\nThis isn't universally good or bad, I'm very mixed on this topic. This is why I advise you keep UESP around you, because if you can't find something, and you've searched as best as you can, there's no shame in just wanting to continue with the actual quest.\n\nSometimes, you can't take five steps in Vvardenfell without a stupid rat, kwama forager, pterodactyl lookin ass (i refuse to learn it's name), or guar trying it's very best to stunlock you. Genuinely, this is my biggest complaint with the game, fuck these guys. At least in Skyrim, most of this kind of encounter can be avoided, and they get less common as you level up, but here? I'm sick of being stunlocked by five helldivers shriekers who would die in a single fireball, and deal no damage to me, but for some reason can hit me from anywhere. Drive them extinct.\n\n[h1] the main quest [/h1]\nI am not finished with the main quest. I already think it is among the single greatest experiences I've had in video games. There is nothing like actually uncovering secrets that you, an outlander, know nothing about, and genuinely having to piece together in your own head what happened in the past, and what didn't. It feels like an archaeologist made this game with how much the main story got me thinking.\n\nThere's enough intrigue in the main story for a Skyrim player to latch onto, at least, I think. The Main story is, for a moment, tied into the mysteries surrounding the Dwemer, and if you play the Mage's Guild, this is only more apparent. This was the hook that got me so deep into the main quest, and every time I get sick of it, some baller dialogue pulls me back in.\n\nI do have my problems. Main quest dungeons feel too long, there are stretches of the main quest (Third and Fourth trial) that are too long, with poor quest design, That aside, I have really loved this so far, and now I understand why it's held in such high regard, [spoiler] especially after speaking to Vivec [/spoiler]. \nI'm not going to compare this to Skyrim's main quest. They were ten years apart, literally made in different eras of RPGs, and the amount of writing and detail Morrowind is able to get in despite having less tools to do it is frankly an unfair comparison. whoops. i guess i compared them there.\n\n[h1] final thoughts [/h1]\nI love Morrowind already. The highs are as high as Skyrim, and the lows as low, for me. It took more getting used to, but that's a happy coincidence, as far as I'm concerned, given how foreign everything on Vvardenfell is to every other TES game. \n\nYou're on the store page, you're reading reviews. You've likely played Skyrim, more than once, and are considering doing Oblivion or Morrowind. I should know, I was in the same boat. I think Morrowind is worthy. Of your time, investment, and of stealing so many of my thoughts when I'm not playing it.\n\nMorrowind is worth it. It's worth the effort. You won't think about RPGs in the same way again, especially if you're a skyrim baby like me.", "timestamp_created": 1736085685, "timestamp_updated": 1736085685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316417217254639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184824457": {"recommendationid": "184824457", "author": {"steamid": "76561199143848896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6986, "last_played": 1735037898}, "language": "english", "review": "the only tes game", "timestamp_created": 1736073961, "timestamp_updated": 1736073961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184805283": {"recommendationid": "184805283", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126911099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1699714647}, "language": "english", "review": "I just think it's on the rocks", "timestamp_created": 1736052662, "timestamp_updated": 1736052662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184803552": {"recommendationid": "184803552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331786585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 9586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1453, "playtime_at_review": 8133, "last_played": 1737383145}, "language": "english", "review": "Bethesda at their best.\n\nStill great today.

It doesn't feel as big as it once did, but still features a varied map that requires actual thought to navigate.  You have to reference your journal for directions and check road signs in order to get around.  I've even started a OneNote page in order to keep some of my own notes and screenshots as necessary.  This may sound like a pain, but it actually adds to the immersion in a way.  \n\nThe mechanics are dated, for sure, but not in a ways that make it unplayable.  There are many indie games today that employee similar mechanics, but they're called quirky or streamlined.  If you understand the way the game is calculating things such as hit chance, then the animations and mechanics make more sense and become acceptable. \n\nFrom a visual standpoint, I'm actually very impressed by how this looks when using the OpenMW engine.  I'm not using any additional mods, but the new engine really gives the game a look that is easy for me to accept today.  Widescreen support goes a long way, but better fluidity and some added visual flairs to lighting and water help as well.  The game also includes some cool touches I had forgotten from a visual standpoint.  Upon entering Ald'ruhn for the first time, I noticed my character was blocking their face due to a sandstorm.  If you turn their back to the storm, they drop their arm; a really cool detail for a game of this vintage.  The game's music is as classic as the other Elder Scrolls games.\n\nAll in all, I'm really excited to be playing this one again.

The start of the game is bland and difficult no sugarcoating it. Spells will fail. You will miss a lot even with decent weapon skill albeit much less. Your most important decision is at the very start of the game. The racial/sex and sign bonuses are frankly ridiculous. Be careful choosing those because you may find your starting attributes to be in the dumps. My advice after that is to pick everything based on what skills you will actually use since this is not oblivion and the leveling system actually works. You can't really mess up your level ups because there are trainers and it doesn't hardlock your attribute increases on level up like in oblivion. You can have suboptimal starting attributes for your build that will need several levels of catching up to do however which is something to be wary of.\n\n-Combat. The worst. Stab thing, chug potions for stamina/health, stab some more, miss more than you hit, or use limited magic resources. It's more managing inventory/resources than actually fighting skillfully. It's jank and not very satisfying. There is a way to break that mold with enchanting but you will need money (few thousand) and some decent soulgems/items.\n\n-Exploration. Sucks. I know about the 'fast travel' systems like mages guild and silt striders but getting around still sucks. If you go by foot you move at a snails pace without the boots of blinding speed or a high starting speed stat (beast races + steed). I originally was going to play without metagaming but honestly it just feels bad when most of your playtime is mostly just walking around. As for things you can find there are some interesting minidungeons like dwemer ruins but other than that it's a whole lot of cliffracers, rats, slaughterfish and mudcrabs it feels like. \n\nLike:\n\n-Story and worldbuilding. Is pretty good. Despite the lack of voiceacting the world is actually pretty interesting, npcs can have some interesting things to say and you can find lore if you look for it. It definitely feels fantasy world and alien with some mature/silly topics sprinkled in. \n\n-Magic. Is your problem-solver. There is some very cool magic in this game and you can make your own spells/enchants if you have the gold. Even if you aren't a mage build you can be a pseudomage by using the enchanting system (no skill or mana necessary) which I highly recommend because those spells don't fail and the enchantments recharge not to mention that there is not much of a casting time. Highly recommend enchanting a ring or something with levitate to make getting around much easier.\n\n-Fixed loot. The loot you get is typically proportional to the risk you take to get it. You don't get random level scaled loot. You can go to high level areas at low levels and get good gear. There is often 'hidden' loot which is a reward for being perceptive and looking around. Unexpected powerful loot you discovered can be a pleasant surprise. You will find yourself wanting to go into the minidungeons to have a chance at finding something good.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735593709, "timestamp_updated": 1735716331, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505082905292510986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184249880": {"recommendationid": "184249880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259541788", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2742, "last_played": 1735516173}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bien", "timestamp_created": 1735588300, "timestamp_updated": 1735588300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184214586": {"recommendationid": "184214586", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048059400", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1735685892}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay is a bit slow at first, but after you finish those 'fetching' quests, the quests become more interesting and rewarding", "timestamp_created": 1735562030, "timestamp_updated": 1735562030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184191083": {"recommendationid": "184191083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121053173", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2964, "last_played": 1735710139}, "language": "english", "review": "Grew up playing this on Dad's OG Xbox.

I used OpenMW and 2 QOL mods to rebalance the movement and jump speeds, and one to not use up stamina while walking at full speed because I didn't want to spend hours upon hours going even slower than a snails pace, pushing half way on the controller thumbstick, just so that I would have stamina to spare if a fight broke out.\n\nI also cranked the difficulty down half way to the left on the slider. It's a single player game. I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone. I just want to have a good time. I also used a map to see which fast travel methods connect to each city or town on the map. It made navigating those systems bearable. And also I used UESP to find out where locations and NPCs were at, because I have ADHD and it was not fun to be pulling out the journal every 5 seconds to re-read the names of people and places I was looking for.\n\nWhile this game was a ton of fun, I still greatly prefer the more modern titles like Oblivion and Skyrim for how much easier they are to play. But I will say this, if this game doesn't click for you, try again later sometime. It might click eventually, and it might not.
