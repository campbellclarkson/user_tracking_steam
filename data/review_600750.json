I really really like this game. This game is similar to Cookie Run: Kingdom for anyone who's familiar with it. (except this game doesn't crash every 10 minutes like cookie run does)\r\n\r\nIn this game, you're the captain. Q shows up like- \"Captain! I need your help! Time's all weird again and different timelines are collapsing in on each other and no one knows what's going on except for me but I won't help you\" or something like that and now you're PR for the new galaxy.\r\n\r\nThere is a gatcha system and microtransactions if you're wary of those. \r\n\r\nHERE'S THE FUN PART:\r\nYou answer distress calls and put together an away team like in TNG. You choose 3 members of your crew based on their skills and traits. There are also choices that affect the overall story (like who to direct your support to in episode 1 of the story; the klingons or the augments). The away team levels play out like an episode of TNG.\r\n\r\nAnd the characters you obtain aren't limited to one show or movie. For example, I have both Captain Picard and Captain Sisko.\r\n\r\nI have not spent a dime on this game, and I enjoy it a great deal.
