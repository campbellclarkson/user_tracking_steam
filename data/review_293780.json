At the start of the game you choose your monster, spawn in and everyone as humans fight each-other to the death. The one who wins is the hero doing the dungeon diving. Everyone else gets to be ghosts that can haunt things (traps, throwable objects etc.), summon slimes or summon oneself as the monster form they chose- in certain areas. There's a store for the hero to interact with and every time you go deeper into the dungeon you gain points to level up your monsters- the hero getting the least and the person losing the most getting the most points to level up. At level 10 you can fight the boss to try to earn your victory against other players. Its incredibly fun and you should give it a shot.\n\nThat being said I do not recommend playing online through remote play, every time you go through a door to another room it lags, badly, I think this is steams fault and less so the games but whose to say. This ruins the natural cycle of the game-loop this game is, you can do things to make it work but its frustrating, unfair and just not worth it. \n\nAn amazing couch co-op game, but not accessibly playable online (unless everyone who's playing is on the same wifi but even then there's a bit of lag). I can only hope the devs do an update for online multiplayer, or that they make a completely new game for online players (still with the ability to couch co-op), that has more monsters, maybe some kind of rng loot rooms with deadlier traps (depending on the loot) and maybe rng stats for heroes so its not just the monsters getting stronger (although the shop already goes crazy and ofc you want the monsters to be stronger, so that everybody gets the chance to play as the hero). They could do a ton of really cool stuff with this games base concept. \n\nTLDR: AMAZING COUCH CO-OP GAME BUT BAD REMOTE PLAY- if you're thinking of getting this for online multiplayer, don't.
