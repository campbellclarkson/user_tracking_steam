This is largely but not purely based on damage dealt, but generally being roductive attacking the enemy is by far the best moneymaker. Assisting lance and team consistently can also add up to quite a few more match score, which means more c-bills and more XP for your mech variant.\r\n\r\nThe game has hundreds of mechs to try out each of which functions somewhat like a character class and each having an optimal loadout but many variants have enough flexibility to have numerous loadouts. It can be very overwhelming to start out as a new player when trying to buy your first mech, it's a good idea to seek out opinions of others as at least a starting point.\r\n\r\nOne of the game's unfortunate quirks is that it runs on a very old version of Cryengine (which is not very multicore optimized), meaning almost inescapable framerate drops on certain maps and in certain areas, at least briefly. \r\n\r\nA second quirk is that it doesn't handle bluetooth headsets particularly well. I recommend having one device to use as a microphone and a second device to use as a headphone (ie disable the mic on your BT headset if you are going to use it).\r\n\r\nOh, and the UI can't be scaled, text will likely be hard for you to read on a 4K display. Recommend playing at lower resolution as a workound if it's unbearable for you.\r\n\r\noverall MWO is an excellent choice for online multiplayer FPS, let alone free to play online multiplayer FPS.\r\n\r\nThe game's further development is funded purely based on its in-game store sales (afaik), so I'm not afraid to spend a little bit here and there even though I don't need it to enjoy the game (at all).

Now rebranded as \"Legends\" - because the Pig, in all its spite and avarice, seeks to suppress the truth: there is a better online PvP robo-stompy game.\r\n\r\nMechwarrior: Living Legends is a free combined-arms game built on Crysis Wars, set in the Battletech universe - with playable Tanks, Hovercraft, Power-Armour infantry, VTOLs and Aerospace Fighters in addition to mechs. \r\n\r\nIts main mode is Terrain Control - similar to Domination but on much larger and more varied maps, with respawns, and a per-round economy system - as well as Assault, a semi-linear attack/defend mode. If you've ever played Squad, Project Reality or Battlefield - it's that, but Battletech.\r\n\r\n There are also single-life events and organised games of TC, hosted by the community; a practice server so you can try everything out with other players, and Solaris Arena which is FFA deathmatch.\r\n\r\nIt has 46 Mech chassis, 20 vehicle chassis, 4 VTOL and 8 ASF - each with 6-8 different variants - ranging from Lights to Assaults; Brawlers, stealth bastards and rangelets, and everything in between. \r\n\r\nNo mechlab - and if you've ever got sick of seeing laser boat after lurm boat after gauss boat in MWO - you will, perhaps begrudgingly, understand this is for the best. If there's a specific role you want to play, there are multiple assets that can do it for you.\r\n\r\nThere's no grind, there's no rank system, and there are no microtransactions - all mech (and other vehicle) skins are free, and you just earn C-bills throughout the round to buy heavier assets later in the round.\r\n\r\nUse your favourite search engine, hope to see you there.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736724533, "timestamp_updated": 1736724533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524900853633880615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185474864": {"recommendationid": "185474864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198556649403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1736721716}, "language": "english", "review": "this could be the best game of all time and i wouldn't know it, the amount of bullshit you have to do just to sign up for a fucking account is fucking ridiculous \nfuck this stupid game, fuck this stupid company, and fuck 3rd party registrations", "timestamp_created": 1736721817, "timestamp_updated": 1736721817, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185470277": {"recommendationid": "185470277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862839091", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "playtime_at_review": 4159, "last_played": 1736720297}, "language": "english", "review": "god i love this game and community.", "timestamp_created": 1736716957, "timestamp_updated": 1736716957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185444105": {"recommendationid": "185444105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044609459", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 25994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2409, "playtime_at_review": 25164, "last_played": 1736982263}, "language": "english", "review": "Come for the mechs and insane customization options, stay for the chill community\r\n\r\nLegit a nice bunch of people out there with wild community event ideas, highly recommend giving it a shot and not be shy about checking sup out there", "timestamp_created": 1736694331, "timestamp_updated": 1736694331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185441268": {"recommendationid": "185441268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085995316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1736691907}, "language": "czech", "review": "20 mins searching for match?
