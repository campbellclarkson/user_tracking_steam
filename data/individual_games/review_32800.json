While Frodo and Aragorn are busy saving the world, you and your companions are tasked with battling Sauron\u2019s forces in the titular northern regions. This game offers a fresh perspective, focusing on the side battles that contribute to the larger war.\n\nWar in the North is an action RPG, combining fast-paced combat with light role-playing elements. The gameplay involves taking on waves of Orcs, Trolls, and other creatures of Mordor while leveling up your character and choosing new abilities. Each of the three heroes has unique skills: Eradan excels at archery and stealth, Andriel wields magical powers, and Farin smashes through enemies with brute strength. Their quest? Stop Sauron\u2019s lieutenant, Agandaur, who\u2019s evil but not memorable enough to get his own movie cameo. The story is serviceable, but it leans heavily on Middle-earth lore to keep you invested. Expect a lot of \u201cDid you catch that reference?\u201d moments.\n\nThe combat system is simple yet satisfying, offering a mix of melee, ranged, and magic attacks. However, the repetition of enemy encounters and limited attack variety can make the gameplay feel monotonous over time. With friends, it\u2019s a chaotic, Orc-smashing blast. Without friends, it\u2019s an exercise in patience as your AI companions display the strategic brilliance of a headless chicken.\n\nThe game\u2019s environments capture the dark and rugged tone of Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth. From snowy mountain peaks to Orc-infested dungeons, the settings feel authentic, even if they lack the polish of other AAA titles. The character models and animations, however, are somewhat dated, even for its 2011 release.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: War in the North is an enjoyable, if flawed, entry into the Lord of the Rings gaming universe. It doesn\u2019t reach the heights of more polished RPGs, but it provides enough action, lore, and cooperative gameplay to keep fans of Middle-earth engaged.", "timestamp_created": 1736000703, "timestamp_updated": 1736000763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536191165447235107", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184404610": {"recommendationid": "184404610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839279899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1241, "last_played": 1735797790}, "language": "english", "review": "This has become a family favorite game.
