Crashes are very frequent and I'd say almost completely prevent you from playing in the hardest settings which only save at the end of the day. End of the day tends to crash one times out of three even on a very good system so unless you have the patience to deal with that and loosing what could be an extremely good day out then, don't try it.\nEnemy turns are way too slow compared to any other game of this style. This needs to be (and hopefully will) be addressed in a patch.\nTutorials are a joke. Information is not provided when it should be. (End game conditions are met but you are not informed they are, allies can die at a certain date when you have never heard about them at all etc.)\nIf you can look past the jankiness and have the patience to stick with the game then you can find your fun.\nIt is, after all, a great representation of what the apocalypse would look like under these conditions: The risks are balanced with reward, the drudgery of every day life in the shelter are plainly visible and the messages you can gather in the field left by the remnant of society are interesting. (However, the hacking minigame is bad and needs to be reworked)\nThere is a distinct lack of feeling of overpowerness at the end of the game that may piss off some of us. (I had a character with maxed stats and the best gear in the game that felt like it wasn't doing any better than some of the best enemies). I would argue it's a good thing because then you still have to play the game until the end but, once again, one could counterargue that in the end game you have to fight 10 to 1 so, hey?\nOverall, I'm glad I checked guides early to complete the whole game and all the achievements in one go because even though I've enjoyed the game, the last 50% of it were such a chore, I'm never revisiting this ever again.\nOh and the game definitely needs an ending. There is none. One paragraph of white text on black background is an apology from EA not a suitable ending to a game.\n\nEdited because I can't spell...", "timestamp_created": 1736604131, "timestamp_updated": 1736604190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183592216": {"recommendationid": "183592216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120689178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1735068356}, "language": "english", "review": "I choose to not refund it, hoping that the devs will hire somebody else to fix it.
