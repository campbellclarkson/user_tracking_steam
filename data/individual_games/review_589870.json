Meanwhile, in a distant dimension, the invincible Bloons were finding themselves in a desperate struggle as the monkeys of BTD6 rose with one accord and a united uprising. As chaos erupted across dimensions, a strange alignment of purpose began to take shape.\r\n\r\nGordon Freeman had taken on everything from alien swarms to interdimensional overlords, but nothing prepared him for the pixelated beauty of Celeste's world. He was yanked into the game by some kind of invisible force; his HEV suit shimmered as it adjusted to this weird reality. The serenity with harsh surroundings did not go hand in hand with a sensation that urged him. Soon, the urge would find its reason-the mountain was on fire, its essence, the very code of the game unraveling.\r\n\r\nValue was a ghostly figure hanging over the mountain in a silhouette of greed and malevolence, feeding off of the destruction of art and effort, fire licking at every edge of Celeste's world. The brave climber of the mountain was ready to give up: \"I can't stop it alone,\" she said, shaking her voice looking up at the flames consuming the summit.\r\n\r\n\"You are not alone,\" Gordon said back, firm but quiet, as always. With his trusty crowbar and a new grappling hook-the mountain's gift-he joined Madeline upward. They climbed around flames and fought off Value's minions-twisted, corrupted versions of the mountain's obstacles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in BTD6, the Bloons became audacious: mysterious dark energies drove them to invade the heart of monkey civilization. Monkeys had become long divided into their specialty-Dart Monkey, Alchemists, and Super Monkeys-they found they needed each other to survive for the first time in their history. For the very first time, their rivalries are cast aside, and Quincy, the sharpshooter, stood atop the battlements, rallying his brethren.\r\n\r\n\"We do not fight as individuals, but as an army! For every pop, for every tower, we take back our land!\" And his words sent fire into their hearts.\r\n\r\nThere at the battlefield's heart was the Monkey Engineer, his huge portal machine tuned to harness the energies of dimensions. It opened into a shimmering rift, inadvertently bridging their world with that of Celeste's when it went off. The Bloons started seeping through, causing chaotic energy to potentially destabilize the fabric between both dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe higher Gordon and Madeline went, the weirder things started to get-odd, rubbery orbs floated about ominously: the Bloons. Confused at first, Gordon's HEV suit picked up that they were interdimensional anomalies in an instant. These invaders were impervious to the natural defenses of the mountain and began to sow chaos. Just then, a dart zipped through the air, popping the lead Bloon.\r\n\r\nFrom the portal emerged a squad of monkeys: Quincy, a Bomb Shooter, and an Alchemist. \u201cWe\u2019ve tracked the Bloons here,\u201d Quincy announced. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help.\u201d\r\n\r\nGordon nodded, the thoughts racing through his head. They formed an unlikely alliance with the monkeys and Madeline honed from the mountains. Put together, they created a plan whereby while Madeline and Gordon were to go upwards in their climb and confront Value, the monkeys were to secure the lower regions of the mountain by popping the Bloons and hence stabilizing the rift.\r\n\r\nThe climb became perilous as Value began to let loose its entire fury. Paths on the mountain twisted into impossible directions, and Gordon had to resort to his crowbar and grappling hook. Madeline was determined as she used her dash ability across fiery chasms, trying to find a way to help Gordon out. On their journey, they came across some remnants of the code of Celeste, pieces of the game's soul, which could serve in weakening Value.\r\n\r\nBelow, the monkeys went to war. Quincy's arrows rained with precision, while the Bomb Shooter decimated clusters of Bloons. The Alchemist supported them, buffing his allies with potions aglow with otherworldly energy. The waves of Bloons were overwhelming, but the unity of the monkeys did not break. \"Push forward!\" shouted Quincy. \"For the mountain! For our home!\r\n\r\nAt the summit, Gordon and Madeline were confronted by Value. The creature was a manifestation of avarice and corruption, its shape constantly shifting between waves of flame and fractured polyhedrons. \"You dare defy me?\" it thundered, shaking the very foundations of the game.\r\n\r\nGordon responded with action. He flung a shard of the mountain's code at Value, watched as it momentarily destabilized the entity. Madeline used her dash to distract Value, drawing its gaze from Gordon. Together, they struck a critical blow, embedding the remaining code fragments into Value's core.\r\n\r\nAs Value began to dissolve, it unleashed one final attack-a wave of fire and corrupted Bloons. The portal at the base of the mountain shook violently, threatening to collapse both dimensions. Gordon and Madeline prepared themselves, but in that moment, the monkeys showed up. Quincy shot a charged arrow through the storm, cutting a path for the Bomb Shooter to launch a final, fatal shot. The Alchemist locked down the portal, securing both dimensions in place.\r\n\r\nWith Value defeated, the flames that had consumed Celeste's world went out. The mountain was beautiful again; its code healed and strengthened. On the summit, Gordon, Madeline, and the monkeys stood shoulder to shoulder, staring out across a peaceful horizon.\r\n\r\n\"We did it,\" Madeline said, her voice full of gratitude.\r\n\r\nGordon said nothing; sometimes, silence spoke louder than words.\r\n\r\nQuincy offered an open hand. \"If you ever need any help, you know where to find us.\"\r\n\r\nThe alliance forged in chaos and fire left its mark on every world. Gordon returned to his dimension, changed forever by the experience. Madeline moved further along her journey, inspired onward by the strength she had witnessed. And the monkeys, victorious but humble, went back to their eternal fight against the Bloons, their spirits buoyed by knowing that even the unlikeliest of allies could join together and emerge triumphant over overwhelming odds.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it wasn't saving a game or a world; it was about the resilience of heroes, the power of unity, and the triumph of hope over destruction.\r\n\r\n",

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

1735887765}, "language": "english", "review": "Learn to Fly 3 is one of those games with its roots in the good old days of flash games, and although the game is simple, I think it is great nonetheless. \n\n(Here is a tip that I didn\u2019t want to put at the bottom of my review because I want people to see it, there are guides that provide codes you can put in to get bonus stuff. Use them you will thank me later.)\n\nOverall, the gameplay is straightforward, try to get your penguin to fly as far as possible by upgrading your penguin\u2019s ability to fly with wacky gear that you can pay for and upgrade after each run until you make it to space. Compared to the previous games in the series there is a lot more here and I think that it does add more to the fun. There is just something so addicting about doing run after run to not only complete the game but also get as many upgrades as possible to get even higher even when you have completed the main game. I was incentivized to put a lot of effort into trying to get many of the bonus upgrades because I wanted to 100% the achievements, and I really could have put fewer hours into the game to do so, but I went the overkill route and it seems to have worked out pretty well. I even got enough sardines that I was able to unlock all of the bonuses that you can purchase with sardines (the microtransaction currency you can pay for but I just earned them instead) by accumulating them over way too many runs, which is nice as it proves that you can get everything without spending a dime if you would like. Now this game is far from perfect it is extremely repetitive, collisions with objects are frustrating, and the balance is not great with several options being way better than many others, but it is a neat little time waster. I also don\u2019t think most people will get a ton of time out of this game unless you are achievement hunting though. My first run probably took me under an hour to get through and I expect that many people will be satisfied with doing that and then uninstalling the game. But that does not make the game bad, just simple and relaxing.\n\nThe story is barebones, but it doesn\u2019t need to be anything greater than what it is. Penguins are trying to get to space, so they are trying silly ways to do so. Simple as that. It is not great so nobody will play this game for the story, but it is cute and serviceable.\n\nThe sound design is quite weak. Music tracks are extremely limited and not really good at all in my opinion and as for the sound effects they are really basic. This is easily the weakest part of the whole game.\n\nI like the game from an artistic perspective. I think that the style is simple, cute, and fun; it really is reminiscent of the days of Flash animation, and I like that. However, the level of detail in the models is somewhat limited, and you have to choose between potato quality on a small window or upscaling at Fullscreen causes the game to hitch every now and then. Overall though, I like how it looks.\n\nAll in all, I think that Learn to Fly 3 is worth at least one run if you are a fan of the days of Flash games; it costs you nothing, it\u2019s cute, and it is
