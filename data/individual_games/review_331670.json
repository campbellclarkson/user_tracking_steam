Of all the Jackbox packs, my family comes back to this one consistently for Drawful, which is still our favorite drawing game in Jackbox's entire collection.\r\n\r\n* You Don't Know Jack 2015 - This is a pretty standard trivia game with a game show theme.  It's OK, but we prefer Trivia Murder Party if we're playing a trivia game usually so I don't really play this one much.\r\n\r\n* Word Spud - Players take turns typing words, continuing off of the words before them.  It doesn't really have much in the way of score keeping and overall isn't something we come back to.  Not one of Jackbox's best IMO.\r\n\r\n* Lie Swatter - A true or false trivia game.  The selling point of this game seems to be that it supports up to 100 players, but gameplay is very simplistic and for a smaller group, not one you're likely going to play often.\r\n\r\n* Fibbage - It's a trivia game with a twist - it's multiple choice but each player gets to provide one of the wrong answers.  You get points for picking the correct answer but you also get points if others pick your lie, so it becomes a game about coming up with plausible sounding lies to fool each other with.  This one is a lot of fun, and even with Fibbage 2, 3, and 4 in my collection we still come back to this one occasionally.  Each edition of the game has slightly different mechanics and different sets of questions so it's worth playing them all.\r\n\r\nDrawful - This is by far the best game in this pack.  Each player is given a prompt and must draw a picture representing that prompt.  Then, all players get to see the drawing and enter in what they think the prompt was.  Finally, everyone has to guess the correct prompt.  It combines the fool-each-other gameplay of Fibbage with the drawing elements of Pictionary and is one of Jackbox's best games.  Even with future editions of Drawful, we still find this one the best.  The silly sound effects, simple prompts, and simplicity of drawing make this an easy game for everyone to pick up and play.  This game accounts for the vast majority of our playtime in this pack, as we usually end up playing at least a few rounds of Drawful every time we sit down to play Jackbox games.", "timestamp_created": 1735196987, "timestamp_updated": 1735196987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "183705066": {"recommendationid": "183705066", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229291951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 975, "last_played": 1735181884}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game for family holidays!", "timestamp_created": 1735174380, "timestamp_updated": 1735174380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183694279": {"recommendationid": "183694279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284864836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 678, "last_played": 1735167121}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game to play, especially if you need to meet virtually.", "timestamp_created": 1735164785, "timestamp_updated": 1735164785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183688461": {"recommendationid": "183688461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118198091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1735168488}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun Family game.
