The game focused on 2 factions at war (Exiles and Dominion, each offering 4 distinct races), offered 6 different classes, each with unique animations and play-styles, and 4 different paths (Explorer, Scientist, Settler, Soldier), which would offer extra objectives while exploring the world.\n\nToo bad the endgame focused too much on attunement and 40-player content while most other MMOs started offering more smaller dungeons and raids, and didn't focus so much on the hardcore experience anymore. The performance wasn't great in large groups, so people would tend to do solo/smaller group stuff, so this most likely contributed to the game's downfall.\n \nAll in all, WildStar was a great MMO that died too soon.", "timestamp_created": 1736601946, "timestamp_updated": 1736601946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185269951": {"recommendationid": "185269951", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993805657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3880, "last_played": 1533576748}, "language": "german", "review": "Machs gut bestes MMORPG!", "timestamp_created": 1736526209, "timestamp_updated": 1736526209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185192421": {"recommendationid": "185192421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052125371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1526478084}, "language": "english", "review": "really enjoyed WildStar, Why won't NCsoft either bring it back or sell the rights to someone else.
