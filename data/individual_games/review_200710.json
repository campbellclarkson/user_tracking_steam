A nice little package with tons of content and inspirations from previous hack and slash games like Diablo. \r\n\r\nHowever, while the premise of this whole package is interesting, the contents are blander than a boxed pair of socks... And you don't even get to stay warm with them.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is rough. Very rough. While there are tons of skills and interesting ways to build, the game forces you to stay on those paths. You can only reroll your last 3 points worth of skills, and that's it. No experimentation other than having to replay the game all over again.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but even the interface and controls are clunky as all heck. For example, who in their right state of mind would make a channel ability target a monster, but also not locking the player in, so whenever you press the ability, the character just does milliseconds worth of damage and then just runs into the danger? You have to deliberately hold your ground with Shift, then press the channel skill button to have the skill behave how it's intended to be used.\r\n\r\nThe pet system is interesting, except when it just doesn't do anything worth talking about. The main usage of the pets are 1. Tanking for a few seconds, because the enemies will shred through them no matter what you do, 2. Buying a consumable just in case you forgot while in town, 3. Holding trash in inventory and selling it by making it unable to be used for a few minutes. Otherwise, the pet system is pretty pointless in the 20 hours I slogged through.\r\n\r\nLooting isn't that much more fun either. Fighting monsters felt sluggish and unrewarding. The environments are bland, and the presentation mediocre. I played a bit in Veteran, but never managed to reach more than level 20 out of boredom, in the multiple tries I gave to it.\r\n\r\nIf you're really desperate to play a Diablo-like, eh, give it a try if it's on heavy sale.

We played in 3-player co-op and I think I used fewer than ten health potions throughout the game, despite having hundreds. I did focus on having lots of armor, though, so maybe that's why. Friends died several times later in the game due to apparent one-shots, but I suffered no such difficulties. I may have died once, if at all.\n\nI played an engineer and found the abilities lacking. Granted, I only invested heavily in a few skills as I'm not very good at managing large numbers of abilities, but it was a little bit boring to be honest. I just kept an eye on my health orb, made sure my bubble was up to absorb damage, and popped a self heal in the event my health dropped at all. Rinse, repeat. Bosses failed to change things up.\n\nThe story is on the weak side and I only half paid attention to it: BBEG is trying to do something bad, so chase him down (i.e., navigate world areas and defeat the bosses left in his wake) and ultimately catch up and defeat him just before he can do the bad thing. The details seem kind of convoluted and random, but I get the feeling that story is largely secondary in games of this genre.\n\nMy biggest complaint is, I think, a problem of the genre: ability spam. It's all flashy effects (especially with more players) and lots of baddies on screen at one time and it becomes a bit of a mess that's hard to decipher. You don't really end up paying much attention to what's going on onscreen or who you're currently attacking, just choose a new target if the current one dies, occasionally trigger an offensive ability if you're feeling spicy, and watch your health. That seems to be the way other games (Diablo, et al.) play out as well and it's just doesn't seem that much fun to me, though I'm hardly an expert and maybe other genre staples are more interesting.\n\nIt's an okay game, just nothing remarkable. If you don't already own it from the many bundles it's been in, you can buy it for just a few dollars on sale. For that price, and with friends, it's worthy of a playthrough.
