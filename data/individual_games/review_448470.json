Gameplay practically boils down to placing single pixel cells and seeing how much cells already in the area are then effected and wiped to move on to the next levels. It will pretty much get very chaotic and difficult to control the cascading effects, so it is difficult for me to really call this a puzzle game.\n\nAchievements are rather annoying as it isn't all to clear what to do to obtain them and how frustrating gameplay can be.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nIf you find my reviews useful do follow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11028547-Dods-Echo-Chamber/]Curator[/url][/b] page for more!", "timestamp_created": 1736506254, "timestamp_updated": 1736506254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185209182": {"recommendationid": "185209182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256092555", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1736457110}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra fajnie wykonana, ale to wci\u0105\u017c tylko automat kom\u00f3rkowy\nPlus za spoko soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1736457145, "timestamp_updated": 1736457145, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183742829": {"recommendationid": "183742829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067684281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1735112355}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc5b4\uc57c\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub97c \ub290\ub07c\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9ce\uc774 \ube60\uc84c\ub2e4.\r\n\ud558\ub294 \ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uba74 \ub300\ucda9 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc\r\n'John Conway's Game of Life'\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uac00\uc838\uc654\ub2e4.\r\n\uac80\uc0c9\ud574\ubcf4\uba74 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc54c\uac8c \ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc548\ub2e4\uace0 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c4 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1735214001, "timestamp_updated": 1735214001, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 230, "total_negative": 169, "total_reviews": 399}, "cursors": {"AoJ497fh0eECequWmQE=": "Mon Jan 20 19:08:10 2025"}}
