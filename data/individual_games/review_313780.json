Lovecraft) is interesting. \r\nSometimes it feels a little wonky (there's a brick on the ground, have to move a little left to proceed forward).\r\n But atmosphere in general keeps you going.

Why do I not recommend this game then? Because quite frankly - I am not a fan of games that pretend to be adventure games but are in fact walking simulators. The game is too simple, too easy. There are maybe 2 actual puzzles in the game and even then they are very simplistic, the inventory screen might as well not exist and there wouldn't be much of a difference. So although I did have some fun with the game I cannot recommend it in good faith due to my own standards.\r\n\r\nHow's the story? It's mostly alright, I'm not the greatest fan of Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness as I feel it describes one of the less interesting parts of his world but if you enjoy that story yourself you will probably enjoy this too. The ending is underwhelming, [spoiler] it would have been better if we were left without knowing what the titular Conarium does, the fact that it merely turned the protagonist into one of the lizards feels like a very boring resolution for how much the Conarium has been built up during the story.[/spoiler] [spoiler]In the same way I feel like the Conarium was a really cool idea that would probably have done better if it was the center of its own cosmic horror story with its own ideas instead of relying on Lovecraftian mythos.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nA few times I got stuck on some furniture for no reason which was somewhat annoying but it wasn't a big deal.\r\n\r\nThere is a moment where the game introduces enemies, but they're more annoying than scary and thanfully they don't reappear later on.\r\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of the game is geniuently that it is just not an adventure game, it's mostly an exploration walking simulator which I'm not the biggest fan of. Yes you TECHNICALLY have some puzzles (if you consider copying a pattern from your in-game journal somewhere else a puzzle) but they're not really engaging.
