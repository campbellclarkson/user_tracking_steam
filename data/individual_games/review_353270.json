there is even a scene in which Nepgear uses her technological expertise to find an important item in one of the CPUs' homes, which allows the story to advance, but instead of thanking her, the CPUs pick on her because of how much of a nerd she is... it makes no sense.\n\n[h3]Plutia[/h3]\nYes, this one gets its own section.\n\nWhile there is division in the fan base about whether Plutia is a likable character or not, there is something more objective which is wrong with her presence in this game.\n\nThis being that she has the personality of an antagonist, while being treated as a protagonist for some reason.\nThroughout the game, she is entirely selfish, and on a number of occasions outright admits that she is only in it for herself - not only that, but she literally commits acts of sexual harassment against not only her enemies, but against her supposed \"allies\" as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the other party members (in spite of their opposition) do nothing to stop her, even when they outnumber her, and/or are stronger individually as well.\n\nSo you're trying to tell me about how evil the antagonists are, while the protagonists have a team member that does all this evil shit uninterrupted by any of them?!\n(This is another instance of the protagonists being out of character.)\n\nPlutia's personality and behavior is actually very similar to that of the main antagonist of this game, which makes her treatment as a protagonist absolutely nonsensical.\n\n(And there is no interesting moral conflict behind this either, Plutia literally just gets away with these things without much of a justification from any of the protagonists.)\n\n[h3]Plot holes[/h3]\nFinally, plot holes... mostly involving the antagonists.\n\nRe;Birth 3 features a variety of different antagonists - some old, some new.\n\nAs you would expect, you end up fighting those antagonists... but not only once... since for some reason the protagonists decide to constantly let them get away (either through some excuse, or even entirely off-screen, without any explanation).\n\nSome of these antagonists, you end up fighting 2 or 3 times, before you finally get to the end of the game... and after around chapter 6 (out of 10) I had to completely ignore the main story arch and focus on the banter between the main characters in order to retain any interest in continuing to play this thing, because of just how ridiculous things got...\n\nThey are your enemies - if you don't want to kill them (even though they want to kill you), then at the very least throw them in jail or something, but don't just let them go after defeating them!!\n(You know exactly what they're going to do afterwards!!)\n\n[h3]TL;DR[/h3]\nStory doesn't make much sense due to plot holes involving antagonists simply being let go without punishment in many cases (only to then attack again), as well as a number of protagonists being out-of-character for substantial periods of the game.\n\nIf you've made it this far in the Re;Birth series, you know that their gameplay mechanics are just copy/pastes of each other with very little change, so there's no need to even talk about those.\n", "timestamp_created": 1736717839, "timestamp_updated": 1736717839, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185203283": {"recommendationid": "185203283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097126228", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 2186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 490, "playtime_at_review": 2186, "last_played": 1736450998}, "language": "polish", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1736451005, "timestamp_updated": 1736451005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185167141": {"recommendationid": "185167141", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007117569", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2437, "playtime_at_review": 1915, "last_played": 1737209269}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u307e\u3060\u898b\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044ED\u306eCG\u304c\u89e3\u653e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u30cd\u30bf\u30d0\u30ec\u3092\u98df\u3089\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u4ee5\u5916\u306f\u7279\u306b\u4e0d\u6e80\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1736409484, "timestamp_updated": 1736409484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184963927": {"recommendationid": "184963927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451718159", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "playtime_at_review": 1806, "last_played": 1736301808}, "language": "english", "review": "Plutia", "timestamp_created": 1736197225, "timestamp_updated": 1736197225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184743751": {"recommendationid": "184743751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198885289835", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2865, "last_played": 1735758334}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce que j'appr\u00e9cie avec ce jeu c'est que c'est une claire \u00e9volution par rapport aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents opus.\nLes menus sont bien plus attirants et color\u00e9s, le syst\u00e8me de combat est repris des jeux originaux ce qui fait que l'utilisation d'items est bien plus \u00e9labor\u00e9e (pas autant que les jeux originaux).
