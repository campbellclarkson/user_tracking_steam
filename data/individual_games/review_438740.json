Each version of Jason from different films offers unique strengths, adding variety to gameplay.\r\nCounselor Dynamics: The counselors must work together to find items such as car keys, gas, and batteries to escape in vehicles or call for help. The thrill comes from the unpredictability of each match\u2014sometimes you find what you need quickly; other times, it feels like a desperate scavenger hunt.\r\nImmersive Horror Atmosphere\r\nThe game does an excellent job of recreating the eerie ambiance of Camp Crystal Lake. The graphics may not be cutting-edge by today's standards, but they effectively convey a sense of dread and tension. The sound design plays a crucial role in heightening the horror experience; the ominous music and Jason's iconic breathing create an unsettling atmosphere that keeps players on edge.\r\nInteractive Environment: Players can hide under beds or inside closets, which adds a layer of strategy to gameplay. The fear of being discovered by Jason while hiding is palpable and mirrors classic horror film tropes.\r\nCommunity and Multiplayer Fun\r\nOne of the standout features of Friday the 13th: The Game is its community aspect. Playing with friends or meeting new players online can lead to memorable moments filled with laughter and tension. The voice chat feature enhances communication among counselors, allowing for strategic planning or frantic calls for help when Jason is near.\r\nVariety in Matches: Each session feels different due to random item placements and player strategies. This variability keeps the game fresh and engaging, as no two matches are ever quite alike.\r\nChallenges and Limitations\r\nDespite its strengths, Friday the 13th: The Game has faced criticism over time. Some players have noted technical issues and bugs that can disrupt gameplay. Additionally, as the game has aged, balancing issues have emerged, particularly concerning Jason's overwhelming power compared to unarmed counselors.\r\nServer Shutdown: As of December 31, 2024, online services for the game have been discontinued due to licensing issues stemming from legal disputes since its release. This has limited access to multiplayer modes but still allows offline play.\r\nConclusion\r\nFriday the 13th: The Game offers a unique blend of horror and multiplayer gaming that resonates with fans of the franchise. Its engaging mechanics, combined with a strong emphasis on teamwork and strategy, create an unforgettable experience for players. While it may have its flaws, the thrill of surviving against Jason Voorhees is an exhilarating challenge that many will cherish long after their last match.

Instead of putting you in a corridor and jump scare you, this game provided this asymetrical arena gameplay where one person got to experience the joy of becoming Jason and the rest of players would have to run, hide, and repair their way out of the most iconic areas from the movies, and it did it perfectly, forget about DBD, never in my life i watched the Friday the 13th movies and thought to myself \"this is a universe that would play great as a video game\", i actually really struggle to feel like the previous movie in the franchise conects with the next one, cause they just don't, regardles the game's creators harbor such love and pasion for this franchise and found the almost perfect formula to make a game out of this horror fliks. \n\nFriday the 13th started as a game totally detached from the recognized franchise, called Camp blood the developers wanted to make a game that would homage the Friday movies tone, feel and atmosphere, and by a twist of fate they ended up getting the rights to the franchise and were able to turn this game from a homage to the movies into a real Friday the 13th videogame. It was rought around the edges, full of bugs, and jank, and even worst it was barely possible to find a match during the first days even weaks the game released cause they were not expecting as much people trying to log into their game... The game's popularity blew out of proportion, people wanted to play this game, more than the developers or xbox for example could have realised...\n\nBut then of course when something is too good to be true it just won't last forever....\nVictor Miller creator of the original Friday the 13th movie and producer Sean Cunningham entered a legal dispute over the rights for the character and franchise wich forced the videogame's development and further updates into a full stop indefinitely causing Gun Media and IllFonic to basically jump the boat and abandon the project to never look back on it and robing of us from the greatest horror game ever made in my opinion.\n\nNow this last paragraph is very personal, i wanted to play it every day till i got my fill, i even dusted off my old xbox machine cause online play on PC was hacked by people forcing players into infinite respawning lobbies and never ending matches where two Jasons kill people over and over again, basically ruining matchmaking for every player out there wishing to joing a public match. So i bought the game again, xbox pass too or whatever its called and jumped into the game this year to celebrate and send off this gem by giving it my proper respects and experience the trill of being hacked to death by a swesty Jason, getting ran over by a trolling Debora, or get left for death by a Chad getting away in a car you put togueter after getting grabed throught the window by Jason, it was gonna be glorious. \nSadly i have been felling very down this year, even tho i had all the time in the world to play it, i just could not force myself to get up early in the morning, but up the game and look for a match, every night i would go to bed thinking, i didn't feel in the mood today but tomorow i will pay the heck out of this game and have so much fun like i used to.....\n\nMonths went by, i did play some days more than others, but i never really stayed on for long, nor i could bring myself to play this game as much as i wanted to, its now January 1st, a couple hours ago i played some matches, i died every time, no bigie, as Jason i did pretty bad too, no problem, i always liked playing the worst Jasons to give councelors a chance anyway, game was always beter when everybody was having fun, i was called for dinner as a match started, i just sat there next to a foldable chair as a leopard Vikini wearing Chad hopping Jason would caught up and smash me againts it...\nCame back to check on the game to find that was my last match for the night, sever was down, this game is officially over...\n\nNot gonna lie i feel very sad, alot of people got to play this game till they where tired of it, while i was too tired to play most of the time, we were robed, there was plenty stuff coming our way before they stoped updating it, Jason x, space ship map, Kinky outfits for the whole councelor crew, there was even a snow Jason movie on the works that had to be laid down cause of the Lawsuit, i wish i could have played more, with all of you, rage quiters, sweaty tryhards, clueless casuals, Jason Killers and geometry bug exploiters all the same, it was a great game, i always was having fun no matter what, it was really great you had to be there, it was just so great, the funiest and more enteirtaining game i have ever played despite its flaws, Even staying as an observer just to watch Savini's Jason executions was a blast for me. It was a great time to be alive and play with you all, hope i could have force myself to engage more, but it is what it is, thanks to everyone who was a part of it. \n\nGo back to mama Jason, you were such a good boy.......\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735727166, "timestamp_updated": 1735727166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597411930561065674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184414271": {"recommendationid": "184414271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878020610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1716787835}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ojala haberlo jugado en su momento de gloria, juegazo de terror basado en una pel\u00edcula.\n RIP Friday the 13th", "timestamp_created": 1735725374, "timestamp_updated": 1735725374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184411503": {"recommendationid": "184411503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863228304", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1736054035}, "language": "english", "review": "RIP to the most fun and most frustrating game ever made.

While understandably many people hold the developers accountable - especially how they moved over to a similar [url=store.steampowered.com/app/1433140/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre/]game[/url] of another famous horror franchise; it is important to note, that shortly after the game was finally released (being in early access for quite a while), just a year later, from June 11, 2018 they were practically not allowed to 'touch' (including releasing new content and fixing bugs) their own game.\nWithout making accusations - everyone loves money, even though some people MORE so than others - this is mainly due to the doing of the copyright owner, for reasons unknown.\n\nA sad story it is indeed, since this game [strike]has[/strike] had everything (and more) the [url=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(franchise)]Friday the 13th movies[/url] had to offer. Yes, more, because let's be honest here: out of the 12 movies, 9 were utter garbage. Almost everyone knows the original, but while being good and atmosphere-heavy, it isn't really a true Friday the 13th movie: Jason Voorhees makes just a very short appearance and as we all know from the opening scene of the brilliant [url=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_(1996_film)]Scream[/url] - the killer is Jason's mother. There was a remake in 2009 based on the first couple of movies and it wasn't bad either. This leaves us with the [url=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_2]2nd part[/url], as the only truly appraisable Friday the 13th movie.\nThankfully, the developers knew this, so the game puts a heavy emphasis on building on the foundations of the 2nd part primarily.\n\nBut what [strike]is[/strike] was the game like? We get the basic concept of a multiplayer survival horror game (why do some people call it 'asymmetrical' - are they expecting just killers chasing each other?) in its purest, highly enjoyable form.\nThere are 7 (+1) counselors (students in their late teens/early 20s, expected to be watching over little kids coming to the camp for summer) who have to survive for 20 minutes while Jason is hunting for them. The map is fairly big and 20 minutes isn't that long, so it doesn't seem to be that hard... or does it?\nWell, since Jason cannot be killed, [spoiler]- not entirely true -[/spoiler] can teleport around, hear and occasionally see the counselors from afar and kill basically just by grabbing them, it's by no means an easy task, even if the counselors are able to fight back quite effectively (just like in the movies :)).\nThe game also offers single player content: lots of trivia can be unlocked and we can relive memorable scenes from the movies.\n\nWhile the maximum number of counselors in a match is 7, there are a total of 15 of them to choose from. They don't differ just in appearance, each have different statistics making them ideal for various approaches: either running, sneaking/hiding, repairing or fighting back. By equipping 4 perks/skills, we can further increase the effectiveness of the role we decide to play.\nOther than these, our best bet is staying together since we can help fellow counselors break free if caught, waiting inside a house (they are well-defendable, since Jason can't enter through windows) or we can call the police, shortening the time we have to endure (we still have to reach the exits where the police car is waiting though). Additionally there are 2 cars and sometimes a boat we can use to escape, but they both need to be repaired and fueled up (it's still not a life insurance, since Jason can easily stop both vehicles).\nQTEs - quick time events - (for repairs) work perfectly, without delay.\n\nJason always starts from the hut and his 4 perks (teleport, heat vision, shifting and stalking) can't be changed. We can however choose from his variations from the different movies along with his preferred weapons and accessories.\n\nsteamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396517623\n\nThe developers paid attention to small details and there are several seemingly obvious, but great ideas, such as looking for maps which we have to find first in order to avoid running around cluelessly or walkie-talkies that are required for in-game communications (we just hear the screams of nearby counselors otherwise). We also get spooked when being near to Jason, which affects our vision (not only it gets darker, but our HUD also disappears) and our character will become more likely to stumble.\nIf we get severely injured, our running speed decreases significantly, making our chances for survival almost 0.\n\nTommy Jarvis (a character who appears in 3 movies) can be summoned by making a call - just like in the case of the police - and with at least 1 counselor already dead (his control will be taken over by the dead player). He has superior stamina and arrives with a shotgun (just a single shot though). Again it's a fun way to draw back a player into the game (instead of just spectating or leaving) and Jarvis is actually useful for a unique move...\n\nObviously, given the circumstances, the game is littered with all kinds of bugs, some of them affecting gameplay quite seriously. The most annoying one is that Jason can be stunlocked by a well organized group: while practically hard to pull off - too many things have to match, having powerful weapons and no autistic teammates most importantly - it is possible and can result in all 7 counselors surviving. Counselors can also become invincible when hit during certain animations.\nSome of the glitches originate from the detailed (not just 1- or 2 layered) relief, certain actions (like the 100+ different, often environmental executions) can only be performed on flat terrain.\n\nThe game was amongst the first ones which used Unreal Engine 4 and it still looks great. There are no unnecessary visual effects besides the obligatory mild fog here and there (raining can be turned on optionally for maximum ambiance), just clean, pastel-like colours and along with the locations they provide a realistic look, successfully recreating the visual style of the (first) movies from the 80s. The 5 maps while all look similar (they are centered around Crystal Lake from the first 2 movies) don't get old and are large enough to provide entertainment on the long run.\n\nsteamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3393684392\n\nThe original background theme from the movies is still effective and so is the echoing voice of Pamela Voorhees, which are all present here. The surround sound is amazing, although the minimap (which actually shows Jason's location) lessens its usefulness. The television noise effect when Jason teleports around us is also a nice touch.\n\nDespite the semi-broken state it's in, [i]Friday the 13th: The Game[/i] is still tremendous fun. Now that the game disappears, after its short, 1-year-long glory, I can safely say, it's going to be missed.\n\nPROS\n+ very enjoyable gameplay\n+ lots of unique ideas\n+ large maps\n+ great sounds\n+ co-operation is rewarding...\n\nCONS\n- ...when done right, it can make the game very easy for counselors\n- lots of different bugs (no surprise)\n\nRATING\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1735670731, "timestamp_updated": 1735724764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680277764797210693", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184354628": {"recommendationid": "184354628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005848909", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 4178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4027, "last_played": 1735678800}, "language": "english", "review": "I met some of my closest friends through this game the opening weekend of launch!
