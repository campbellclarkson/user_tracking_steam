That\u2019s how I\u2019d describe Bioshock 2. This game\u2014and the series as a whole\u2014has been one of my greatest gaming discoveries in a long time. It\u2019s an underrated gem, especially when you compare its modest popularity to some of the more overhyped franchises out there.\n\nComing straight from Bioshock, I\u2019ll admit it took me a little while to adjust to the new gameplay mechanics. But once I got the hang of it, I was hooked. The story in Bioshock 2 somehow manages to be even better than the first, which is saying something. There are so many moments that stuck with me. The emotional connection between Delta and Eleanor, his Little Sister, adds so much depth to the world and makes the Bioshock universe feel even more alive.\n\nThe levels are super fun, and the battles with Big Sisters are unforgettable. The maps feel bigger and more complex than in the first game, and the addition of side quests\u2014like adopting and working with Little Sisters\u2014brings a fresh layer to the gameplay. Sure, the Vita Chambers make the game feel a little easier, but if you play on Hard and pretend they don\u2019t exist, you\u2019ll find yourself in for a real challenge.\n\nVisually, the game isn\u2019t going for realism, but it\u2019s beautiful in its own way. The colours, the lighting, the atmosphere\u2014everything about Rapture feels haunting and captivating.\n\nHonestly, Bioshock 2 is an incredible game, and anything I add feels obvious at this point. It\u2019s easily a 10/10 for me.\n\nPROS\nThe plot and characters are just amazing.\nThe bond between Little Sisters and Big Daddies still hits hard emotionally.\nBig Sisters are an awesome addition\u2014those fights are a blast!\nThe maps are bigger and more detailed than in the first game.\nYou can finally equip a weapon and a plasmid at the same time\u2014so satisfying.\nThey fixed two major issues from the first game: the loading times are super quick, and the subtitles are perfectly synced.\nTons of new plasmids and gene tonics, with upgrades that actually change how they work instead of just boosting damage.\nADAM is more plentiful now, which means you can really dive into experimenting with plasmids and gene tonics\u2014it\u2019s one of the most fun parts of the game.\nThe research system is way more challenging and rewarding this time around.\nAt one point, you even get to see the world through a Little Sister\u2019s eyes. Seeing Rapture as a fairy-tale castle while corpses appear as \u201cangels\u201d was such a unique and haunting moment.\nThe final stage and ending are absolutely phenomenal.\nYour moral choices influence Eleanor\u2019s personality and the ending you get. There are four possible endings, which makes it so much more replayable.\n\nCONS\nMovement is slower than the first game, but upgrades eventually fix that.\nThe controls feel a bit clunky at first, but they\u2019re fine once you adapt.\nThe maps are a little harder to understand initially, but you figure it out after some time.\nThe hacking system is different now. The minigame doesn\u2019t pause the action anymore, but you can hack from a distance, which is a nice trade-off.\nI really missed being able to revisit previous levels and find them just as I left them. Also, enemies\u2019 bodies tend to disappear more quickly in this game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBioshock 2 took everything I loved about the first game and added even more. The story is stronger, the gameplay is deeper, and the emotional moments hit harder. Whether it\u2019s the tense battles with Big Sisters or seeing Rapture through a Little Sister\u2019s innocent eyes, this game delivers an unforgettable experience.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t played it yet, do yourself a favour and dive in. You won\u2019t regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1735563778, "timestamp_updated": 1735563778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,
