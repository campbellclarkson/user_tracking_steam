America, so it simply doesn't phase me that because of my views you'll try cancel culture me and call me a four letter M word supporter.\n\nIt's just fun, it's everything a game should be, It's everything a game [i]used[/i] to be, It doesn't preach at you, it doesn't shame you, it doesn't tell you how you have think, it doesn't tell you what it believes is right and wrong, the only message here is \"I want to entertain you\".\n\nIt's just a fun game.\n\nIt won't please everyone, it's not meant too, it sure as heck won't please the [i]modern audience[/i] who it's not for and wouldn't play it anyways.\n\nThere's no modern gender hangups, there's no self hating protagonist, there's no forced political stances and views, there's just a fun story that aims at it's target demographic, does it well, and in no way does it need to apologise for it.\n\nThis game makes me smile, but it also makes me kinda sad seeing what we got from video games after this, and knowing this just simply wouldn't be tolerated by any publisher in 2025 because it's not inclusive enough, it says naughty words, It's not a predominantly female cast, the cast who are in it aren't described with an alphanumeric acronym, there's no focus on racial traits, it's only aimed at people who like Metal and Rock (Note: that's not just guys no matter how much people swear it is), and it doesn't try at all to placate people it shouldn't.\n\nWould love to see a sequel to this, though that won't happen, and I don't think it should given current climates, but I miss games like this, I miss having fun.",

Of course you need to be into this type of music (heavy metal). The references are great, as well as the voice acting - did they really get all these stars of heavy metal to voice in this game?!

The gameplay is refreshing and plenty: driving a car, doing solos, differents types of combos, controlling 'troops', and much more!\n\nThe only 2 downsides of this game: the graphics are pretty old now, and the game wants you to do things its way sometime.\n\nIt is worth its price, but if you can get it on sale I'd say it's a must-have if you are a metalhead!\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You
