I like the army management & camp system it's simple while still giving you options for your units. The units are quite balanced and have their own unique strengths/weaknesses and there are only a couple of weapons that are OP (snipers and certain artillery). My only complaint about the game, barring there not being MP support, is that the AI scales a lot even on normal difficulty. As such half-way through the campaign you might find yourself in an unwinnable position and from there the campaign is a death-spiral. However, going to easy difficulty gives you the opposite result and now you outnumber the AI 3-to-1.
