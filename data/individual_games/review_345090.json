I prefer \"turn based\" games where you get stages to upgrade towers.\n2) Tutorial: It's ok, but it doesn't describe all aspects of the game (upgrades, etc).\n------ I used YouTube videos to help with understanding the game a bit better.\n3) Plot: A bit thin (and this isn't a big negative)\n------ I bought this for the Tower Defense, not the plot, so this is a VERY MINOR negative.\n4) Quit (on button labels)\n------ This may be an English translation issue.  The word \"Quit\" is used in the place of \"Back\" at times.\n------ You may want to halt the game and restart.  You hit \"Quit\" (which is true) but you just go back to the prior screen (so you can start again).  I guess that it simplifies the game to use the same word in various places, I don't know.\n5) Screen/View: (out of visible area at times)\n------ There are several battles where the \"money\" towers are out of view.  You need to \"click the coins\" to get the money to upgrade your tower, BUT, the battle is on the top of the screen, where you need to click for \"gold coins\" (which you use for non-tower boosts (brick walls, mines, sat laser beam, etc).  There should be a way to size the whole map so it \"fits\" on your monitor, versus needless scrolling.  This is just more \"busy work\" like clicking coins.  It can be annoying.  Maybe this similar to Con #2 (mobile style game play).", "timestamp_created": 1735829246, "timestamp_updated": 1735830294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184474042": {"recommendationid": "184474042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052309645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1735770987}, "language": "english", "review": "A rather simple game that is clearly meant for cellphones", "timestamp_created": 1735771057, "timestamp_updated": 1735771057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184123011": {"recommendationid": "184123011", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967489780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1735413832}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to find a good cup of coffee for less than 2 dollars these days.
