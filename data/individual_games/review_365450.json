I sort of get what the devs were going for here, but all it does is encourage the player to pull  up a notepad on their second monitor, especially in the endgame when you need to juggle passwords and IP addresses for upwards of a dozen machines. Secondly, the node map. It's a cool concept but its insanely cluttered and unusable, to the point where the DLC gives you a way to sort it, so the devs know its a problem. but you just have to deal with it until you beat the dlc (intended to be played late in the main story)\r\n\r\nBeyond those flaws though, it's a very good little hacking game.

The story and music are great, and the exploration loop of finding IP addresses and looking through files is well put together.  Most of the challenges are very easy though.\r\n\r\nSome of the controls and mission triggers are really janky and broken.  For example, there is a mission where you get counter-hacked, and there are effectively 3 paths you can choose between, but the triggers for the non-main path are notoriously broken (there are endless results of people not unlocking it after meeting all the conditions if you search online).\r\n\r\nThe terminal also does not handle directory paths all that robustly.  For example, if you are in `/home` on a server and click `/log`, the game automatically issues the commands `cd ..` and `cd log`, but often these are done too quickly and the second command fails, so you don't always go to the directory you clicked on.  Similarly, if you have an exe in /home and want to move it to /bin, you can't do `mv foo.exe /bin/`, you have to do `mv foo.exe ../bin/`.\r\n\r\nBut most of the time the clunky edges of the controls don't really get in the way, and overall it is a fun game.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend Exapunks to anyone who is interested in this game or enjoyed it.

years old.\n\nI think when compared to games of around this era of the mid 2010s it's hard not to see it as a hidden gem that didn't really succumb to the wishes and whims of the public, which could be chalked up to Hacknet not being as popular as Goat simulator, meaning that the need for Matt to add redundant stuff that detracted from the original game and its initial vision is practically nonexistent anyway. But still, coming back to this after years and years of just forgetting that it exists is a real treat.\n\nI know it's a bit unfair to compare Hacknet to effectively a Unity engine sh%tpost but either way I'm glad that Matt Trobiani didn't just milk this game for all it's worth like the devs of Goat Simulator did. It sucks to see when games end up like that. Looking at you KSP 2... (and also FNAF holy sh%t that series got messy... scott you should've just ended it at three.)\n\nAs for Hacknet though i say it's worth every minute even if you can just blast through it in about six hours. The music, the vibes, the visuals, and even the additional challenges you can pose to yourself after going through the base game and/or labyrinths. (for example, breaking into the email servers and seeing what you can find, it is possible!)\n\nEither way, i do recommend Hacknet not just for newcomers to the game but also for people returning to it. Give it a few years and remember that it exists, a game fading into obscurity isn't really a bad thing, just means that you can just return to it after a while and enjoy it for the memories you've had with it on your first playthrough.

I guess that just goes to show the dev's talent with stressing you out.\r\nThe Labyrinths dlc is great, too. It's a whole extra storyline with a great sense of challenge and storytelling that I think improves on the base gameplay a lot.\r\nThe main storyline and the dlc took me only a little over 12 hours to beat, so it's not a huge dedication, but I will admit I needed some help from a walkthrough on a good few occasions. This game is teeming with secrets and easter eggs too, so I'd highly recommend replaying it to try and find those early on.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736032496, "timestamp_updated": 1736032496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184722426": {"recommendationid": "184722426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847230000", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1868, "last_played": 1735994349}, "language": "schinese", "review": "N/A", "timestamp_created": 1735982308, "timestamp_updated": 1735982358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184697089": {"recommendationid": "184697089", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082731236", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1759, "last_played": 1735955077}, "language": "english", "review": "!", "timestamp_created": 1735954936, "timestamp_updated": 1735954936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184690040": {"recommendationid": "184690040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154686692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1735955422}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving this game, I already knew a bit of command line but it actually made me feel more comfortable with it on top of it being a fun experience. \n\nSome really funny hidden gems in the game as well.

As someone who has basic knowledge into network/cybersecurity and has worked with UNIX terminals before it's immediately comfortable. I'm a bit of a slow learner but I found my rhythm relatively quickly. It does take a bit to get into the groove, I didn't find myself truly enjoying it until I was out of the tutorial and could choose my own missions and it felt more like a job than a learning obligation. Very interesting game design and it felt like more or less a perfect crossroads between simulating the complexity of the technology at hand (even though Naix was right- you're more or less just a script kiddie) and being a cool xD L33T H4XX0R game. \n\nSpoiler: [spoiler] My favorite mission was the pacemaker one. It gave you a background and a lead and basically said \"alright, figure it out\". It was a super surreal experience testing out a couple things to see if it would stop the heart and when my 3rd try actually worked I felt the real weight of a life on my hands. In contrast, the last lengthy mission with V to uncover Bit's past and everything was cool but it felt like I was getting handheld through the process and it was really annoying having to re-do some hacks (because I had missed some things and had to go back or wanted to double-check one of Bit's many servers) and suddenly encountering \"unhackable\" places. I didn't mind the slight shift to having to sleuth for passwords but it didn't come at the right time imo. [/spoiler]\n\nA couple issues- the node map quickly gets crowded around the end of the game (and isn't really meaningfully sorted), meaning it gets a little annoying to find what you need. When you get to around the last couple missions when you have to visit a lot of nodes it gets kinda cumbersome. This is compounded by the fact that you sometimes have to re-hack nodes if you want to revisit them in case you missed something. Double backing to \"double check\" a machine already isn't a super pleasant feeling, so if you're digging through a cluster of nodes to find it, just to have to re-execute what could be a pretty lengthy hack just gets kind of frustrating. If there were better organization of nodes or an option to dim the brightness/opacity of nodes I don't really care about at the moment, it would be great. In addition, the graphics are a little messed up. De-selecting fullscreen makes the display expand greater than my monitor size (even though the game resolution matches my monitor resolution).\n\nOtherwise- very fun game. Short length, about 5-8 hours to complete depending on your pace and experience on a terminal. Had a nice time spending my NYE on this one.
