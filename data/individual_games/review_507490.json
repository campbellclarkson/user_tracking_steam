I second those talking about fighting the UI and automation rather than the opponent. For me, the first example are the icons which are wildly inconsistent and impossible to decipher. No NATO or Supcom rectangles; they're almost all vague silhouettes or weird piles of crates with gunbarrels. \n\nFormations and Armies are a brave idea, but horrendously poorly executed and not integrated with control groups at all, plus it's hard to tell the count of what you actually have selected because there's very little communication with the user other than selection outlines. It's visually beautiful but the tutorials did not end up very much like the screenshots. Rather, automatic banners for my armies ended up out of place or missing units inside the army.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I tried it, but the UX was pretty bad and apart from novelty, it's hard to justify keeping it rather than just playing another match of Supreme Commander (whose mechanics and interface honestly still hold up well).

'Capture the flag' appears to be the only type of gameplay, a bit better than average 'capture the flag' thanks to some interesting combat options, but barely.\n\nIssues:\n- Combat relies more on your reaction time than your strategy, numbers are more often than not the winning strategy, path to victory is narrow. Strategies like drawing your enemy away from defensive lines than flanking ranged units are generally not possible, same with ambushing. Map forces you to go head on.\n- 'Research' is linear and boring (you just increse damage, HP, radar range, storage capacity)\n- Lacking UI. Example: Defences show their range when you place them, but not when you select them, not even if you hover over a specific weapon in UI.\n- Controls are somewhat lacking and counter intuitive. Example: canceled build queue for engineers by accident too many times.\n- Engagement range and map feel rather tight for the number of units involved (most units fight practically point blank).\n- Environment practically doesn't exist. I didn't notice any effects from terrain besides on pathing, there is no benefits from keeping your units on high ground or on some specific type of terrain. Terrain Pathability is binary - either all land units can use this path at full speed or none can use it.\n\nIn 2 hours I finished around 7 campaing missions (over half from the selected compain) and each one was boring, may be the game blooms later or DLCs change it for the better, but I lost the motivation to continue.", "timestamp_created": 1735776345, "timestamp_updated": 1735781152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513752460479736328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184406331": {"recommendationid": "184406331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040359453", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1735977843}, "language": "english", "review": "After many years, finally worked on Steam/Linux.
