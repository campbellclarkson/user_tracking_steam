There is absolutely zero automation and you will have to check back regularly to collect materials and kick off long timers for making food, going on raids, starting battles etc. Absent the timegates, it's not idle at all!\n\nThere are also not enough new mechanics to keep things interesting. You'll be doing much the same thing over and over again for hundreds of hours. Even with 100x speed and hacking hundreds of thousands of the premium currencies in, I still had to resort to idling an autohotkey script I wrote or risk getting repetitive strain injury from the tedious upgrade loops.\n\nI played up until the last achievement, but I was in full sunk cost fallacy mode.
