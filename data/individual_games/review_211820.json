I like the exploring, mining and building.  But the game doesn't really explain how you do anything and imo has some severe techincal limitations.  For example, I started a dedicated server with a friend who ended up in a completely different solar system from where i started.  I could still beam to them which worked but then I couldn't get back to the house we built with all of our stuff unless they were logged on or I built a flag to bookmark it.\r\n\r\nSo I built the flag.  Cool, problem solved.  Then I moved the flag to the upstairs of the house.  Figured i'd have to recreate the bookmark, which I did.  Got killed by a monster (you die A LOT in this game mostly due to being forced onto a keyboard or play with TERRIBLE controller support).  Back on the ship, I noticed there were now two bookmarks for the house.  I deleted one and teleported to the remaining one. I respawned on the ship and now both bookmarks are gone.  No way to get to the house unless my friend is on.  No feul to fly to their system.  Not good enough gear yet to get fuel.  So, I have to start from scratch or wait for them to logon.  1/10.

I vari mondi, proceduralmente generati, sono quasi identici. Posso cambiare vagamente i colori, alcune decorazioni, ma finisce l\u00e0. Una volta conosciuta quella tipologia di mondo, si perde subito l'elemento di novit\u00e0. I nemici, anche se dall'aspetto diversi, sono tutti identici nelle dinamiche. Stessa IA, stessi attacchi e stessi pattern, facili da individuare, ma difficili da gestire per via dei comandi di gioco (altamente legnosi). \n\nIl gioco ha una storia principale e delle side quest che si possono svolgere, tuttavia \u00e8 facile stancarsi. La storia principale sembra scritta da un bambino di 10 anni, mentre le side quest sono un eterno ripetersi di \"oh ciao, mi porti quello?\", \"mi uccidi quell'altro?\" In un ripetersi procedurale di cose IDENTICHE da fare, sia per quanto riguarda gli npc \"random\", che gli npc \"principali\". Si tratta sempre di esplorare gli stessi posti, per trovare le stesse cose, in modo sempre noioso. \nA proposito di npc: noiosi, ripetitivi, senza niente di interessare da raccontare. Alcuni sembrano le caricature di personaggi di altri giochi, altri sembrano l'ombra di chi avrebbero voluto essere da grandi. \n\nL'esplorazione \u00e8 monotona, perch\u00e9 si ritrovano ancora e ancora gli stessi elementi. Scavare \u00e8 tedioso, i drop non valgono mai il tempo speso, le chest sono piene di schifezze che il giocatore smette di usare dopo i primi 60 minuti di gioco, perch\u00e9 esistono alternative migliori. Morire \u00e8 facile, e punitivo. Costruire una colonia, richiede uno sforzo immane per accumulare le stronzate che servono a creare degli edifici, e le risorse sono ben lontane dall'essere le une vicine alle altre. \n\nLa grafica \u00e8 carina, e lo stile \u00e8 sicuramente interessante. La colonna sonora \u00e8 la parte migliore di tutto il gioco. Il concept \u00e8 accattivante, e per le prime ore di gioco sembra che parte della frustrazione derivi dall'inesperienza del giocatore, ma poi ci si accorge che \u00e8 impossibile adattarsi a certe meccaniche, o divertirsi ripetendo quelle che diventano le stesse quest. \n\nCi sono una serie di razze che si possono scegliere all'inizio del gioco, ma a parte l'aspetto estetico non fa alcuna differenza se decidi di giocare una scimmia di merda, un umano, o un uccello. Zero perk, zero fantasia. \n\nLa gestione dell'inventario e l'hotbar per la selezione degli oggetti sono le cose pi\u00f9 merdose che ho visto in 30 anni di carriera di gaming; dei veri aborti. \n\nPotrei continuare, ma mi fermo qui.\n\nLe 103 ore di delusione accumulate su questo gioco sono dovute ai miei vari tentativi di farmelo piacere/ricominciarlo a pi\u00f9 riprese, ma non ho mai finito un playthrough.\nE se mi chiedete perch\u00e9 sono arrivato a 103 ore di gioco la risposta \u00e8 questa: [b]\"avete presente quando uscite e avete voglia di sushi, pizza, cocktail, ecc? Vi sedete: il piatto \u00e8 una merda, il drink \u00e8 una cagata, ma lo mangiate/bevete tutto lo stesso. Perch\u00e9? avevate quella voglia specifica, non volevate fare problemi, avevate fame, avevate sete...ma sempre di merda siete stati.\"[/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1736946202, "timestamp_updated":

I like the game, personally I enjoy the building and exploration and the story was fun the first time through if a little repetitive. The modding community is also unreal for this game they create brilliant mods that make Starbound feel like a whole new game. I enjoy using it for creative products and its a very chilled out, go to game for me even if it has so many issues.\n\nThis game has so many performance issues that not even modding can fix- every month I discover a new very commonly acknowledged bug that just remains unfixed by the devs. It is common knowledge this game was released unfinished and \n with community-made unpaid content included. The devs were really shitty about the whole thing and do not deserve support. If you don't know please look it up for details on this.\n\nMany bugs straight-up corrupt files and the only way to stop this is to regularly, manually back up and replace said corrupted files from backups otherwise there's a high chance you loose your entire Universe. The game is also just built poorly- it runs laggy as hell even when PC specs are well above recommendation and crashes often loading time also takes ages. There are Mods that can help performance but not fix it entirely.\n\nIf this game worked and all the features promised were out and it was properly balanced I'd recommend it but that's unlikely to happen so I won't. For a new player, it's not worth picking up and there are better options that are far less frustrating.\n\nI do recognise the irony of this review with my hours, all I can say is leave me and my comfort pile of shit alone.

At first, the game\u2019s charming pixel art and vast procedural galaxy completely captivated me. I loved hopping from planet to planet, never knowing what kind of environment, creatures, or treasures I might encounter. The exploration was addictive, and the ability to shape and build my own bases gave me a real sense of ownership over my journey. The sci-fi aesthetic mixed with whimsical humor made the game feel unique, and the range of biomes and planets kept me curious about what else I might discover.\n\nThat said, after a while, the gameplay loop started to feel a bit repetitive. The procedural generation, while impressive, sometimes resulted in planets that felt more generic than distinct, and the quests often boiled down to fetch missions that lacked depth. The combat was serviceable, but it didn\u2019t feel particularly tight or rewarding, and it sometimes got in the way of the exploration I enjoyed so much. Multiplayer was fun with friends, but the lack of a strong endgame or meaningful progression left me feeling like my adventures eventually ran out of purpose.\n\nStill, Starbound was a relaxing and creative experience that scratched my itch for exploration and building. It may not have the staying power of some other sandbox games, but its charm, freedom, and sheer scope make it a game I\u2019d revisit whenever I just want to wander the stars and see what\u2019s out there.\n\nPersonally I felt like the game was a great successor to terraria, dare i say even better.

But for people who dislike endless aimless wandering and prefer to have stated goals, the game provides some to you.)\n\n+ Music is great, appealing but still ambient enough to not get tiresome after many dozens of hours on repeat.\n\n+ Graphics likewise strike a nice balance between being smooth and simple without being too pixelated to tell what things are.\n\n+ A vast wealth of crafting options and upgrades, as you'd expect in a survival crafting game, and also some rarer upgrades for your movement abilities and your multipurpose mining tool \"Matter Manipulator\" which do everything from increasing range/speed/area to letting you mine water and recolor things.\n\n+ Matter manipulator is unloseable and unbreakable, so even on drop-everything-on-death mode, you never have to worry about trapping yourself in a position where you can't grab whatever materials you need.\n\n+ Wide variety of planets to explore with their own biomes and weird freaky creatures, trees, and NPCs. \n\n+ You get a giant mech that you can upgrade\n\n\n= Multiplayer is finally functional on Steam so you can just invite friends without being a tech wizard\n\n\n- Combat is \"fine I guess\", not great but not terrible\n\n- Story campaign is not super-compelling, and there's more fun to be had in exploring random anomalies and the like than in trying to scan a dozen artifacts from whatever the next civilization is.\n\n\nAll in all, a compelling game that's easy to get lost in and lose track of time.

Let me explain the pros and cons respectively and I'll get depth on why I feel the way I do.\n\nPros:\n-Large variety of blocks, resources, crafting and building\n-Inter-planetary travel\n-Worlds loop around\n-Worlds have their own major and sub biomes\n-Rich lore and many playable races\n-Advanced modding community\n-Wide roster of weapons\n-Selectable difficulty levels\n-Customize your own space ship and pilot your mech\n-Build a crew or develop a colony\n-Lots of exploration to do\n-Lovely soundtrack\n-Cozy pixel art style\n-Enemies won't track you unless you go close\n-You can duel wield\n-Encounter structures and villages\n-Special abilities to augment your movement\n-Ways for farming and automation \n-More content than you know what to do with\n\nCons:\n-Overwhelmingly reliant on mods\n-Clunky Combat\n-World weather and enemies can grief\n-Extremely limited viable usage of mechs\n-Crafting vs exploring progression at odds\n-Planets become redundant\n-No variation of underground structures or layouts\n-NPC's that aren't merchants painfully bland and useless\n-Crew members are brainless bullet sponges who stand in everyone's way. Even yours.\n-Trying to read the lore is punishing to the player, the game does not pause when reading and hunger ticks down\n-The story and progression is messy, and mods have no real answer\n-Difficulty seesaws between too hard and too easy, and NPC quests do not scale to the the planet's threat level\n-90% of loot is weapons. You'll have too many weapons and none strong enough for what you actually need to face\n-You have to dedicate the game's accessory slot to an item called \"EPP\" in order to survive a planet for more than a minute.\n-Boss loot is often underwhelming, and enemy loot is 90% low-tier crafting resources\n-No minimap to track where you are or where you've been\n-Sub menus like inventory and codex do not pause the game even if you play singleplayer\n-No real to stifle enemy spawns for safe building, or increase them for combat\n-Quest markers are often inaccurate and unreliable\n\n\nI loved this game at first, got addicted even. While this game does have a lot of content, it doesn't have depth. Colony building, trading, events, missions, but they all feel very surface level. While it's easy to get caught up in the glitz and glamour of a new race mod, new weapon set, or a new planet, but that can only go so far. I kept getting sobered by the fact that these planets have nothing new but recolored rock and soil, I need a new EPP to survive on the planet, and encountering a village of the new race mod I installed only gives me 1 line quotes and the same awful quests I can get anywhere. I thought I try my hand in colony building, only to realize they don't have any of the charm or utility of minecraft's villagers or terraria's town NPC's. The one time you find a mission, structure or enemy encounter that's exactly to the level of your gear and weaponry, the fun ends the moment you realize enemies don't respawn/have a spawner to come back from and the moment is all gone once you deal with all the enemies.

ml\nEgg \u2013 1\nSalt \u2013 1 tsp\nFor the filling:\nPotatoes \u2013 1 kg\nOnions \u2013 2\nLard or butter \u2013 50 g\nSalt \u2013 to taste\nGround black pepper \u2013 to taste\nPreparation steps:\nMaking the dough:\nSifting the flour: Sift the flour into a large bowl.\nMaking the dough: Add salt and the egg to the flour. Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Saut\u00e9 the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the saut\u00e9ed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or saut\u00e9ed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!", "timestamp_created": 1735127589, "timestamp_updated": 1735127589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183629785": {"recommendationid": "183629785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390406463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1859, "last_played": 1735614299}, "language": "english", "review": "If you dont own terraria, leave this storepage and go buy terraria instead.\nThere's a lot of hate for Starbound because of the devs which is totally valid, the devs are absolutely trash and dont deserve to own the title of the creators of this game, the game could've been so much more than it is, but it's still great as it is.

O jogo tem muitas coisas divertidas como um universo infinito que voc\u00ea pode explorar, o problema desse aspecto entra quando voc\u00ea j\u00e1 explorou cada tipo de estrela algumas vezes, j\u00e1 que come\u00e7a a ficar meio repetitivo j\u00e1 que cada esp\u00e9cie possui umas 2 estruturas cujo voc\u00ea pode encontrar (o que somaria aproximadamente em umas 8 ou 10 estruturas diferentes encontr\u00e1veis), ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a encontrar muita repeti\u00e7\u00e3o pelos planetas, j\u00e1 que al\u00e9m das estruturas criadas por gente existem as estruturas do planeta cujo podem fazer ele se repetir mais ainda.\n No quesito de combate, o jogo n\u00e3o peca muito contra inimigos comuns j\u00e1 que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o deveria ter tanto trabalho quando o assunto \u00e9 lidar com poucos inimigos, a dificuldade nesse aspecto s\u00f3 vem quando o jogo lan\u00e7a muitos inimigos de uma vez, mas ainda assim nada demais. Contra bosses eu sinceramente sinto que eles s\u00e3o meio 'simplera' demais, (vou comparar o jogo a Terraria um pouco agora) jogando Terraria pela primeira vez sempre que eu enfrentava um boss novo parecia um experi\u00eancia diferente e divertida, contra os bosses de Starbound eu entrava no boss, tomava alguns hits e depois j\u00e1 entendia o moveset o suficiente pra n\u00e3o morrer uma singular vez na luta, j\u00e1 que cada boss tinha poucas diferen\u00e7as de ataques, al\u00e9m dos ataques serem muito simples. Por exemplo, um boss cujo curti muito e fiquei meio triste que n\u00e3o houveram mais bosses com mec\u00e2nicas interessantes igual a ele foi o primeiro boss do jogo, uma criatura que fica no centro da arena e voc\u00ea tem que ativar consoles pr\u00f3ximos para causar dano, que por mais que seja uma mec\u00e2nica simples, realmente diferencia ele do resto dos bosses, j\u00e1 que a maioria deles se resume a esperar o boss aquietar pra voc\u00ea conseguir bater nele sem ser brutalmente morto (alias alguns deles nem \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio voc\u00ea tomar cuidado para n\u00e3o morrer j\u00e1 que ele mal consegue fazer nada contra voc\u00ea). Alguns bosses parecem terem sido feitos f\u00e1ceis demais e outros quase tiveram uma dificuldade boa mas adicionaram algum fator desnecess\u00e1rio (como o drag\u00e3o de ossos cujo N\u00c3O precisava invocar cultistas para te bater junto dele, j\u00e1 que o fogo no ch\u00e3o j\u00e1 atrapalhava o suficiente a lutar contra ele).\n Os itens eu tamb\u00e9m senti uma tristeza na hora de consegui-los, j\u00e1 que minerar nesse jogo \u00e9 uma tristeza, pois voc\u00ea precisa descender bastante nos planetas para conseguir bastante min\u00e9rio, mas se voc\u00ea descer muito voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode teletransportar e \u00e9 obrigado a voltar a p\u00e9 (cujo pode lev\u00e1-lo a morte e consequentemente a perder os min\u00e9rios coletados caso voc\u00ea esteja na segunda dificuldade como eu). Al\u00e9m disso quando o assunto eram armas eu percebi bastante que as armas que voc\u00ea constr\u00f3i n\u00e3o s\u00e3o nem perto de forte quando comparado as armas encontradas em miss\u00f5es, bosses e coisas semelhantes (eu mesmo desisti muito r\u00e1pido de craftar armas e passei a usar armas que me foram dadas pelo resto do jogo.\n Os planetas no geral n\u00e3o apresentam tanta dificuldade, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o de um cujo eu tive especial dificuldade em fazer qualquer coisa, esse sendo os planetas vulc\u00e2nicos, j\u00e1 que a chuva de fogo atrapalha a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, a lava te mata rapidamente se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tomar cuidado e por fim, os meteoros. Os meteoros quebram blocos e te d\u00e3o hit kill (pelo menos pra mim eu sempre levei hit kill).\n Por fim em considera\u00e7\u00f5es finais, o sistema de fome \u00e9 algo desnecess\u00e1rio que s\u00f3 serve como uma inconveni\u00eancia leve que pode se tornar um problema caso voc\u00ea se esque\u00e7a dela e n\u00e3o colete muita comida pelo jogo.\n No geral o jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 RUIM, mas poderia certamente muito melhor com alguns update para deixar mais interessante, portanto vou tentar uma jogatina com mods e possivelmente editarei essa analise com uma sess\u00e3o extra falando sobre
