E o jogo faz um excelente trabalho em explorar as complexidades da moralidade at\u00e9 onde vale suas a\u00e7\u00f5es para a cumprir nosso objetivo de vingan\u00e7a, tanto que no come\u00e7o, ela repete bastante que n\u00e3o se importar com nada e s\u00f3 busca vingan\u00e7a,.\n\nAl\u00e9m disso, um dos pontos mais profundos da narrativa \u00e9 como ela lida com os seus pr\u00f3prios sentimentos, e como o pesar e a raiva moldam sua personalidade e suas decis\u00f5es. Ela \u00e9 uma protagonista que diferente de muitos outros her\u00f3is que buscam um prop\u00f3sito altru\u00edsta, ela carrega um peso psicol\u00f3gico e emocional muito grande, o que a torna uma figura extremamente humana e com a qual \u00e9 f\u00e1cil se identificar, eu, particulamente, muitas partes, senti o peso junto.\n\nCara, de verdade, tem momentos que  voc\u00ea t\u00e1 ali acompanhando os di\u00e1logos e simplesmente parece que voc\u00ea t\u00e1 l\u00e1, tem momentos que tive vontade de abra\u00e7ar ela, a Velvet kkkk.\n\nA rela\u00e7\u00e3o dela com os outros membros do grupo tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 central para o desenvolvimento da hist\u00f3ria. Cada um deles tem seus pr\u00f3prios traumas e motiva\u00e7\u00f5es, o que cria uma din\u00e2mica interessante e, em certos momentos, dolorosa. A complexidade das intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os personagens adiciona mais camadas \u00e0 narrativa, revelando que o caminho de Velvet n\u00e3o \u00e9 um que ela trilha sozinha, mesmo que, em muitos momentos, pare\u00e7a ser.\n\nEm termos de jogabilidade,  as batalhas s\u00e3o din\u00e2micas e fluidas, e muitas vezes n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 ficar batendo, dependendo do inimigo, \u00e9 bom planejar uma estrat\u00e9gia para conseguir vencer, um exemplo mesmo, s\u00e3o os chefes de \u00e1reas, muitos voc\u00ea n\u00e3o consegue vencer s\u00f3 indo batendo, eles lan\u00e7am debufs que fazer voc\u00ea ficar lento, paralisado, ent\u00e3o tem que ter estrat\u00e9gia nas lutas, mas o que realmente se destaca \u00e9 o uso da hist\u00f3ria e das escolhas para impactar o ritmo das lutas. A maneira como as batalhas refletem a intensidade emocional da protagonista adiciona uma camada de imers\u00e3o ao jogo, ela gritando de raiva em certas nessas, principalmente quando enfrentamos o nosso mestre, o Artorius.  Mas tem um ponto bacana aqui, quando voc\u00ea descobre as motiva\u00e7\u00f5es do Artorius, quando voc\u00ea ver as coisas pelo ponto de vista dele, voc\u00ea percebe que tanto ele, quanto a Velvet, acabaram caindo em um caminho similiar,  um caminho de \u00f3dio e tristeza por perderem que amavam, e isso \u00e9 o que mais tocou.\n\nNa luta final contra o Artorius, a cena em que o Artorius fala que no dia que ele perdeu seu filho e sua esposa, ele diz, que sempre se perguntou se as coisas fossem diferentes se quem tivesse morrido fosse a  Velvet e seu irm\u00e3o, e em contraponto, Velvet responde que ela queria ter morrido naquele dia. \n\nOutro ponto impactante, \u00e9 que quando Velvet derrota o Artorius, ela atravessa a espada nele, no mesmo momento, antes de come\u00e7ar o dialogo que falei, ela come\u00e7a a chorar, pois no fim de tudo, Artorius tamb\u00e9m era membro da sua fam\u00edlia, ele \u00e9 o marido de sua falecida irm\u00e3, e foi ele que cuidou dela e ensinou ela a lutar, e quando voc\u00ea ver as coisas pela vis\u00e3o de ambos, voc\u00ea at\u00e9 se lamenta pelo rumo da hist\u00f3ria.\n\nNo final das contas, Tales of Berseria \u00e9 uma obra que aborda temas de vingan\u00e7a, arrependimento, sacrif\u00edcio e, acima de tudo, a complexidade das emo\u00e7\u00f5es humanas. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 respostas f\u00e1ceis ou solu\u00e7\u00f5es claras, e isso faz com que a hist\u00f3ria seja memor\u00e1vel e, talvez, uma das mais sombrias e impactantes dos jogos que joguei.\n\nO final \u00e9 me pegou, simplesmente, me pegou, n\u00e3o achei que no fim do jogo, Velvet iria se sacrificar, enfim...\n\n\u00c9 um jogo simplesmente maravilhoso que fez eu me apaixonar. \n\nRecomendo, ou seja..

At least in Tales of Arise, they didn't try to be subtle about the world building at the start. They just told you how it was and built the world from there. A lot of the plot points of what's about to happen are blatantly obvious even though they're trying to hide it in the world building. Typical slice of life anime tropes that are bland. The acting feels half-hearted at best.\n\nI'm just going to give spoilers here with no spoiler tag. Mainly because its so early ingame and to show how bad the writing is:\nLuphicet said something along the lines of (not direct quote): \"This is a compass. Its made to be level regardless of how bad the waves at sea are. Its perfect for an adventure!\" Just... really? I know I'm playing and RPG/adventure game. There is no reason to bring this up. Its incredibly cringe.\nI got to the point where Luphicet needed to be found because he wandered off without permission. I already knew that he was going to get into trouble (or Velvet get into trouble on her way to him or on their way home). The day before her weapon master/father figure/teacher said to be careful there were daemons around. I didn't even get to find him. I already knew what was going to happen that would set off your need to go on an adventure. I stopped playing shortly after this point. It was just too bland.\n\nFps is locked to 60fps with jittering in the framerate. Get special K mod to smooth this out. Controls feel even more clunky than in Zesteria. They tried to smooth it out from Zesteria, but made it feel even weirder with KB/M. In Zesteria it the turns were sharper and more responsive.

On the Scarlet Night, Velvet's life would fall apart, becoming a Therion and being held captive on a prison island. Her hatred for a man who was once part of her family for sacrificing her brother was her drive. However, as the story goes along. You see she faces hardships, endures terrible truths.\n\nThough most of all, you see as she grows and tackles her challenges. Her tale is a tragic one, and this steadily builds as she takes on the hatred of the world as the Lord of Calamity. You see how she lost everything, but eventually finds a place among pirates and others.\n\nAnd despite her path, she is shown to have a soft side. The characters, all of them blend very well together, their differences is what unites them against a common goal. And the twist being that the savior was the oppressor, and the one the people most loathe was actually their savior.\n\nThis game really hammers in the grey line of morality, as well as how the common feelings of selfishness is just what makes people human. There will come hard times, some more difficult than the last, but it is not something to shy away from.\n\nTo cut it short, it does well to leave a lasting impression with valuable lessons.\n\n\"Why do birds fly?\"\n\nA very basic question, with great complexity. And Velvet's answer is one that will hit deep.\n\nSystem:\n\nThe battle system is more complex the deeper you get into it, but pretty easy to get into. What is needed to be known is that you can use 16 artes + 4 extra. You have SG which acts as the cost, and BG which is the cost for Mystic Artes. \n\nLearning the system is key to making battles easier in the harder difficulties. An example? Velvet does more damage the lower her life is when she is in her Therion state. If she can stun the enemy, which makes them vulnerable. On top of being at low HP, her damage shoots through the roof.\n\nLittle things like these, which can be made easier with weakness exploits.\n\nMaps:\n\nQuite a lot, and pretty large, with its details being really good.\n\nMusic:\n\nAmazing. This game knows how to use it to tell a magnificent story. Some of the most heart wrenching, but also exciting ones when need be. Plus, the placement of it lands very well. The music reflects the theme of the game very well.\n\nArt Style:\n\nVery good, and even better with the animation scenes.\n\nOverall:\n\nTales of Berseria is basically the height of the series. The bar was set insanely high on this one. It is a tale of not only vengeance, but more importantly. Loss, despair, happiness in the face of sadness. What one is willing to do to achieve their desires. Though, more importantly. A tale that makes the world feel alive, and through the characters that grow close like family. \n\nYou see as they share good and bad times, how they live their life and push forward from their beliefs. A story where what the surface shows isn't what it appears to be. There is a lot to take in with this game, more than I can explain.

The story wasn't the deepest or best, but it was enjoyable enough to want to finish the game and see how it all ended. I also enjoyed the abundant number of the little character cutscene things that would pop up when you were running around, and my game stats said I had seen around 320 of them. It made the characters a bit more enjoyable. All of the main cast are given little side arcs to see a bit more of their backstory, and I enjoyed the depth it gave. I think the character development between most of the characters was done pretty well. Rokurou and Eizen were my favorites. Also, it was a nice change with the main characters being more evil than just the typical good guys.\n\nCombat was fun, I enjoyed it, and the level up system wasn't too grindy, though I had hoped it could have been a bit harder, as I played on hard mode and beat the main boss at like level 56, when the main boss was like 65. I enjoyed taking all of the different moves and trying to find ones that connected well with each other to maximize damage and status effects. Even if you had to grind, it was very easy, just get a darkness potion and gather a group of enemies in a field.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is how much it makes you run around without any warp points or anything. It gives you items for warping, although much later in the game, and they often turn out to be useless because there's a cutscene in an area you need to walk to. I get the cutscene thing, but good god, did all that running suck the soul out of me. And it eventually gives you a surfboard tablet thing you can use to go faster, but of course you only get that in the latter half of the game, because it wants you to suffer. It also requires you to unlock the board in each specific area before you can use it in said areas. Also, this game had a stupid obsession with caves, and each cave was the least enjoyable thing to navigate. Puzzles were not puzzles, just chores. Want to open this door? Go all the way back and turn this crystal on, then go around and switch that crystal on. Is it on yet? Nope! You forgot to walk seventy thousand miles back to the start to switch that other one off. :(\n\nAlso, I didn't like Velvet's ending. I feel like they could have given her a better one instead of the freaky ahh ouroboros thingy.

A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 magistralmente contada atrav\u00e9s de cutscenes em tr\u00eas formatos: anime, renderiza\u00e7\u00e3o 3D e em estilo \u201cquadrinhos\u201d, com v\u00e1rias op\u00e7\u00f5es que enriquecem ainda mais o enredo. Apesar de o jogo ser um pouco datado, as cutscenes 3D impressionam pela riqueza de detalhes e nuances das atua\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nA jogabilidade \u00e9 um RPG de a\u00e7\u00e3o com sistema de combos desafiador, mas acess\u00edvel. O jogo vai introduzindo as mec\u00e2nicas aos poucos, mas mesmo ap\u00f3s 20 horas, ainda h\u00e1 novas li\u00e7\u00f5es no tutorial. Apesar disso, com o b\u00e1sico dominado, voc\u00ea pode montar combos de forma aleat\u00f3ria e se divertir apertando os bot\u00f5es sem muita estrat\u00e9gia \u2014 eu mesmo tive que aumentar a dificuldade para \u201cModerado\u201d, pois estava atropelando os inimigos. O mundo \u00e9 semiaberto, com \u00e1reas conectadas e sem loadings percept\u00edveis, e os designs das dungeons, embora previs\u00edveis, cumprem bem seu papel. A trilha sonora \u00e9 excelente, mas alguns temas se repetem e podem grudar na sua cabe\u00e7a. Tales of Berseria me proporcionou uma aventura incr\u00edvel. Gostei da ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o, dos personagens, da trilha sonora, do combate e, principalmente, da hist\u00f3ria e suas reviravoltas.", "timestamp_created": 1736132431, "timestamp_updated": 1736132431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184893081": {"recommendationid": "184893081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041650675", "num_games_owned": 653, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1485, "playtime_at_review": 2706, "last_played": 1737021939}, "language": "english", "review": "Edge Lord goes after God and wants to kill her in law\r\n\r\nPlaying as the anti hero is fun for once", "timestamp_created": 1736131283, "timestamp_updated": 1736131283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184891914": {"recommendationid": "184891914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172746909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2996, "last_played": 1558208029}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is edgelord BS, but there are some redeeming qualities like Magilou.", "timestamp_created": 1736129982, "timestamp_updated": 1736129982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184879276": {"recommendationid": "184879276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108142020", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "playtime_at_review": 1163, "last_played": 1737124119}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043b\u044f, \u043d\u0443 \u0437\u0430 2 \u043a \u0432 2025 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0451\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442, \u0436\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0443", "timestamp_created": 1736116957, "timestamp_updated": 1736116957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184866816": {"recommendationid": "184866816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447971744", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20477, "last_played": 1736104451}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "At\u00e9 o momento, este \u00e9 o meu jogo favorito da s\u00e9rie Tales. Joguei apenas 3, sendo eles o Vesperia, que j\u00e1 finalizei, e o Zestiria, do qual joguei apenas o come\u00e7o. Este texto n\u00e3o \u00e9 exatamente uma an\u00e1lise, mas uma lista dos pontos que me agradaram e dos que n\u00e3o me agradaram no game.\n\nPontos Positivos\nCombate\nDa s\u00e9rie Tales of, at\u00e9 o momento, este foi o combate que mais me agradou. No entanto, ele pode se tornar repetitivo rapidamente se voc\u00ea jogar apenas de um jeito. Recomendo explorar mais o sistema de combate, seja assistindo a v\u00eddeos mostrando os combos, criando seus pr\u00f3prios combos e variando-os de vez em quando, ou utilizando o boneco de treinamento dispon\u00edvel no game, feito pra voc\u00ea treinar. Se fizer isso, sua experi\u00eancia ser\u00e1 muito melhor.\n\nAl\u00e9m disso, recomendo n\u00e3o enfrentar todos os monstros que encontrar pelo caminho, pois isso pode tornar o combate repetitivo. Caso queira enfrent\u00e1-los, prefira lutar contra dois grupos ao mesmo tempo. Isso n\u00e3o apenas aumenta a experi\u00eancia, como tamb\u00e9m reduz o n\u00famero de combates necess\u00e1rios, permitindo que voc\u00ea suba de n\u00edvel naturalmente, sem precisar farmar.\n\nSe o game ficar muito dif\u00edcil, n\u00e3o hesite em alterar a dificuldade pra o modo \"simples\", que \u00e9 o que te d\u00e1 mais experi\u00eancia. Depois, voc\u00ea pode mudar a dificuldade se preferir novamente.\n\nP\u00f3s-Game\nO p\u00f3s-game tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 excelente. Assim que derrotar o chefe final, ainda haver\u00e1 muitas coisas pra se fazer dentro do game, somando assim 15 e 20 horas adicionais de gameplay, ou at\u00e9 mais.\n\nHist\u00f3ria e Personagens\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 outro ponto forte. A protagonista, Velvet, \u00e9 muito interessante, e voc\u00ea realmente compra a busca dela por vingan\u00e7a. Isso, combinado com os demais personagens, que tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o excelentes e muito carism\u00e1ticos, torna tudo perfeito.\n\nMeu personagem favorito \u00e9 o Eizen, devido \u00e0 sua filosofia de vida. Al\u00e9m disso, ele \u00e9 um pirata, o que por si s\u00f3 j\u00e1 \u00e9 maneiro (a steam n\u00e3o aceitou  a outra palavra que coloquei).\n\nDesign e Interface\nOs menus do game, incluindo o invent\u00e1rio, s\u00e3o muito bonitos, com imagens dos personagens e explicando o que cada coisa faz, de forma simples, sem se tornar confuso pra o jogador.\n\nPontos Negativos\nEsquetes\nAs esquetes (pequenos di\u00e1logos de cerca de um minuto e meio) aparecem frequentemente ao longo do game. Embora aprofundem mais os personagens e o universo do game, podem se tornar cansativas. Isso porque, depois de uma longa cena da hist\u00f3ria, essas esquetes v\u00eam logo em sequ\u00eancia, \u00e0s vezes quatro ou mais de uma s\u00f3 vez. Com o tempo, isso pode acabar irritando e at\u00e9 dando vontade de pular esses di\u00e1logos.\n\nTutoriais\nOutro ponto negativo \u00e9 a forma como os tutoriais s\u00e3o apresentados. Muitas vezes, explicam coisas \u00f3bvias, como interagir com uma pedra rachada que pra quebr\u00e1-la, \u00e9 s\u00f3 dar um chute. Al\u00e9m disso, os tutoriais aparecem em excesso e, em algumas ocasi\u00f5es, de forma consecutiva, o que pode ser cansativo.\n\nAp\u00f3s rejogar o game pra platina, passei a gostar ainda mais dele. Aprofundei-me nas mec\u00e2nicas e s\u00f3 confirmei que a hist\u00f3ria, apesar de simples, \u00e9 muito boa, assim como os personagens.\nRecomendo come\u00e7ar por este game se voc\u00ea deseja entrar no universo da s\u00e9rie Tales of. O Arise tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 uma excelente op\u00e7\u00e3o pra quem est\u00e1 come\u00e7ando, mas, se fosse pra recome\u00e7ar hoje, eu escolheria este.\n\nMinha Nota: 9/10", "timestamp_created":

narrative and character development. The shift to anti-heroes is a refreshing take, especially with Velvet Crowe leading the charge. Her journey from a kind-hearted sister to a vengeful daemon is compelling, and her crew of misfits, each with their own dark pasts, adds a rich layer to the story. The pirate theme is brilliantly executed, not just in the aesthetic but in how it influences the gameplay and interactions. The character dynamics, driven by their morally gray choices, make for some of the most engaging dialogues and plot twists in the series. Berseria rekindles that adventurous spirit of the Tales games, but with a darker, more mature edge that I've grown to appreciate over the years. It's a testament to how the series can evolve while keeping its heart intact.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735756932, "timestamp_updated": 1735756932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I will say, that it is even better the 4th playthrough. \nThe combat is very fun if you learn how to properly change your combos in the menu, and you really feel like a raidboss as Velvet. You can literally win most battles even at harder difficulties with just Velvet and one other character. Hitting those huge combos where you chain defeat tons of enemies feels very satisfying, especially with the role-play element of being Velvet and consuming the entire battlefield. \n\nThe music is really good, made by the guy who did all of the other Tales games, and also dark souls games, which is very evident in some of the tracks. \n\nThe story is really great. IMO it has the best story flow and focus than any other JRPG I have played. I am a huge Tales of Symphonia fan, and have played it front-to-back at least 8 times now, but Berseria doesn't have huge sections that feel like a true slog to get through, both gameplay and story wise. \n\nI think that with high difficulty settings, the game's combat actually feels fun. When you understand all of the mechanics, and try to apply them in every instance possible, you will find the combat very engaging. If you just mash buttons and don't know when to breaksoul, you will be completely useless and not have fun as Velvet.

I played on the Steam Deck and for some reason I couldn't get achievements or my play time to be accurately archived. It might have been because I was mostly playing offline. I don't really care though, because after reaching the end of the game, I can confidently tell you that Tales of Berseria was not very fun for me. \r\n\r\nAfter coming off the heels of Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus, I was really looking forward to this game with high expectations. Those are the only two other JRPGs I've played, so I knew that there was always going to be a longggg wind-up duration until I actually started liking the game. So I played 5 hours. Then I reached 10. Then struggled to reach 15. Took a break from the game in order to reach 25 hours... By the time I reached the 30 hour mark, I was committed to just finishing the game, so I had to push myself into playing it.\r\n\r\nUnlike the two aforementioned, there was never a single point in my playthrough when I went to bed and thought, \"wow, I can't wait to play and see what happens tommorow!\" It was always, \"ok, my quota is done. I can't do this game anymore.\" Don't get me wrong: the characters are really interesting and I love their more niche quirks. And there are some really funny moments (coo-coo)!  But I can only handle Violet's character (before she started to really open up/\"REVENGE FOR MY BROTHER\") or \"You are the captain of your soul\"-esque scenes until I started getting tired of it. It's totally in-character for them and understandable, but come on... The combat was a sight to behold with all the flashy movements and skills, but after a while, it just started getting tedious. \r\n\r\nI will say that the last 15 hours of the game were the best part of it. Getting to see everyone's respective story arcs being resolved was great, and the ending graphics during the credits was really sad.
