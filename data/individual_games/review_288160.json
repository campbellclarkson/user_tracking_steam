There's no hiding clues behind something behind the camera or off to the side, or in another room.  The puzzle and solution are always in front of you, which helped with some trickier moments.  Also this is subjective but it felt like the puzzle difficulty was mostly medium to easy, I actually thought some puzzles might be harder, but the solutions turned out to be simpler, which was fine.  This is most true of the first tutorial puzzle which actually had me stumped because I kept looking for a more complex solution or more clues when the solution was quiet simple.\n\nThe second is that once you've completed a puzzle it will 'lock' or put itself away, so you always know what you still have to work on and what is solved, which helped because, there can be several open puzzles and clues happening at the same time.  Which helped because I had halted progress until I realised a component of a puzzle was still interact-able and hadn't been solved yet.  Another aside I liked and is kind of related, when you discover something that solves another component or opens something, the camera will focus on what has changed, so you know where and when progress is happening.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1737171346, "timestamp_updated": 1737171346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185803989": {"recommendationid": "185803989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386529184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1737132655}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the top puzzle games of all time. \nSure its not free moving like portal/manifold garden/Quern/obduction/Talos Principle....so on \n\nIts a click around like the Myst games, besides URU.

As someone who loves to immerse themselves in captivating environments, I can confidently say this game does an exceptional job of drawing you into its mysterious world.\n\nThe story begins with an enigmatic box, and you quickly find yourself unraveling its secrets, only to discover that it\u2019s part of a larger puzzle. As you progress through each level, the narrative slowly unfolds, revealing deeper layers of mystery and intrigue. The sense of discovery never stops\u2014every puzzle you solve leads to another, and each new piece of the story makes you more invested in finding out what\u2019s next. It\u2019s a story that feels more like a journey of exploration and curiosity, drawing you deeper into its web with each passing chapter. The more you solve, the more questions arise, and it keeps you glued to the screen, eager to see what lies beyond the next puzzle.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of The Room is its unique and original concept. Instead of traditional puzzle mechanics, the game revolves around tactile, intricate objects that you interact with in a highly detailed environment. The puzzles aren\u2019t just about solving problems\u2014they\u2019re about physically manipulating the objects around you, engaging with the world in a way that feels fresh and innovative. It\u2019s a concept that stands out in a sea of more conventional puzzle games, and its originality is one of the reasons the game is so compelling.\n\nThe atmosphere is simply well crafted. You're plunged into a world filled with intricate details and a sense of eerie wonder. The dim lighting and subtle design choices keep you on edge, and it feels like there\u2019s always something hidden just around the corner. The environment itself is almost like another character \u2013 one that you're constantly trying to decipher.\n\nThe sound design in The Room is equally fits. The music and ambient sounds seamlessly match the mysterious tone of the game, enhancing the overall experience without overwhelming it. The sound effects, especially when interacting with objects or solving puzzles, feel satisfyingly precise and add to the immersion.\n\nWhen it comes to the puzzles, they strike the perfect balance. I found them neither too easy nor frustratingly difficult. The game provides just enough challenge to make you feel accomplished once you solve something, but never leaves you banging your head against a wall for too long. It\u2019s a rewarding experience that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nThe hint system is another highlight. It\u2019s not overly hand-holding, which I really appreciate. Instead of just giving you the solution, the hints nudge you in the right direction, helping you stay engaged without spoiling the fun. This kept me invested in figuring things out for myself while still offering enough guidance to ensure I wasn\u2019t ever completely lost.\n\nOverall, The Room is a game that I can wholeheartedly recommend. Its perfect combination of atmosphere, puzzle design, and sound creates a captivating experience that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Whether you\u2019re a puzzle enthusiast or just looking for something intriguing, this game will not disappoint. Each new level brings even more immersion, and it\u2019s hard to stop playing once you\u2019ve started. The deeper you go, the more you\u2019ll find yourself invested in both the puzzles and the unfolding mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1736101187, "timestamp_updated": 1736101187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184853850": {"recommendationid": "184853850", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467830732", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1722930287}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u73a9\u9014\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u5207\u5c4f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9bbug\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e38\u620f\u5361\u6b7b......\u6bd5\u7adf\u662f\u8001\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0cthe room\u7cfb\u5217\u662f\u5341\u5206\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1736097699, "timestamp_updated": 1736097699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184847899": {"recommendationid": "184847899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394490777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1700938711}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Otro platino de Puzzles con una tem\u00e1tica un poco m\u00e1s oscura y es de los tipos de juegos que addoro\n\nOpini\u00f3n: 7/10\nDificultad: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1736093645, "timestamp_updated": 1736093645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184845276": {"recommendationid": "184845276", "author": {"steamid": "76561199632027851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1721513048}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like escape rooms but don't have how to play one, this game is a fun option.

Awkward because this game was clearly designed with a mouse in mind, yet the layout selected used ZL, ZR, and the touchpad, but not the touchpad's own button. But passable because it didn't feel bad.\nThe game was also not as responsive as I would have liked to certain button presses. This game's main gimmick is the lens changing how you see things or reveals hidden things. Sometimes I would click it and it wouldn't register. Other times I would click to take it off and it responded by taking it off and immediately putting it back on. So buyer beware that this is not optimal for Steam Deck just because its verified.\n\nI didn't like how one puzzle as well is clearly visible but you can't touch it until you complete the chapter before it. Like why show it at all if you cannot interact with it? Nor did I like how there were instances of literally not being able to see something because of the shadows cast on the item you're examining.

I've heard tons of great things about The Room and it was on a significant sale. Overwhelming positive reviews. Clearly they did something right!\n\nThis isn't a puzzle game. This is an artistic showcase. This is a very beautiful artistic showcase. I may find a way to chock up some more cash directly to the Artists who made these models and animations and made everything so god damn gorgeous. Art is 10/10. \n\nStory is 5/10 - there's a decent overused \"Alchemy\" story being used here, it's got some nice subtle lore drops during the puzzle, nothing intrusive while still having enough of a hook to keep me curious; so it earns itself a 5 or higher. But it's not immersive, it's not original, and it has no purpose. The story could've been about some \"toy maker\" just asking you to test his puzzle boxes and it'd have been the same game. None of the puzzles relate to Alchemy at all. \n\nAnd finally, the puzzles. 2/10 - my intellect was never challenged or provoked. This wasn't a game about figuring something out. This wasn't a game about deducing information or calculating a path. This game considers \"discovering an object\" to be a puzzle, not figuring out a solution. A good puzzle game doesn't force you to click on some arbitrary, non-descriptive symmetrical element of the box to unlock something. Obra Dinn tells you all of the possible names and causes of death; hell it tells you exactly the last memory you saw someone. You have to figure out what happened, but all of the discovery is done for you, not the deduction. Rise of the Golden Idol is similar. It literally tells you what to click on and gives you 35+ words to use, but you have to form the sentences to deduce what is happening in the scene. The discovery is done for you, not the deduction. \n\nThe Room instead decides to call \"Find The Object\" and \"Find The Spot For Object\" as a puzzle. No brain power used.
