The devs have been pointing out these insignificant updates in response to criticism of their work ethic all the while there are game breaking bugs that make it impossible to enjoy the game independent to whether you are a long term, competitive or casual player. My suggestion to the devs would be, first, to allow modding. If you\u2019re not going to fix your games bugs, at least, at very least, put your greed aside and allow your community to do it for you. Secondly, stop making excuses to ignore comments suggesting ideas. Take in what your community wants and build your game around it. Great examples of this are Beamng drive and Project Zomboid. Thirdly, make a roadmap of where you\u2019re going next so that your community is not left in the dark about what the game is going to be in the future.

Gold Mining Simulator  is now developed by a different team than the one originally responsible for creating the game, back when it had a slightly different name.\n\nWhen we took over, our first priority was completing the features the original developers had started, like the quad, dog (with limited abilities since it was our internship side project to help people get into the gamedev) and mini machines to learn more about the project. After that, we shifted our focus to improving the game and fixing bugs, but this has been a big challenge due to the technical debt we inherited.\n\nAbout modding \u2013 we know this is something the community is excited about, and it\u2019s definitely on our radar. That said, implementing modding support will take time, and we want to approach it the right way to ensure it works well for everyone.\n\nWe also want to emphasize that we\u2019re always open to player feedback. We actively read reviews, Steam discussions, social media, and especially Discord. Many of the changes we\u2019ve made recently, like bucket stacking and gold map improvements, came directly from player suggestions. Even Orange Beast DLC was designed for those asking for extended gameplay and bigger machines.\n\nYou mentioned a roadmap, and we completely agree it\u2019s a great idea. We\u2019re actually planning to share our next steps for GMS and the upcoming sequel soon, so stay tuned for that! You can also mention the most needed suggestion and fixes so we can add them to the roadmap ;)\n\nIt\u2019s clear from your feedback and the time you\u2019ve spent in the game that you really care about its potential, and we\u2019re grateful for that. We\u2019d love to have you join the conversation on our Discord. Constructive feedback, especially from dedicated players like you, is what drives us forward and helps us build not only a better GMS but an even stronger sequel.\n\nWhat do you say \u2013 see you on Discord? \ud83d\ude0a\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts!"}, "184365588": {"recommendationid": "184365588", "author": {"steamid": "76561199117695578", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1727363353}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u00e7ok karma\u015f\u0131k bi\u015fey anlamad\u0131m", "timestamp_created": 1735678274, "timestamp_updated": 1735678274, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184336945": {"recommendationid": "184336945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059357226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 30980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 30898, "last_played": 1737043353}, "language": "english", "review": "hi u git this game 5 weeks ago  and i have been in joining it i am a small streamer this game is nice and chill", "timestamp_created": 1735658110, "timestamp_updated": 1735658110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184329032": {"recommendationid": "184329032", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104619855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1735825867}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al principio se puede llegar a hacer algo pesado, sobretodo si no sabes donde hacer todo el tema del principio, adem\u00e1s he creado varias partidas y se nota la diferencia cuando pones que puedas encontrar las pepitas de oro de aproximadamente 20g, pero bueno, que yo lo recomiendo de momento, volver\u00e9 en un tiempo a crear una nueva rese\u00f1a, tiene pinta que cuando ya vas progresando y es m\u00e1s automatizado se disfruta m\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1735652591, "timestamp_updated": 1735652591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184261410": {"recommendationid": "184261410", "author": {"steamid": "76561199480666038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 316, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1737298213}, "language": "czech", "review": "Very Good", "timestamp_created": 1735596839, "timestamp_updated": 1735596839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184256624": {"recommendationid": "184256624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407802004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 645, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1736726729}, "language": "english", "review": "The vehicle dynamics could use an overhaul..
