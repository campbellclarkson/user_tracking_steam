Why are you here? Does it matter? You're here to smash things, and smash you shall.\n\nYou and up to three friends will hack, slash, and spellcast your way through hordes of enemies, all while pretending you\u2019re a team. The shared screen and chaotic battles make for memorable moments, whether you're saving each other from certain doom or \"accidentally\" grabbing the last healing item. Friendships will be tested, gold will be fought over, and someone will inevitably trigger a trap just to see what happens. By the end of the session, you\u2019ll either have bonded over shared triumphs or be drafting a list of reasons to never play with those people again.\n\nThe game\u2019s art style strikes a balance between modern polish and retro aesthetics. The environments are dark and moody, with plenty of hidden secrets and ominous corners to explore. Each dungeon feels alive with traps, treasure, and terrifying hordes.\n\nGauntlet is chaotic, competitive, and fun\u2014if your friendships can survive it. Whether you\u2019re hoarding gold or \"accidentally\" eating someone else\u2019s food, it\u2019s a wild ride you won\u2019t forget.
