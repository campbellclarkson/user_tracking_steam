However, if you are like me, you have time to spare staring mindlessly at your computer while happy music and numbers flash across the screen.\n\n\nThis game is perfect if you can fit into the following criteria:\n\n1) Have played Ragnarok Online before (or are at least interested in it / familiar with it). While the characters are just generic names attached to jobs in the game, the nostalgia really helps this clicker game be more manageable.\n\n2) Have a second monitor. This game is best played when you are doing something else like watching YouTube or playing a less engaging game that you can often click off of. Personally I like playing something like Plants vs Zombies or Loop Hero, where it is easy to pause and go deal with Ragnarok Clicker.\n\n3) Know how to use an auto-mouse feature or be willing to get one (there is an easy free download online). While not necessary, this can really help in boss fights with dealing enough click damage to finish off the boss in the time limit.\n\nAnd that is pretty much it. I often switch it up between wanting to have music and sound on or not, but it is easily a chill game. If you are interested in the game, good luck finding it online somewhere, because Steam has stopped distributing it, even though it is free...", "timestamp_created": 1735442055, "timestamp_updated": 1735442208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 825, "total_negative": 311, "total_reviews": 1136}, "cursors": {"AoJwk8uQlOoCfJavvwE=": "Mon Jan 20 19:20:10 2025"}}
