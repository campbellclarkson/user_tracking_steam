It's Scribblenauts. If, like me, you have immense nostalgia for playing Scribblenauts on your DS and/or iPod Touch as a kid, you'll get a kick out of this game. That's where the appeal lies though - it's difficult to evaluate this since it was such a blatant nostalgia trip for me.\r\n\r\nObjectively, the puzzles are nothing to write home about. An awful lot of them boil down to a character saying something like \"Man, I wish I had a horse!\", so you write \"horse\" and win. If you're looking for a puzzle game that's going to be a challenging or rewarding experience, this isn't really much of either. Similarly, it doesn't do anything groundbreaking as a sandbox, either. Yes, you can make a lot of things, but the vast majority of them are just reskins with the same handful of mechanics. This isn't some complex sim where you can mess around with all kinds of interconnected systems. I also kept getting a bug where the game would whitescreen and need to be Alt+F4ed when Alt-Tabbing - in my 6 hours of playtime, it probably occurred 20 times or so. \r\n\r\nAll of that said, it's Scribblenauts. If you're looking for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, this will more than deliver. If you don't have fond recollections of playing Scribblenauts as a kid, this is a mediocre and somewhat buggy puzzle/sandbox game that isn't great at being either.

You can even use your creativity to spawn things or change characters either to complete the wishes of npcs, or just for fun.\r\n\r\nDue to the way the game is made, each map you get into can be turned into a playground for you to do anything you want, or that comes to your mind. You can give weapons to npcs and make npcs fight each other, you can spawn zombies to zombify other npcs, and many more things. You are literally unrestricted about what you can spawn or what adjectives you can give, unless in the case of some special missions, where some npcs can't be added adjectives to.\r\n\r\nThe way the requests of npcs are done allows you to take broad solutions, either for the best solution ot their problem, or the most stupid or derivative one. For example, a crab creature wanting a house, you can spawn a house for it to it to use the house as its shell, and look very ridiculous. Like seriously, there were many moments where I completed a request with the most ridiculous solution, and ended up bursting in laughter. Beside I also managed to troll a bit on the requests aswell, heh.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you get from doing all the requests in the game done? Well, a huge sandbox you can play with, because the things you can spawn and adjectives you can give to npcs are near limitless. And the best thing is: The state of the stage is saved when you leave, but if you want to reset the stage to play again with it, you can. The game menu allows you to reset the stage to the stage before you begin doing anything, so you can try anything else.\r\n\r\nOf course, the game has some problems. One of them is that sometimes you might be unable to do some things, because you have no idea what adjective to type to change the npc. For example, making a npc eat fish. What adjective would one give to make that happen?\r\nAlso, some adjectives doesn't make sense, like \"Intangible\". Intangible literally means you're untouchable, which could mean you could pass through walls and not be hurt by anything. It not only doesn't allow you to pass through walls, but also allow you to be hurt by npcs. It only make you a bit transparent.\r\n\r\nThe other issue the game has is the skin customization of the player character. By the look is unclear what the buttons does, unless you go trial and error on them. Only later I discovered that clicking a ? button on top-right, and then clicking the buttons will show a tooltip telling what they do.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the game is good, even more if you want to unleash your creativity.", "timestamp_created": 1735450274, "timestamp_updated": 1735450274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184059991": {"recommendationid": "184059991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968362001", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1226, "last_played": 1735444328}, "language": "french", "review": "trop de bugs\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735444406, "timestamp_updated": 1735444406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184059400": {"recommendationid": "184059400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198433890040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3037, "last_played": 1625761226}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "UM JOGA\u00c7O\nINFINITAS POSSIBILIDADES\nda pra se divertir muito tempo", "timestamp_created": 1735443915, "timestamp_updated": 1735443915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184017692": {"recommendationid": "184017692", "author": {"steamid": "76561199591268332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1735419997}, "language": "english", "review": "I been wanting this game for a while, from seeing DanTDM and my other favorite Youtubers play it as a child.
