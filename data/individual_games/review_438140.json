While a few structural flaws do become apparent with repeated play (you have limited control over your gameplan, and the RNG gods sometimes decide to make sure all your best cards show up at bad moments), these are nothing compared to the sheer delight you'll experience when your deck starts going off. I picked this game up just a few months ago, and I've logged several hundred hours playing both paper and online against friends and strangers alike. Absolutely worth your time and money.\r\n\r\nAlso, the weekly Arenas are a genuine delight. I've found some amazing variations to play that way, and rethinking my strategies to take advantage of these variant rules keeps the game feeling as fresh as the day I picked it up.\r\n\r\nFinally, their customer service team is top notch, and very helpful if you run into issues! \r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and try it out!", "timestamp_created": 1736345048, "timestamp_updated": 1736345048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184991621": {"recommendationid": "184991621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089117313", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 3775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 3775, "deck_playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1736223511}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game to kill time.

It works perfectly on the Steam Deck and, as I mentioned earlier, on your smartphone too. This is a free-to-play game, but the DLC is worth it as it adds new features and functions to the game.\n\nThere\u2019s also a campaign mode, but most players can complete it in under 12 hours.
