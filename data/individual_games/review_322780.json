Sometimes you just fall in love. People, places, games. This one was mine. It's not like I don't remember the wealth of bugs and bad times, but they just didn't matter to me. I loved everything that this game was trying to do, and there are so many things to choose from. The floating-island setting, the aesthetic, the storm walls, the music, the progression, the grapple system, the ship building, the community. Everything.\n\nYou built your scrappy vessel from scratch, out of materials you gathered yourself. And then you would take this wanting home with you, trying to survive the dangers of this world and of your own. With many failures and reprisals, you would slowly gain the knowledge to transform yourself and your flying ship into a celestial marvel to be reckoned with.\n\nI really could go on and on, gushing about each facet of the game I mentioned, and more. I could talk about the people I found inspiring, of Meister Keen's ideals, of Xerzie's knowledge, of Lexhy's islands, of Loryenne's art. I have written it. I've erased it. It's sad, but it simply doesn't matter anymore. You had to be there.\n\nThankfully, there's a certain game on the horizon that I believe will be worth hoping for again.", "timestamp_created": 1735805915, "timestamp_updated": 1735805915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565741240978240967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183538573": {"recommendationid": "183538573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050446065", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1553056266}, "language": "english", "review": "Waster", "timestamp_created": 1735015691, "timestamp_updated": 1735015691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 3522, "total_negative": 2001, "total_reviews": 5523}, "cursors": {"AoJwh+HVrYMDcP650wM=": "Mon Jan 20 17:55:24 2025"}}
