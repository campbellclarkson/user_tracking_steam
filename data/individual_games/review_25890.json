Definitely different from HOI4!  I enjoy that I can control almost every little detail of the gameplay without automating the units.  I just set the game speed to the second lowest and have the message settings set to pause the game when my units are attacked or when I win or lose a battle so I can react to each of the MANY events that require my immediate attention.  It definitely feels more like I'm making decisions and issuing orders from the strategic level all the way down to the tactical level.  Don't get me wrong - there is a STEEP learning curve!  I'm still finding mechanics that give me more options (underground resistance cells can spawn others in adjacent provences). All of your supplies, upgrades, reinforcements, production queue, and consumer goods are created from one pool of \"Industrial Capacity\" that needs constant attention and allocation.  You need to balance your leadership points between research, diplomacy, espionage, and officer training.  You have to decide what you will research with the finite pool of leadership points you have!  You will overlook critical research because it has a mundane name and description until you read and understand the stats boost it gives.  These might not be selling points if you're looking for a point-and-click, automated game that looks like it would be more comfortable on your phone.  It may not have the 3D animated sprites of infantry running in place at each other as they attack and defend 3D terrain.  It may not have railway guns, mulberry harbors, or supply depots.  It will challenge you.  It will make you feel stupid at times.  You will experience CRUSHING defeats - and you will come back and fight harder than before!  I whole-heartedly recommend this game for anyone who wants to spend months of their spare time slogging it out on the Eastern Front, or in the jungles and alpine plateaus of South America, or ANYWHERE.  Can I give this game six stars?  PDX should be making games like this still! Buy it! Play it!
