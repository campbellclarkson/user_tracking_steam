years worth of development and this game is still a clunky nightmare with so many conflicting ideas. Survival is very underbaked and tedious; while the idea is there, the execution is just a grindfest at a snail's pace to accomplish a few goals with no finish line. \r\nAnd when it comes to the engineering portion of this game, that isn't even too great either. All thrusters, no matter where they're placed, push through the center of mass, so you're very limited in things like differential yaw and the like. Conveyors are nonsensical and flow both directions, only pulling items when requested, (but can still get backed up) which makes for a clunky attempt at logistics inside a craft; only resolved when using sorters set to drain all excessively. There's no atmospheric simulation, no lift, and no reason to do anything but just spam thrusters on a craft and call it a day.\r\nThe UI and general readability of things is the worst of all, being an actual nightmare. Because of how conveyors work, you're often getting completely wrong readouts when crafting materials, and there's a lot of invisible nonsense elements to a block that aren't actually told to you until you navigate into its control panel. Things like hydrogen and oxygen inside conveyor networks are completely invisible to the player without using a control panel, and the control panel itself is incredibly clunky and terrible to use. It's apparently too much to ask to simply look at a block and get its information at a glance for this game.\r\nYes, there's mods that fix much of these things, but that's a pretty bad excuse. This game might as well be called Space Programmers because of the amount of reliability on using the control panel, naming block groups, and screwing around with some very limited, baked-in settings.\r\n\r\nThis game is not that great unless you dump a lot of mods into it. I really wanted to like this one, but it's an absolute mess of ideas; and don't get me started on the \"cosmetic\" DLCs. Much of those blocks are cosmetic, but there is unironically advantages that come with some of them. \r\nGo play From The Depths instead if you want an actual engineering game.

But before I tell you why, first let me make one thing clear. Vanilla Space Engineers is NOT an engineering game. I don\u2019t think the devs even know what we (engineers) actually do. This is a space sandbox game where vanilla players can only slap pieces together and determine what works through trial and error. Maybe you have the thruster-to-battery ratio correct for your atmospheric ship, maybe not \u2013 you\u2019ll find out when you\u2019re done building.\r\n\r\nFortunately, SE is very mod friendly and the mod community is stellar. The game provides a great framework for all kinds of creative and useful add-ons. Want to build a Death Star and have a laser battle with the Enterprise? Go right ahead. You can probably even find blueprints of both ships ready-to-go on the workshop. Looking to race custom rovers across Mars? Super easy. Craving epic PvP battles with custom-built weapons and AI-piloted drones? This is absolutely the right game for that.\r\n\r\nFor me, the biggest thrill is that the right mods can turn SE into a really great design game (the Build Info mod by Digi is an absolute must-have if you want to properly plan a build) with the ability to create an infinite variety of constructs from scratch and customize them to do whatever you want. The in-game Programming Block, while limited and a bit clunky at times, is an amazing gift to players like me who are willing to invest the time in writing code to make their builds do things no one else has ever conceived of.\r\n \r\nIn many ways, this is one of those games with possibilities as endless as your imagination. It is so open-ended and easily adapted that creative-minded players have spent thousands of hours without getting bored. You can even set up your own solar systems and script scenarios (objective-based stories that you can play through) there for other players. The icing on top is that even 11 years in the devs are still adding more content and fresh ideas, both free and in the form of additional DLCs.\r\n\r\nThat said, no game is right for everyone. The developer-written scenarios are sparse on story and all the NPCs are AI-piloted ships. So, if you\u2019re looking for a game with lots of lore and interesting characters, this is not for you. Also, the initial learning curve is quite steep if you don\u2019t watch at least the first of their introductory videos. \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1737008124, "timestamp_updated": 1737008124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185691690": {"recommendationid": "185691690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973399782", "num_games_owned": 910, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 9597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2207, "playtime_at_review": 9174, "last_played": 1737386991}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a classic, and well worth your time if you like building, crafting vehicles and light survival Spacer Engineers has you covered.

Yet it didnt felt wasted its still fun. U can mine like minecraft and PVE and survival makes it more fun to start a new world. On new year I had my spaceship done and flew into space it was a big ship. Took me 100 hours in month. My steam record never loved pirated games so our experience is hidden. But this game changes your life because of creation mode. U can build cars, bases or even mix it and make a carbase or flying base. Thanks to simple but yet complex u can make anything almost thanks to the cubic shape design of building. The bad part is u need DLC. I rather pay 1 game even if its stays at 60 bucks. Let me tell U I played space engineers before on pirated versions and why I wanted to buy it. So right after release I had free copy and bought it to just say please make the game one and not multiple please. Even tho dlc is worth it I believe skins are good moneymaker. If not for 1 then 2 because getting locked out to keep playing is what SE 1 needed right..... like league of legends. U get the idea if I tell u tomorrow I hear league of legends is going bankrupt I go buy Card and buy skins. For me thats important that guy and only gamers understand this and if im wrong just delete my whole steam account again.

entering steam as Beta/EarlyAccess game, developers had a ton of promises: about survival, about NPCs, about new blocks/items and a ton more stuff. Around that time I bought SE1 because I wanted to support the Devs and live to see a full release of the game with all the promised features implemented. \nWell... As we all can see - they never finished the game. They grabbed some money from selling unfinished game, they grabbed some more money from selling DLCs, they grabbed even more money from selling skins in steam, and guess what?\nNow they are promising the SAME stuff they promised YEARS ago and want to get more money for it. Not because they actually did something and are ready to release it - no, it would be too good to be true. They want more money for the same PROMISES. Not for new content - for promises.\n\nSE1 multiplayer? the only thing that they actually implemented as promised\nMedieval engineers? Abandoned\nSE1 planets? added to justify the time spent developing MedievalEngineers\nSE1 new objects/mechanics? mostly locked via PAID DLCs\nSE1 survival? Abandoned\nSE1 combat/lore/NPCs?

I always just have within me a desire to play a game where like the whole point is to  build a space ship and other assorted complex systems and this game 100% lives in that realm. So, I'm kinda just gonna go into a list of Pros & Cons here.\r\nPros:\r\n1) it runs super well\r\n2) it's surprisingly simple to build pretty much anything that you want including some more in depth AI or other less in depth systems\r\n3) it's super easy to mode you don't even have to close the game to mod it and they host pretty much all of them on the steam workshop \r\n4) you can use programmable blocks to add all sorts of in game systems and just like the mods you can download some directly from the steam workshop so you don't even have to program it yourself \r\nCons:\r\n1) It can be a bit of a rough start because it can be pretty complex so make sure that you start with the scenario about learning to play \r\n2)the scenarios aren't super well structured and don't seem to have any actual NPC's so they're not the most exciting \r\n3)it can be a little difficult to decide what you want to make since there isn't much story \r\n4) fighting is actually really difficult in the game so like there are times when you're in a building and your killed with like a single shot before you even notice it happens. space battles can be pretty difficult too like you definitely want some sort of AI for that stuff\r\n\r\nSo all in all it's a really fun game and I love it so much but it seems to be mostly about building", "timestamp_created": 1736147457, "timestamp_updated":

Played quite a bit of this.\r\nI have mostly considered my time as game development time, as after awhile I got fed up with the UI. However, for Space Engineers I, there is enough DLC to clear up any Quality Of Life things, and most have been addressed in the regular patches and expansions (free ones) however as the DLC is very cheap I have picked it up as I went to support the continued developement.\r\n\r\nWith Space Engineers II in the 'post', Make sure you get SE I on sale :P, as I write this review I am busy reinstalling SE I (with all DLC) to play around making spaceships in sandbox [which is my thing]. I have already ordered SE II and the videos are getting me excited [to many update/upgrades to list].\r\n\r\nSE currently has a very dedicated community, great developer support and whole 'theamed' servers to join in with mates. Its fun regard less if you play in an iorn man survival mode, or creative where you want your mates to help or enjoy bashing your creations against each other (or both). The development of a turnament type server community run (abit like watching an EVE Online turnament with more bent metal) is quite good fun.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, the basics you will get quick. How deep you go (ie making GPS targeting balistic missile weapons from an automated construction/launch platform) is upto you. But its got fun base building, spaceship building, drone building, survival, factorium type vibe. Do what you like, including make a server with your mates with your own workshop add-ins to play it your way so you only do the bits your enjoy.\r\n\r\nMaybe watch a few more recent videos on youtube if your not sure, I would recomend the most recent starter videos to get a tastes (and not to waste your 'try-it' time).

I had to spend probably an hour watching some chads videos on youtube because the game completely lacks a meaningful tutorial. No explanation of how to manage a refinery, no explanation of how to build ships. Once you spawn into survival, you either A, Watch a youtube tutorial, B, Bash your head against the wall until you figure it out, or C, Get mad and refund the game.\n\n2 - The grind. I have probably spent like 4 hours in my survival world, and most of it was grinding. Theres nothing to do early game, because all you do is stare at your screen and dig. Normally this would be fine, like having some sort of gameplay while digging, but no. A major part of the game is just looking at your screen, and shedding a single tear wondering if you should be playing in creative instead.\n\nMining is a major part of the game, and i would rather be fighting skeletons and zombies in a minecraft cave then look like coralines dad staring at the computer.\n\n4 - NPC's. There are no true NPCs. The most you will get is a random ship flying past you, so far away theres no point in even going over there. I heard this is being fixed in space engineers 2.\n\nPostitives\n\n5 - Creation. The ship building in this game is wonderful! once you understand how it works its like drawing. I have created an entire fleet, from fuel tankers to ships with giant guns and no point defense, all made to work around eachother. A corvette could defend a destroyer from fighters, or a carrier could assist in a planetary invasion from orbit.\n\n6 - Combat. The combat is great, instead of decreasing your ships HP or something, a railgun shot would go straight through your heavy armor, and mess up all the vulnerable pipes and tubes in the bowels of your ship. You can build AI fighters that don't need other players to pilot them, ICBM's to obliterate entire battleships.\n\nTldr, survival is hell and i want to stop staring at rocks.\n\n6.2/10 Please don't

I spent over an hour designing my first rover. It exploded after i hit a tiny bump in the terrain and the vehicle flipped spinning and exploding. Next truck fell in a ditch and was impossible to extract. 3rd and 4th trucks exploded after similar loss of control and destruction as the first. It's just incredible how easily it is to destroy your pieces of work in this game. Like i feel like, after 24 hours of play, this game is more of an \"unbuilder\" than a \"builder\" genre. \n\nI really like the designing and building of this game but i also really don't want to invest hours into building a truck only to have it explode in minutes after i hit literally a 1 ft. tall hill in the terrain. This is just early game too. I really REALLY dont want to invest 10s of hours into building a capital ship only to have it explode from bumping into an asteroid of something similarly stupid. \n\nIn short this game is too punishing to be fun. There is no way to turn off block damage from accidents without turning off block damage entirely. It's honestly a major oversight by the game developers imo. I understand you want a challenging game but make it possible to play on easier modes for the casuals like me. \n\nPlayed a bit more. I restarted games over and over trying to find a good spawn planet. I saved the game once before loading in so i could re-load from the launch point instead of creating a new game every time. Turns out auto-save saves over existing files instead of creating a new file. \n\nThe saving function is just dumb. Whats the point of making a save if it gets auto-saved over in a matter of seconds? I literally saved prior to exploring a planet base because i was worried id get shot at by this place. Drive up to the border and immediately get blown up by automated turrets. I go to re-load my save but its been overwritten the moment i died by the auto-save function. Please tell me why you make the auto-saves save over player saves? what the hell is the point of saves if it gets deleted by auto-save functions? The only way to make saves work is to make two saves of different names at the same time so the auto-save saves only just one of the manual saves. Honestly its a horribly designed save function. \n\nI disabled auto-save which will probably have unforeseen consequences in the future. I'm extremely frustrated with this game. I'll give it a few more hours but i'm not optimistic at this point. I foresee my game experience ending when i put hours and hours of work into a ship only to have it blow up like paper in a matter of seconds.\n\nWith about 10 more hours played i can finally recommend this game with strong cautions for casual players and/or players new to gaming. The game has intrigued me enough to keep trying where i have failed and i can say it DOES get better, much better.\n\nEdit:\n\nI will keep all I've said above because those things are all still relevant. The game is not well suited for casual players and doesn't offer easy enough difficulty settings for me to recommend it to them. \n\nPersonally i consider myself a casual gamer and i almost rage quit multiple times during the first 30 hours of play. I actually uninstalled it once after my jet (which took five hours to build) immediately crashed and exploded after takeoff. After that i gave it some time but found myself thinking about how i was going to fix the jet. I reinstalled the game and got to fixing. The jet now runs smoothly, takes off fine (and lands). \n\nThe save function is just bad. Make auto-saves save new files, not over old ones. To counter this I've been making many many save files but its just poor design. \n\nThe learning curve of this game is very real and difficult. Though someone who is acquainted with basic physics and algebra may not find this difficult, i feel i can safely say anyone else will find the mechanics frustrating. I went and re-taught myself Newtons laws, something i hadn't thought about since high school. I researched thrust and lift. I learned about gravitational pull and magnetism. I've spent time reading about the Apollo missions and the challenges that physicists faced launching rockets in real life. \n\nIn my opinion this is actually a highlight of the game; It forces you to learn real life laws about things like gravity and inertia in order to progress through the game. The mechanics of the game are still very simplified compared to real life but the laws of the game follow the laws of real life. After learning these things i was able to fix my ships so they won't flip over or crash randomly which was very satisfying. \n\nI'm scared for combat. That looks painful. So far i've only attempted combat once. Flew my flying fortress (basically a B-52 with a ton of turrets) to a hostile surface facility. After 10 seconds of engagement i had blocks being blasted off of my ship, debris flying everywhere. Turned around and haven't gone back yet. \n\nI've expanded my base, built a new mining specific outpost and numerous smaller outposts. I have 2 land vehicles and 3 atmospheric vehicles including 1 combat vessel and 2 mining vessels. I'm most proud of my Phidippus, a mining barge (i named myself). My next order of business is to send a rocket to space to expand my operations into orbit. I am modeling the craft after the Saturn V Apollo mission rockets. It will carry a small craft attached with solar panels and carrying enough resources for me to begin a space station. \n\nThere are a TON of aesthetic options for building ships and vehicles. You can put a lot of time into making crafts look fancy or hardly any time if you don't care about looks. The crafting system is very expansive with many options. The crafting interface is a bit clunky but workable. \n\n\n\nSome tips for new players:\n\n    - Turn on center of gravity under the \"Info\" tab. Make sure you place your gyroscope over \n      the center of gravity. Make sure your engines or wheels are evenly spaced around the \n      center of gravity. \n\n    - Build an Assembler and Refinery as soon as possible. They are much faster than the \n      basic assembler and basic refinery. \n\n    - Build a small mining ship or truck early. They are vastly more efficient than mining by \n      hand. \n\n    - Wind turbines get better wind when they are higher up, 8 blocks above the ground is the \n      going consensus. \n\n    - When in doubt do some research. You will save yourself alot of time by learning the \n      correct way to do things before attempting blind. I am still researching new mechanics \n      when i play even after 30 hours of game play. \n\n    - Save often! \n\n8/10. I bought this game on sale. For $10 this game is very worth it. $20 is also very reasonable and worth. This concludes my conflicting positive review.

I don\u2019t want to die, but I\u2019ll fail at both.\"\n\nAfter reading the note, I mustered the courage to enter the ship.\nWeapon in hand, I stepped inside.\nThe interior was as wrecked as the exterior.\nDoors weren\u2019t working, and the lighting system was barely functional.\n\nOnce I realized there was no immediate danger, I relaxed.\nI holstered my weapon and took out my welder.\nThe ship\u2019s design intrigued me.\nUsing the welder, I began studying how the ship was constructed.\nAfter all, I\u2019m a Space Engineer \ud83d\ude05\n\nAs I continued exploring, I found a crate.\nIt contained some useful items.\nFrom the crate, I learned that if I didn\u2019t claim the ship, it would eventually disappear.\nI claimed the ship without hesitation.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t that simple.\nClaiming it only prevented the ship from vanishing.\nI had to hack and rebuild every part to make it truly mine.\n\nThis was an incredible opportunity\u2014\nI could have a massive ship with minimal effort.\nRepairing a pre-built ship would also greatly improve my space engineering skills.\nI got to work immediately.\n\nI disassembled the intact parts of the ship to rebuild them as my own.\nHowever, there weren\u2019t many usable parts left.\nI needed more raw materials.\n\nMy base was about 5 km away.\nI decided to head home and return with my ship.\nAfter all, my ship could carry much more than I could.\n\nAt home, I refueled my jetpack and recharged my energy.\nThen I started loading materials onto my ship.\n\nAt that moment, I had an idea.\nI could build a welder on my ship, so it could repair and build without me manually carrying materials.\nInstead of building a new ship, I modified my mining ship, replacing its drills with welders.\n\nAfter the modification, I double-checked everything and set off.\nWhen I arrived, I got to work.\nBut something was wrong\u2014the welder on my ship wasn\u2019t working.\n\nTo solve this, I needed to return home, but it was a long journey.\nSince I\u2019d already brought materials here, I decided to do the repairs manually.\n\nAfter exhausting the materials, I returned home.\nOn the way, I watched welder ship videos on the Space Engineers database (a.k.a. YouTube) for inspiration.\n\nI realized the problem:\nThe connection points of the welder didn\u2019t match my ship\u2019s design.\nThis was enlightening because I\u2019d faced this issue before but never understood the cause.\n\nInstead of further modifying my ship, I reverted it back to a drilling ship and started building a new ship from scratch.\n\nThis new ship was designed for my specific needs\u2014\nsmaller, more mobile, and easier to maneuver.\nOnce it was complete, I loaded it with materials and set off again.\n\nAfter a few more trips, I discovered a significant problem:\nThe ship I was repairing wasn\u2019t a flyable ship\u2014it was a stationary object.\n\nWhenever I tried to convert it into a mobile ship, I encountered errors.\nThis terrified me.\nHad I been repairing an immovable object all along?\n\nDesperate, I scoured the Space Engineers database to see if anyone had faced a similar issue.\nI found an answer:\nThe ship couldn\u2019t have any parts or terrain within 3-4 meters of its structure.\n\nI halted repairs and started excavating.\nThe digging was long and exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t even sure it would work.\nThis uncertainty was draining.\n\nEach time, I dug, tried to convert the ship, and failed.\nI was close to giving up.\n\nBut more engineers in the database confirmed that digging should solve the problem.\n\nSo I dug relentlessly.\nEventually, I cleared a ship-sized space underneath it.\n\nFinally, it worked.\nI was overjoyed\u2014my efforts weren\u2019t in vain.\n\nHowever, there was another problem.\nWhen I converted the ship into a mobile object, some parts exploded or got damaged.\n\nThankfully, this happened in a simulation.\nIf I had done it for real, the ship would have been destroyed.\n\nI kept testing and discovered the cause:\nA small piece of terrain was embedded in the ship.\nIt was a bizarre, floating piece of land.\n\nThis single fragment defied physics and was the source of all my problems.\n\nAfter multiple simulations, I managed to remove it without heavily damaging the ship.\n\nAt last, I converted the ship into a mobile object.\n\nIt worked! The ship could fly!\n\nBut as soon as it lifted off, it tilted to the left and exploded.\nThat\u2019s when I realized\u2014it didn\u2019t have a gyroscope.\n\nI returned home, gathered materials, and installed the gyroscope, along with a few other missing components.\n\nFinally, after several trials, I got the ship to hover without issues.\nIt was massive and heavy, making maneuvering difficult.\n\nIt lacked left thrusters entirely, so turning and stopping were a challenge.\nDespite its flaws, I decided to bring it home.\n\nThe journey was nerve-wracking.\nBy the time I arrived, the ship had only 2 minutes of power left.\nIt barely hovered, so I tilted it to the right to keep it steady and rushed to build a connection bridge.\n\nWith all my materials on the ship, I had to craft everything from scratch.\n\nIt was a race against time.\nI dug, welded, built, and connected like a true Space Engineer.\n\nFinally, with less than a minute to spare, I docked the ship.\n\nI had a new ship now, and its name was\u2014Mjolnir.", "timestamp_created": 1735486394, "timestamp_updated": 1735486394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522222220897674561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184107800": {"recommendationid": "184107800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043827103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3237, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1737319137}, "language": "english", "review": "Great for all the engineers at heart.", "timestamp_created": 1735485959, "timestamp_updated": 1735485959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184104212": {"recommendationid": "184104212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855884990", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15848, "last_played": 1721928645}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, I had alot of fun playing these is many years and still does.

There's no real \"game\" in any traditional sense, and while there is a so-called Survival Mode there's really not a lot you need to survive from.   The whole purpose of the game (and really I should just call it \"software\") is just creatively building things and trying to make them work the way you envisioned.\n\nThere's a huge palette of available blocks, bricks and special items which interact in dizzying combinations under a fairly realistic physics system.    Trying to build your first ship that can actually fly in the Earthlike planet's atmosphere and then continue up to break orbit and function in outer space is a real test of ingenuity.   You can come up with infinite numbers of engineering problems and then test your ability to build a solution -- but there's no actual point to doing so. \n\nI've waited for years for this game to evolve beyond just being a brick-building simulation and develop some kind of gameplay (or at least gameplay that didn't hinge on bored kids throwing massive dreadnaughts at each other while screaming for the entertainment of nonexistent YouTube audiences),  but it never materalized.   Much like their earlier Medieval Engineers game, this one seems to have been set aside and now they're working on Space Engineers 2.   I can't tell if SE2 is just a graphical upgrade to this software  or if it will actually have some semblance of a video game included.\n\nIf you like building complex and sometimes comical contraptions in a sci-fi space setting, this game is a good way to scratch the itch.    I spent many many hours building vehicles which served very specific functions; huge planetary crawlers for strip mining worlds, VTOL Search and Rescue aircraft with compact survival functions, planetary scout rovers and dedicated ships to pluck them off the surface and carry them into space, etc etc etc.   Dozens of hours designing and executing and testing purpose-built vehicles that had no purpose, because there was no real game world for them to exist in.\n\nI would love to see the concepts and construction of Space Engineers someday applied into a living, breathing simulated galaxy.  A mining vehicle that needs to be efficient because you need to sell the ore to buy the fuel to replace your missiles and upgrade your base, fill your oxygen tanks and make repairs and do it all over again.   I'd love to see that game.\n\nIn the meantime, this one's pretty fun to just mess around in for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1735442795, "timestamp_updated": 1735442795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184056366": {"recommendationid": "184056366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092994874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 6688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6688, "last_played": 1735543292}, "language": "japanese", "review": "[h1]\uff1c\u826f\u3044\u70b9\uff1e[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*][u]\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u91cd\u6a5f\u3084\u8eca\u4e21\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u308b[/u]\n\u3000\u7269\u7406\u6f14\u7b97\u306b\u306f\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u899a\u3048\u308c\u3070\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u307e\u3067\u306f\u306d\u2026\u3002\n[/olist]\n\u3000\n[h1]\uff1c\u60aa\u3044\u70b9\uff1e[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*][u]\u4f55\u3092\u3059\u308b\u306b\u3082\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308a\u3059\u304e\u308b[/u]\n\u3000\u9271\u7269\u306e\u6398\u524a\u3082\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u3059\u308b\u306b\u3082\u3001\u5b9f\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306b\u3082\u304b\u306a\u308a\u306e\u81a8\u5927\u306a\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b\u3002\n\u3000\u6587\u5b57\u901a\u308a\u9577\u5e74\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306a\u3089\u9ad8\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3067\u304d\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u57df\u306b\u9054\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u79c1\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6642\u9593\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306f\u5230\u5e95\u8db3\u308a\u306a\u3044\u6a21\u69d8\u3002\n\u3000youtube\u7b49\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u7247\u3063\u7aef\u304b\u3089\u5168\u3066\u898b\u308b\u3050\u3089\u3044\u306e\u6c17\u5408\u304c\u8981\u308b\u3002\n\u3000\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4f55\u3092\u3059\u308b\u306b\u3082\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u305d\u306e\u9593\u306b\u71b1\u304c\u51b7\u3081\u3066\u98fd\u304d\u305f\u3002\n\u3000\u98fd\u304d\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306b\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3001\u6398\u524a\u5834\u3068\u79fb\u52d5\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u5efa\u8a2d\u306e\u307f\u3002\n\u3000\n[*][u]\u30ac\u30c1\u3067\u76ee\u7684\u304c\u4f55\u3082\u306a\u3044[/u]\n\u3000\u306e\u3067\u3001\u4e0a\u8ff0\u306e\u901a\u308a\u98fd\u304d\u305f\u3089\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u3002\n[/olist]\n\u3000\n[h1]\uff1c\u7dcf\u8a55\uff1e[/h1]\n\u3000\u91cd\u6a5f\u3084\u8eca\u4e21\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u5efa\u8a2d\u306b\u611b\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3002\n\u3000\u305d\u306e\u4e0b\u6e96\u5099(\u77e5\u8b58\u306e\u4ed5\u5165\u308c\u3092\u542b\u3080)\u306b\u81a8\u5927\u306a\u6642\u9593\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u5104\u52ab\u306b\u611f\u3058\u308b\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u5411\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1735441334, "timestamp_updated": 1735860131, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184055649": {"recommendationid": "184055649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362305335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 491, "playtime_at_review": 4237, "last_played": 1736647431}, "language": "english", "review": "drillin and buildin drillin and buildin 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1735440741, "timestamp_updated": 1735440741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184047546": {"recommendationid": "184047546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369735195", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 51670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "playtime_at_review": 51614, "last_played": 1736383781}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very creative and fun game.

"review": "The greatest sandbox game that never realised its potential. Just another sad story of the developers taking a promising concept in the wrong direction and ruining it.\r\n\r\nDesigning and building your own spaceships is fun, exploring and scavenging is fun, the (mostly) realistic physics simulation is fun, and scaling and automating your resource management is fun... Until you get to the point where you've built it all and realise you basically have nothing to use any of it for. Shooting down some dumb cargo ships that just drift lifelessly through space? That's seriously it?\r\n\r\nThe game is so good at distracting you with micro-goals right up until you get to the finish line, and then there's this defining moment where you take your ship out for the first time for a test flight, and do nothing. Let me tell you: Space has never felt so empty. You suddenly realise that this has all been a big waste of time and it sucks.\r\n\r\nI guess the developers envisage you playing this game with your friends and competing with them, but the buggy multiplayer and lack of players prevent that from being fun. I only play singleplayer, and this game has none.\r\n\r\nThis game has (had) the best foundations for the most enjoyable and satisfying sandbox game ever. There's nothing else quite like it. In early builds that had you exploring the asteroid field it was all so promising. All they needed was to implement NPCs, improve the code a little to allow a faster max speed and fewer bugs, add an endgame goal like building some structures or an opposing faction to overcome and the game could have been feature-complete and the best in its genre.\r\n\r\nThen the developers wasted years adding pointless glitchy 'planets' to the game that provided nothing to do, never fixed the most important bugs and never added an actual goal to the game... I hadn't played this game for years. I loaded it up since then and there's been some pottering around with the code, paid DLC added and nothing done to address the vacuous void where the actual game should be. And now they're releasing a sequel with the main selling point being a more detailed building system? That's not what's wrong with the game! What are you guys DOING?\r\n\r\nI think of this game from time to time. I'll often get the itch to make a new world and feel that feeling of freedom, surviving, salvaging resources, gradually improving and upgrading my ship, working on new designs and possibilities, and then... Oh yeah. Then nothing. I spent so many hours playing this game thinking it was something else, and I will always keep wanting to come back to that amazing game that actually never existed, only to remember each time that defining moment of incredible disappointment.", "timestamp_created": 1735415562, "timestamp_updated": 1735415562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708149254322052002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184022941": {"recommendationid": "184022941", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977331520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 319662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1757, "playtime_at_review": 315611, "last_played": 1737350834}, "language": "english", "review": "Block based Space themed building game, that allows an individual to use their imagination.

Developed by Keen Software House, this game challenges players to build, explore, and survive in the depths of space and on planetary surfaces.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nAt its core, Space Engineers is a physics-driven sandbox. Players can construct ships, stations, vehicles, and more, using a robust building system that encourages creativity and problem-solving. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to collaborate or compete in building massive space stations or battling with intricately designed warships.\r\n\r\nThe survival mode adds an extra layer of challenge, requiring resource gathering, power management, and environmental adaptation. Creative mode, on the other hand, offers unlimited resources for unrestricted construction and experimentation.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Performance\r\nVisually, Space Engineers is impressive, featuring detailed textures, realistic lighting, and a stunning sense of scale. The game's physics engine is a standout, accurately simulating weight, inertia, and destruction. However, this realism comes at a cost; performance can dip during large-scale builds or intense battles, even on high-end systems.\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\nComplexity and Depth: The engineering mechanics are deep, offering endless possibilities for players to design functional (or fantastical) machines.\r\nFreedom and Creativity: From recreating real-world spacecraft to designing entirely original constructs, the only limit is your imagination.\r\nActive Community and Mod Support: The community-driven modding scene adds immense value, with countless mods available to enhance gameplay, add features, or introduce entirely new elements.\r\nRealistic Physics: The simulation aspects, such as gravity, momentum, and structural integrity, make creations feel meaningful and grounded in science.\r\nWeaknesses\r\nSteep Learning Curve: New players may feel overwhelmed by the complexity, and the tutorial system could be more robust.\r\nOccasional Bugs and Glitches: The game\u2019s ambitious scope sometimes results in bugs, especially in multiplayer.\r\nPerformance Limitations: Large builds or intense multiplayer sessions can strain even powerful PCs.\r\nConclusion\r\nSpace Engineers is a must-play for fans of engineering, exploration, and science fiction. While its complexity and occasional performance issues might deter some, those who invest the time will find an endlessly rewarding experience. Whether you\u2019re building a humble rover or a massive spacefaring fleet, Space Engineers inspires creativity like few other games.\r\n\r\nWho It\u2019s For: Fans of sandbox games, sci-fi enthusiasts, and anyone who loves designing and building.\r\n\r\nWho It\u2019s Not For: Those seeking fast-paced action or players who prefer more guided gameplay experiences.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735256706, "timestamp_updated": 1735256706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183807996": {"recommendationid": "183807996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355102160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 863, "last_played": 1735352016}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like games like scrap mechanic or trailmakers you would really enjoy this.", "timestamp_created": 1735254317, "timestamp_updated": 1735254317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183801328": {"recommendationid": "183801328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004413298", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 23466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23466, "last_played": 1728596906}, "language": "english", "review": "The New Research point buy thing is moronic.

I want to love this game, I really do, and I've only kept playing it this long because my mind keep urging me to play it, but I leave unsatisfied each and every time.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's great gems in the modding scene (that fix the errors the devs made) but I really don't care to go digging into that when I mainly want to play on a server with friends, where I'm held back in block diversity by not spending another $30 on DLC (on sale), constantly struggling to find resources because the ore detector range is laughable, and constantly annoyed by how easy it is to lose progress. \r\n\r\nIn my first game I played maybe 10 hours and was really enjoying it, with a small base and rover. Went on some expeditions and was going great, so I logged out. Came back to my rover despawned, because it was 1 block below the despawn threshold and it must have been night, so power ran out. \r\n\r\nA year later and I'm back in the game. Nearly quit when I lose half the components I've made since I died and couldn't empty my backpack before the despawn timer ran out because of a bug that didn't let me swap between containers. Rage quit for the day then come back. I set up a planetary base in multiplayer and accidentally managed to detach my wind turbine because I couldn't tell which parts of my refinery were valid connection points. I only learned that when I went to respawn and found out that my base was unpowered, and everything thus nonfunctional. So I do the natural thing and spend ten minutes flying from my buddy's asteroid space to the planet and pull off a flawless landing within a hundred meters of my base, where I can diagnose the problem and immediately realize that I'm totally screwed. The wind turbine despawned, and I have no power, so I can't make the parts I need for the turbine, not even with scrapping part of my base. I have a solar panel on my rover, but it's night and I now have to wait 1 real life hour to be able to do ANYTHING. Sign off, and now I'll have to repeat the spaceflight to get back and try again. I've already died twice reattempting reentry and just hate the game and myself at this point.\r\n\r\nRage quit, then came back, thought I'd fix things. I only wait about 10 minutes this time for the sun to come over, get power back, fix my base. Great. Think I'll go for a short rover trip to try and find some resources to get off world. Go for the trip, isn't too bad till I take a turn a little too hard and flip my rover. My mistake, whatever. I'll just scrap the whole thing since my solar panel and battery are toast. Get halfway through before my inventory is full, so take a quick flight home. Go back, and of course the rest has despawned! Why wouldn't it. \r\n\r\nI'm done with this game. It's so unbelievably unfriendly to beginners, and I say that as a player of FtD.

It was also the most popular update so far. \nThe announcement of the sequel (SE2) shouldn't worry you as they plan continuing to support and update the SE1. \nThe modding scene is pretty fantastic and has been great at filling in on the PVE experience. The Steam workshop support is really nice as well making the sharing of builds and mods convenient.\n\nThe optional paid DLC are fun and I currently own all of them though they're not all necessary to get the full Space Engineers experience. There are videos on YouTube braking down and comparing all the DLCs and recommending which ones are worth the money. I highly suggest you check out Splitsie's video about them before purchasing any. \n\nOverall I rate it a 9/10 game. No other game has quite managed to scratch that sci-fi building/engineering itch for me.  \nI'm looking forward to the sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1735243260, "timestamp_updated": 1735243260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530418217182159424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183785275": {"recommendationid": "183785275", "author": {"steamid": "76561199571169135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3711, "last_played": 1735945422}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game, adictively good", "timestamp_created": 1735241127, "timestamp_updated": 1735241127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183782445": {"recommendationid": "183782445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375100913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14719, "last_played": 1735427684}, "language": "english", "review": "Automate, automate, automate\r\nMUST AUTOMATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSE 2 Hype is real", "timestamp_created": 1735239262, "timestamp_updated": 1735239262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183779931": {"recommendationid": "183779931", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014621013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16736, "last_played": 1730668272}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1735237522, "timestamp_updated": 1735237522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183776596": {"recommendationid": "183776596", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983323121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 25805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1009, "playtime_at_review": 24499, "last_played": 1737160942}, "language": "english", "review": "I appreciate the lack of oxygen!", "timestamp_created": 1735235334, "timestamp_updated": 1735235334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183774912": {"recommendationid": "183774912", "author": {"steamid": "76561199146132237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "playtime_at_review": 18999, "last_played": 1737059398}, "language": "english", "review": "IT GOOD GAME:)", "timestamp_created": 1735234297, "timestamp_updated": 1735234297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183773307": {"recommendationid": "183773307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887735549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "playtime_at_review": 9005, "last_played": 1737234910}, "language": "german", "review": "Good game.
