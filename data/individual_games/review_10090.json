I couldn't beat it even on Regular with the controls. It's amazing how much better I was when I tested it with a Controller+Mouse. I was playing a lot better and having more fun. \n\nRegardless, this was my first Call of Duty game in about 8 years. I enjoyed the campaign a lot, even if it was difficult to get through.  I had some bugs however while playing the game, where I had to repeat a level because it softlocked during a mission, but aside from that, it was clean throughout. I had the most fun playing as the Russian, and it was really cool putting up the flag at the end of the story.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's fun on the lower difficulties, but the grenades can be brutal. Don't expect to be able to beat this game on Veteran. I tried it one of the later levels, and there was a time where 7 grenade indicators were on my screen. \n\nZombies is fun as well, even if it is not the reason I bought the game. This game has a large amount of fan-made maps for COD Zombies, so if you are interested in that, you should probably give this one a go.\n\nI didn't play any of the multiplayer because it doesn't interest me. So I can't give an opinion on it.\n\nOverall, if you just want to shut your brain off and shoot some guns, this game is for you. Just don't pay full price for it.

liberating the Low Countries.But this is the greatest Call of Duty campaign to ever exist and of course we start in Stalingrad and play as Liutenant Reznov and from the Eastern Front we go all the way to Berlin,destoying and liberating.\n\n Besides the Russian campaign,Invasion of the Japanese Islands are fun.Mision \"Burn em out\" allways comes to my mind when i talk about this with friends.You're in the deep jungle and yeah you have equipment and supply but deadly Japanese code is unstoppable and you have to get through hell of Iwo Jima to survive.\n\n Overall,the gameplay didn't age very well

Ces histoires, bien que simples, sont percutantes et pleines d'\u00e9motion, avec des moments forts qui marquent le joueur.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Une immersion dans les environnements d\u00e9vast\u00e9s :\r\nLes environnements sont \u00e0 couper le souffle. Des jungles pacifiques aux ruines de Berlin, chaque carte respire l\u2019histoire de la guerre. Les d\u00e9tails sur le terrain de bataille, les explosions et la violence des combats rendent chaque mission palpitante.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Le mode Zombies :\r\nUn des ajouts les plus m\u00e9morables de World at War est l\u2019introduction du mode Zombies, qui deviendra un pilier de la franchise. Survivre \u00e0 des vagues infinies de morts-vivants dans un manoir est aussi fun que terrifiant, et le mode a rapidement gagn\u00e9 une base de fans fid\u00e8le.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Un gameplay solide et classique :\r\nLe gameplay de World at War reste fid\u00e8le aux standards de la franchise. Le syst\u00e8me de vis\u00e9e et de couverture est efficace, les combats sont fluides et l\u2019utilisation des v\u00e9hicules et des armes lourdes ajoute une dose suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019intensit\u00e9.\r\n\r\nLes Points Faibles :\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Un manque de vari\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les missions :\r\nSi l\u2019immersion et la tension sont au rendez-vous, certaines missions peuvent devenir r\u00e9p\u00e9titives, avec des objectifs similaires d\u2019une carte \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Cela nuit l\u00e9g\u00e8rement \u00e0 la diversit\u00e9 de l'exp\u00e9rience.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Des IA ennemies un peu pr\u00e9visibles :\r\nLes ennemis, bien que coriaces, ne sont pas toujours tr\u00e8s intelligents et peuvent devenir pr\u00e9visibles, ce qui rend certaines sections du jeu moins tendues.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Une campagne courte :\r\nLa campagne solo peut se terminer relativement rapidement, ce qui peut d\u00e9cevoir ceux qui attendent une exp\u00e9rience plus longue. Heureusement, le mode multijoueur et le mode Zombies offrent une belle dur\u00e9e de vie.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Des graphismes un peu dat\u00e9s :\r\nBien que les graphismes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionnants pour l'\u00e9poque, World at War commence \u00e0 montrer son \u00e2ge, notamment au niveau des textures et des animations des personnages. Toutefois, cela n'enl\u00e8ve rien \u00e0 l\u2019immersion.\r\n\r\nEn conclusion :\r\nCall of Duty: World at War reste un \u00e9pisode marquant de la saga, offrant une exp\u00e9rience immersive et brutale dans l\u2019une des p\u00e9riodes les plus tragiques de l\u2019histoire. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa campagne palpitante, son mode Zombies novateur et son multijoueur solide, il a su se faire une place de choix parmi les meilleurs titres de la franchise Call of Duty.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfae Verdict final :\r\nUn jeu incontournable pour les fans de Call of Duty et de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Si vous aimez les missions intenses, les zombies et les batailles \u00e9piques, ce jeu est pour vous.\r\n\r\n\u23f3 Temps de jeu recommand\u00e9 :\r\n\r\nCampagne principale : 6 \u00e0 8 heures.\r\nMultijoueur et Zombies : 20+ heures pour d\u00e9couvrir tout le contenu.\r\n\u2728 Note personnelle : Un jeu d\u2019action brut et excitant, avec une atmosph\u00e8re et un gameplay qui continuent de plaire aux joueurs, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s toutes ces ann\u00e9es. Si vous \u00eates fan de guerre moderne et d\u2019histoires percutantes, World at War vous emm\u00e8nera dans un tourbillon de batailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735862580, "timestamp_updated": 1735862580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184579412": {"recommendationid": "184579412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401205540", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3400, "last_played": 1734165714}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth it for zombies alone. classic maps and hundreds of community made maps and mods.", "timestamp_created": 1735861426, "timestamp_updated": 1735861426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184574508": {"recommendationid": "184574508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356270279", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 290, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1735860617}, "language": "english", "review": "this piece of shit does not open give me my fucking death cards back", "timestamp_created": 1735857112, "timestamp_updated": 1735857112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184573319": {"recommendationid": "184573319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247776160", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 228, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1735338080}, "language": "english", "review": "Call of Duty World at War\n\nCall of Duty: World at War is an outstanding entry in the Call of Duty series that delivers a gritty, immersive, and unforgettable World War II experience.

Recomendado \r\n\r\nCall of Duty: World at War no es solo un videojuego, es un referente en la historia de los shooters b\u00e9licos y, para m\u00ed, una experiencia personal inolvidable. Desde las primeras partidas en la PS3, este juego marc\u00f3 una etapa de mi vida en la que compart\u00ed intensos momentos con mi padre. En cada misi\u00f3n, en cada enfrentamiento, descubr\u00ed no solo una historia llena de tensi\u00f3n y hero\u00edsmo, sino tambi\u00e9n un v\u00ednculo especial que solo puede nacer a trav\u00e9s del compa\u00f1erismo en el campo de batalla virtual.\r\n\r\nCon el tiempo, el salto a Steam me permiti\u00f3 revivir esta obra maestra y explorar el incre\u00edble mundo de los custom maps en Zombies, donde conoc\u00ed a personas que compart\u00edan la misma pasi\u00f3n. Juntos enfrentamos desaf\u00edos que pusieron a prueba nuestra habilidad y estrategia, creando momentos que quedar\u00e1n grabados para siempre.\r\n\r\nPero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las an\u00e9cdotas personales, World at War destaca por uno de los personajes m\u00e1s memorables de toda la saga: Viktor Reznov. Su presencia imponente, su voz cargada de emoci\u00f3n y su inquebrantable determinaci\u00f3n lo convierten en una figura legendaria. Reznov no es solo un soldado, es un l\u00edder que inspira, un hombre que personifica el sacrificio y la lucha por la justicia en medio del caos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Cada interacci\u00f3n con \u00e9l, cada discurso, es un recordatorio de por qu\u00e9 este juego sigue siendo tan ic\u00f3nico.\r\n\r\nSi te gustan los juegos con una narrativa impactante, personajes inolvidables y acci\u00f3n intensa, Call of Duty: World at War es una experiencia que debes vivir. Es un t\u00edtulo que marc\u00f3 mi vida, y estoy seguro de que puede marcar la tuya tambi\u00e9n.

I didn't play the multiplayer but I keep coming back to the campaign every 2 years since it came out. You play as the Americans in Japan and as the Russians that take the battle from there homeland too the third reich. \r\n\r\nThis games has balls on how it depicts war. The Japanese just banzai your ass and you will never forget \"URAAA\", the cry of victory from the russians. The game really takes you to a gritty place, a place that you'll wish never to experience in real life. The game is full of little details and Reznov is just a beast. Take your time to let the game sink in and take your time while your playing, to look around. The missions are so cool and as the story progresses, the personalities and behaviour of the soldiers change also. They don't make them like this anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso back in the day when you finished the campaign for the first time and you unlocked the new zombie mode for the first time was just insane.

Much darker too.\r\n\r\nZombie Mode : Comes with the 4 OG maps that created the very begining of the Classic Zombie mode. Do I really need to say more ?\r\n\r\nMultiplayer :  If what you are looking for is the multiplayer.. unfortunately most of the lobbies are either empty or filled with bots and XP Glitches. Still there are some normal severs left but very few. I heard there's an alternative for the Multiplayer side with Plutonium, which would probably have more servers. But I was still able to enjoy it without Plutonium this very morning !\r\n\r\nPLUS: If you ever get bored there are plenty mods that you can download for the Zombies mode from community creators. Lots of custom maps to choose from on Nexus Mods.\r\n\r\nWith all this taken into consideration, it was still very worth it to me.

the first games I remember playing. Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare are stand outs in the series but, one Call of Duty game stands above them all and that's Call of Duty: World at War.\n\nCall of Duty: World at War is my favourite of the entire series, it's a horrific, haunting take on WW2 in a time where WW2 FPS games were massively oversaturated. The entire tone is excellent and the soundtrack is masterfully woven into the gameplay and atmosphere. World at War is about the chaos, wastage and death of the biggest war in human history while also still being a shooting gallery intended for entertainment. Everything about WaW is grim and I love it, its bloody, gory and pulls no punches. WaW is also just an incredibly entertaining game that has held up remarkably well, the graphics and animations have held up really well where as the crusty sound design has definitely aged a bit. The soundtrack however is still excellent, I cannot stress enough how epic yet haunting the soundtrack is, it just has so many layers to it and it fits into the gameplay perfectly.\n\nThe great thing about Call of Duty: World at War is that its easy to recommend because its easy to play and understand. You shoot stuff and it go boom. Sadly WaW is the only one we will ever get because they never made another like it, it is truly unique even to its own series. \n\n[i]As a side note this game is exceptionally difficult on Veteran, especially if you want to 100% it[/i]\nhttps://youtu.be/5Dta0rRvHow?si=y_ySe6wm4YKxD-C2\n\n[b]That CoD rant you've heard a million times before:[/b]\nCall of Duty nowadays is a complete joke. In my unpopular opinion the series nose dived with the release of Black Ops 1 and became a multiplayer focused joke, it steered away from big, epic simulated battles and went toward awful character driven 'special ops' gameplay that was heavily scripted. Call of Duty died a long time ago and started catering to the lowest common denominator, it is extremely depressing to me when somebody claims that Black Ops 1 was the 'good old days' of CoD campaigns. CoD and games in general nowadays have lost all their grit and historical accuracy (not that WaW is particularly accurate) which is why WaW is a gem from when the industry wasn't being coerced by people like Sweet Baby Inc and the HR department.", "timestamp_created": 1735312031, "timestamp_updated": 1735312427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183883297": {"recommendationid": "183883297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210284808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3045, "last_played": 1736098673}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1735311496, "timestamp_updated": 1735311496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183879168": {"recommendationid": "183879168", "author": {"steamid": "76561199401462555", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1735548440}, "language": "english", "review": "If I played this back when it was released, it would have undoubtedly blown me away. The first few hours are the most immersive - it is a very gritty, no-fluff kind of portrayal of war that I never experienced in other games. Instead of having a full arsenal of weapons and machinery, you are forced to conserve ammo and scavenge across the map to have a chance at survival. Your squad mates are dying left and right like it's a normal thing (granted, like 5 of them died because I shot them on accident), your enemy advances with undying fervor and in a seemingly infinite string of people, and you are forced to sit in a bleak environment of a jungle or a destroyed city, where every shade merges into each other, forming the gray mess of the environment. Even on the normal difficulty, the game is unforgiving: without proper positioning and precise shots, as well as quick thinking, you have no chance of advancing. The air filled with shouts of men, machine roars and whistle of bullets. It is beautiful in its grotesque-ness.\n\nI did not play this game in childhood, so rest assured that my opinion of it is not clouded with nostalgia. With that in mind, the game did not age too well. The difficulty here often stems from the fact that it is not very clear what to do: sometimes you have to eliminate a set number of enemies to progress, other times you need to advance to a different location to continue or the enemies will spawn infinitely. The gun play, albeit good, gets pretty stale after a while, with every gun being assigned to one of three classes: sniper rifle, smg or handgun (useless). Also, the game is relatively short: if you wanted to, you could complete it in 4-5 hours. And finally, I would have loved to see more story. The characters are memorable, but mainly 'cause what they say, not what they do. What they do is always the same: kill bad guys -> die -> win. \n\nAlthough I am not a fan of action shooters, I still enjoyed this.

It\u2019s gritty and brutal, but above all, it brings a level of epic scale that\u2019s hard to match. The Red Army\u2019s final push against Germany feels like a wave of raw vengeance\u2014just crashing forward again and again until there\u2019s nothing left. The campaign alternates with the last days of the Pacific theater, in battered islands and thick jungles where every inch of ground is drenched in the desperation of japanese defense to the death. Both fronts feel bleak and unyielding, yet completely different in atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI love how unstoppable you feel during these final assaults. Each firefight feels intense... whether it's in a hunt like in Stalingrad, a precise military operation as in the first pacific battles or an unstoppable glorious push, There\u2019s a weight behind everything you do that pulls you right into the conflict and the intended atmospheres which chain just right. The Stalingrad mission starting among the corpses with the motherland suffering from the german assault is a perfect prologue to the final assault. \r\n\r\nThe weapons in World at War feel fantastic, too. Strong\u2014mighty, even, which fits perfectly with the game\u2019s tone. From the M2 Flamethrower to the BAR, most of the arsenal feel super satisfying to use. The settings are also pretty rare for CoD and even overall for a shooter, covering everything from bleak pacific outposts, european countryside, trenches, a devastated Berlin to grim jungle warfare and bleak Pacific outposts. Usually, you\u2019d expect vibrant tropical islands, but here it\u2019s all scorched beaches and desperate defenses, with sunsets that feel more like it's a showdown than beautiful. The attention to historical detail is spot-on as well. For example, seeing Japanese soldiers with glasses late in the war nods to how everyone got mobilized in a last-ditch effort, even those previously excluded for poor eyesight aligned with the desperate \"BANZAIII charges\".\r\n\r\nReznov is a magnificent bastard who drives home the feeling of vengeance and victory at all costs as part of an unstoppable human wave. He gives you the desire to push for the win no matter the costs, with no quarters given.  \r\n\r\nWorld at War has aged like fine wine. Back when it came out, it was overshadowed by the brilliance of CoD 4: Modern Warfare, but looking back on it now\u2014especially compared to some of the latest releases\u2014it\u2019s easily one of the strongest campaigns in the series.\r\n\r\nThere are flaws though; the friendly AI can be unbelievably dumb at times, blocking you when you\u2019re trying to escape a grenade and causing you to die invevitably. There are also some terrain glitches, and the older engine can be a real headache. I have to run the game in safe mode and readjust the graphics every time I launch the game, because if I don\u2019t, it defaults to 600x800 resolution\u2014and in an already dated engine, that turns into an unplayable pixel mess.\r\n\r\nStill, even with those issues, World at War delivers one of the best campaign experiences CoD has to offer. It nails that perfect balance between feeling epic and mighty without going overboard. The storylines are grounded in real WWII battles\u2014no stupid scenarios with Russia invading Europe in one day or South America defeating US, no gimmicky mechanics either, nothing to break immersion\u2014something that\u2019s been missing in newer CoD titles. It captures the brutal glory of WWII victory, their land, their people, their blood!", "timestamp_created": 1735145940, "timestamp_updated": 1735145940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":
