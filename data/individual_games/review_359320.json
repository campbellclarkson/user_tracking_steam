[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis is one of my most played games (I have several hundred hours before it came to steam), with most of my time spent in the Horizons era well before Odyssey which is an expansion I have not, and will never buy.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot I could say about this game, both positive and negative, nevertheless, what I have always seen as the greatest positive is the incredible foundation upon which all else is built. A core pillar of that being the beautiful, futuristic yet functional UI.\r\n\r\nWhat compels me to make this review is my utter contempt for how unbelievably horrendous the new UI is in the current version of the game. It genuinely makes me angry every time I dock at a station and try and navigate the menus. The colours, the general layout, everything which has changed is just HIDEOUS. Not only is it godawful to look at, but it also makes it so, SO much harder to get immersed in the game like before.\r\n\r\nShowing this game to a newcomer, in the past, I'd take pride in guiding them through the beautiful menus, that excitement would now be replaced by shame and feeble attempt to explain that it wasn't always like this.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just a personal problem, but every time I come back to spend an hour or so bounty hunting I end up leaving with a visceral disgust. \r\n\r\nI struggle to put into words how much I hate it - I mean I struggle to comprehend how any rational or passionate developer could actually be proud of the changes - so I end my rant here.\r\n\r\nLet me end with this - the base game was so good to me that I would always be satisfied with it despite a complete lack of new content. That base game experience is now worsened to the point that I actively do not want to interact with it (yes that may seem extreme but the UI was a huge component for me), and thus I am here writing a negative review.\r\n\r\n*Maybe it's possible to access an older version of the game, I haven't looked into it. Regardless, I think a negative review talking about the current state of the game is still relevant.", "timestamp_created": 1737407003, "timestamp_updated": 1737407003, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542857170104980469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "186040388": {"recommendationid": "186040388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061346247", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1643, "playtime_at_review": 2682, "last_played": 1737414003}, "language": "english", "review": "great game and the expansion makes it even better. would love to see the ability to move around your ship in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1737404533, "timestamp_updated": 1737404533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "186039791": {"recommendationid": "186039791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113356150", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 24509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24509, "last_played": 1697732468}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1737403936, "timestamp_updated": 1737403936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "186039637": {"recommendationid": "186039637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097764164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 102922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1481, "playtime_at_review": 102771, "last_played": 1737412861}, "language": "english", "review": "o7", "timestamp_created": 1737403775, "timestamp_updated": 1737403775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "186039422": {"recommendationid": "186039422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061958569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4182, "playtime_at_review": 4626, "last_played": 1737413914}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O jogo te joga no espa\u00e7o sem tutorial nenhum, voce morre duzentas vezes at\u00e9 entender como pilota a nave, morre mais 200 tentando entender como funciona os bot\u00f5es, com isso vc aprendeu 1% do jogo em 40 horas de jogadas.\r\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1737403575, "timestamp_updated": 1737403575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "186037354": {"recommendationid": "186037354", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002872006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 343, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1737401467}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65e0\u4e2d\u6587\u592a\u786c\u6838\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u56fd\u4eba\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1737401512, "timestamp_updated": 1737401512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "186035654": {"recommendationid": "186035654", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975696885", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4964, "playtime_at_review": 6123, "last_played": 1737397119}, "language": "english", "review": "So I really want to love this game but I'm having difficulty even liking it at this point.  It really feels like this game is designed to beat the new players into submission instead of helping them learn and figure out the game.  So I've lost a ship due to minor mistakes, and now my friend that's trying to learn with me lost his ship and is thinking of not even returning at this point as when he died he couldn't afford to replace the ship and is now out 100 of thousands of credits for it and all that really happened was he got too close to a star which damaged a good portion of his ship as he fought to leave the star, which cost him his docking and super cruise computers, which as a newer player still figuring out the game are basically vital and honestly should be built into every single ship.  Making new players equip these into optional slots with limited slots to begin with is only FURTHER causing new players even greater frustration and honestly is a hinderance to the system as a whole.  So without his docking computer or super cruise he actually made it to his destination hundreds of light years away but during docking bump the metal bars of the space station, which auto cancelled his docking request, gave him fines for blocking the entry way then eventually got attacked and destroyed by the station itself all while just trying to figure out how to land without a docking computer in his type 9 heavy.  and he was down to only 3 million credits after buying his type 9 and can't afford to replace it and has basically rage quit the game at this point which i understand and same thing happened to me while learning.  I lost a complete anaconda with upgrades for the same reason of not enough money to replace it setting me back 300 million Ish total for the loss of that ship and simply because I was exploring signal sources and ended up in a bad one where i got gang attacked in causing my death and loss of new upgraded ship.    On top of that to even try to the tutorial I've had 3 friends quit cause the tutorial was too hard for them to get through.  My father being one of them.  Are the devs just really this destined to make the game so hard for new players that they get no new players?  Then on top of all that even if you get the system of flying around there little nuisance on top of that.  Example i want to mine, means i have to have a drill, refinery, storage, collector limpets, prospector limpets, and to have limpets, but nothing teaches you all this so it's literally go out go back go out go back it figure it out in game or watching extensive videos outside of game to even understand the game.  And even when you get to understanding the game you still have to look stuff up nonstop for trade routes and destinations etc. on external websites.

It HAS Open world mode where you CAN see other players. However, everyone pretty much plays in Solo mode so it kinda makes me question why Open is even a thing. And you'll likely never see another player anyway because they mostly hang out in a handful of areas. You really get the sense of loneliness with the game.\n\nOh yeah, the grind. Probably the most busted and boring thing in the game. You spend more time collecting materials and flying to the Engineers to upgrade your stuff than actually doing what makes you happy in this game. Kinda killed the mood for me.

Is insane. This game is the sequel to Frontier Elite 2 which is the sequel to 1984s elite. In good Elite tradition this game is massive. And it is a good game. \n\nThe game has very little handholding (get a docking module on your ships until you are comfortable manual docking) and you need to spend time with it get to know it. But the rewards are massive if you spend the time.\n\nOut of the gate, you have the best space combat and best space exploration in any game. Planetary exploration is not as good as NMS but The space combat puts NMS in a corner. The game uses procedural generation and it works better than in NMS IMHO. It is a game that makes you go \"how the hell have I been playing for four hours?\" Over and over again. Either you are killing \"just one more pirate\" or exploring \"just one more system\" or mining \"just one more node\". It is really, really good.\n\nMining is fantastic as well. You have two types of mining laser mining and core mining. Laser mining is more profitable and pretty good but core mining is just *chef's kiss*. It is phenomenal. You can just play some tunes and relax while your charges blow asteroids open like cantaloupes. Seriously, it is not that complicated once you get used to it and it is fantastic.\n\nThe game is player driven and the devs have been more active in generating events. It is really fun. There are player communities with ads in game (fuel rats) that make the emerging narrative and the meta game outstanding. I wouldn't say better than Helldivers 2 but close and with far more potencial.\n\n\nNow the downsides:\nYou need certain third party websites and tools to really play this game. The devs have improved trading somewhat and you can make a profit using the in game systems (that really could use more explanation) but third part websites make it... Easier and even simple things like calculating the profit of your possible trade based on cargo hold capacity, could and should be offered in game as well as certain elements of exo biology could do with a brushup maybe in exchange for lower rewards. It is fun to log and analyze a new type of bacteria in an alien world. It is not fun to hunt for white bacteria in a white icy planet for hours.\n\nAgain, you can have fun without these extraneous for quite a while or forever and I recommend going as blind as possible and use your in game codex. but you will reach a point where you will be at a bit of a loss. And that is something that should be fixed.\n\nThe game needs more dev based events. They are awesome and make for very good gameplay. Something like a game master like Helldivers 2 would be cool.\n\nWalkable ship interiors. Even if you do nothing. It is such an easy win that I struggle to understand why we don't have those.\n\nGraphics are good... But the aliasing methods are not well implemented. The amount of shimmering artifacts can be distracting especially if on foot in a settlement.\n\nFoot combat... Is there. It exists. Serves it's purpose. But it is a far cry from the ship combat. I would love to see it improved.\n\n\nOverall, I love this complex game. It scratches an itch that No Man's Sky never did for me. It is definitely worth it putting up the time and frustration.\n\nAnd as an explorer who is currently over 1k light years away from the bubble, I hope I will never see any of you!

From the moment players begin their journey, they are thrust into a meticulously crafted universe where the possibilities seem endless.\r\nOne of the game's strongest points is its attention to detail. The graphics are stunning, capturing the vastness and beauty of space. Planetary landings, space stations, and star ships are intricately designed, offering a visually spectacular experience. Sound design is equally impressive, with ambient sounds and a dynamic soundtrack that enhances the immersion.\r\nGameplay in Elite Dangerous is diverse and complex, including trading, mining, exploration, combat, and more. The game's open-ended nature allows players to carve their own paths, fostering a sense of freedom and adventure. However, this complexity can also be a drawback for some. The learning curve is steep, and new players might find the initial stages daunting. A comprehensive tutorial and community resources help alleviate this, but it\u2019s still a game that demands patience and dedication.\r\nOverall, Elite Dangerous is a remarkable game that offers depth and realism in space exploration.

I stopped playing it because the overall game design seemed interesting but felt monotonous. The Gameplay and combat felt dull. The progression seemed plodding for little to no overall reward or satisfaction vs the time spent in the game. In short, a lot of time spent to gain very little while the adventure being boring and uninteresting.\n\nWhen i played again all these years later, i was excited to start out on an actual planet and do \"things\" such as fighting, stealing, hacking, researching, etc. It gave an element of fun and interest to the game that i felt was needed. However after playing for about 16 hours i felt that this was the only thing that was really added to make the overall monotonous gameplay, dull combat, and plodding progression seem worth my time. The game is still a snail paced universe of nothing. I Play a lot of grinding, exploration, and complex fantasy based games but i just could not enjoy my time in this game. I was quick to realize this game is just not for me, mostly because i value my time.\n\nI would recommend this game if you really, really, really do not care about your personal time at all and can see your self spending hours roleplaying in a realistic space simulator as commander \"x\" doing \"whatever\" as this is a sandbox space simulator and it does good at being that.  i really enjoy these types of games and i STILL was falling asleep playing this game going from point a to b due to how travel is. There is a lot of frustration that can stem from that which is agitated from ganks of pirate npcs or players alike as well as ignorance that can lead your 10 hour irl travel time to complete waste. \n\nfor example if you are transporting resources to make money, and you take a far distance package due to you having a large max capacity for storage, then get ganked by pirates you can lose everything. in my instance, this happened but i was able to defeat the pirate. however my things were floating nearby and i had no idea how to get them back. i figured that out and was on my way. i can't imagine the frustration of other new players who ended up on the ass end of that experience though. even with auto pilot and things, the travel is really not fun and takes a lot of setup to make it feel better from default as well as a large learning curve.

The game has many missing or incomplete features. Many bugs that are present since 2019-2020. Not all of them can stop you from playing, or enjoying though. \n\nDespite the bugs/glitches, the game is basically a space-simulation. They made it as realistic as possible. It also has a lore with aliens and stuff. Has secrets which anyone can unfold. However, the Galaxy is huge, so the chance of unfolding those secrets is quite low. The game has different styles and mechanics. Exploration, Trading, Combat, On-foot missions, \"Powerplay\" (which includes the other 4). You are free to chose which gameplay you wish to play at any time. \n\nNow, the most important negative part of the game for me is that, you need third-party apps or websites, to enjoy the game. Without them, the game  is too shallow. Not enough information is given in-game by the developers. The most helpful/necessary one is the website called \"Inara.cz\". Without this website, the game would be lost in my opinion. Then there is the Elite Dangerous Market Connecter (EDMC). \n\nThe game is time consuming really. You can't do much if you're only going to play 1-2 hours per day. You have to really commit, in order to earn money, or enjoy the mechanics. \n\nBesides the \"cons\", the game is quite fun once you get used to it. However, this game isn't new-comer-friendly. It has been 10 years or so since the launch, but the devs aren't friendly either :)\n\nOnce you get used to the game, combat is quite good. You can either play \"Solo\", without seeing any other players, and fighting against NPCs, or you can play in a \"Private Group\" with friends. You can play in Open Play. with anyone. However, it is dangerous :) Players are really good fighters, even with a small ship, they can destroy your most huge/efficient/strong ship :)\n\n- You can also join different private groups to play with friendly strangers. \n\nTrading is the most boring one in my opinion. However, it is a good break from the other mechanics. You can just chill and trade stuff to earn money, or relations with different political powers/factions.\n\nNow, Exploration, this part of the game is the most fun. It is an alone type of mechanic, however, it's really amazing. You can always find systems which haven't been discovered yet. And your name will appear on the System Map as the one discovered it. You can map planets, drop down, and scan plants and stuff. And once you return to the Bubble (where everyone is grouped), you can sell this exploration data (biological scans, planet scans, system scans). \n\nI can't get into Powerplay as it's too complex and detailed. There are political figures (NPCs) whom you never see, only hear about. You can pledge to them, and do missions for them. Different features (bonusses or weapons, shield) are unlocked after you level up your rank with them. This mechanic still needs a rework though (Yes, I mean the PP 2.0). \n\nIf you have enough time, and love space and science, this is a good game. However, don't expect \"fixes, major lore updates\" frequently. I believe this is due to how the devs look at their own game, and the game engine they use --> It doesn't allow everything they dreamed of.", "timestamp_created": 1737028212, "timestamp_updated":

"review": "Amazing idea of a game, poorly executed and no where near beginner friendly and quite frankly it's BORING. If you have a lot of time to kill you might like this game but 90% of the gameplay was traveling and 10% of it was actually getting to do something fun. Anyone that actually has to work for living will barely be able to make any progress in this game. Had to restart my first play through because I took a cargo mission got some of the cargo and didn't realize I didn't have enough cargo space. I figured hell it'll be fun to do the trips so I'll make 2. Then I saw the quest mentioned I wouldn't get credit if I didn't have the full cargo. So I abandoned the quest. The game didn't warn me that I would be charged for having the cargo in my ship and it put me in debt...with nothing else to my name...can't buy fuel or anything. Could I return the cargo and get rid of the penalty? No. Completely restarted and deleted my save. Finally got to some space combat(the whole reason I got into this game) got about 120k worth of bounties the game said I could claim. I would say the space combat was fun if it wasn't just time spent scanning a bunch of signals trying to find your target and then finally flying to your target following him like a dog chasing it's tail and holding down the pew pew button and pointing in his general direction until he went boom quite mindless. Flying and searching for the target took over twice as long as the actual combat... Spent about an hour trying to find a system using google and inara to find a station to turn in my bounties but could not for the life me turn these in. Although it was in my transactions no station would recognize them. Fine I went to another system to see if I could buy a new ship....turns out docking at another station takes your permit away for the beginner area which isn't really explained that well so I lost access to the beginner area even though I didn't accomplish much and again no warning before docking that this would happen. This station did not have a shipyard..ok finally find a station with a shipyard and make 3 more jumps. Made the trip and low and behold \"docking permissions denied\" with no mention of that on the star map before I made the 3 jumps to get there. And don't get me started on overshooting your targets when you're super-cruising EVERYTIME. That was my sign that the game isn't for me.\n\nHuge time sink and absolutely nothing to show for it. Yes I tried youtube videos and tutorials but once you actually play the game it's not like what you see with the magic of video editing. If you enjoy activites such as watching paint dry or admiring grass grow then you've found the game for you. The ship flight and combat were not even interesting and that's the main reason I got the game. The immersion could be there if I didn't have to alt-tab every few minutes to one of the many tabs you need to keep open to search up things for the game. At least 5 of these play hours was just me afk googling and trying to figure out what I'm doing. The only thing dangerous about this game is the amount of type spent trying to figure out what you're doing outside of the bare bones tutorial and the only thing elite is the amount of time spent traveling between missions. Don't let my 20 hours fool you I probably got 3 hours of actual gameplay once you factor in the searching for answers outside of the game and traveling.", "timestamp_created": 1737000270, "timestamp_updated": 1737000465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501902580261230469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185687032": {"recommendationid": "185687032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290064398", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 38915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38915, "last_played": 1661630367}, "language": "english", "review": "If \"Space trucking simulator\" sounds up your alley, buy this.

It's literally life-changing in VR- just sitting in the cockpit of a small ship... not even flying it, just SITTING in it in the hanger.  \n\nAbout 40 ships you can buy, endless combinations of ship parts before you get into the RPG-side of leveling up your gear.  \nMining can be fun and relaxing.  Laser mine or maybe use bombs to blow asteroids in half.  Many options there.\nCombat, either vs humans or.... others.... packs a punch and there is a lot of depth to be had there.\nTrade reacts to market and plot forces.  \nFinding a cool-looking thing out in space and being able to fly to it and check it out is awesome.  I've checked out constellations, black holes, nebulae, etc.  And by bringing some good research/scanning gear I've made good money doing so.\nThere are \"community\" goals where the players either work for or against certain in-game tasks that have real consequences.  Example-  One such task was to help bring supplies to make a string of space stations leading from the human-occupied \"Bubble\" to the center of the galaxy, \"Colonia\".  That sucker got done in RECORD time- the community was absolutely STARVING for a way to get to the juicy nougat center of the galaxy and as a result it was finished in record time.  There have been other times where different player groups DIDN'T want a community goal to work- and so for a week there was a constant battle over that supply line.\n\nThis game will take you an hour or three to get comfortable with how things work- but I wouldn't worry about that.  I'd mess around in super-cheap ships early on until you can takeoff/land reliably, don't even THINK about combat for a while, and just see if the whole overall flow of the game suits you.  Yeah, there is deep ship customization, combat, a faction system, the ability to custom-engineer just about everything, an entire FPS-part that I have not even started yet.... but you'll have plenty of time for all that.  I have about 1700 hours.  I'm missing 1/2 of the ships, my total worth doesn't add up to the cost of one of those Fleet Carriers..... just know there is a LOT of game here.\n\nOh- super-tip:  Be prepared to rebind the keys for \"Fly Straight Up, Straight Down, Left, Right, Forward, Backwards, and turning your nose left and right\" to keys you'd be comfortable using in a first-person shooter.... or just something along those lines.  There are a lot of times you'll want to move in any given direction but have your actual THROTTLE at ZERO, so basically if you let go of all the keys you'd come to a full stop.", "timestamp_created": 1736944287, "timestamp_updated": 1736944287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185635313": {"recommendationid": "185635313", "author": {"steamid": "76561199804949652", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1736934967}, "language": "english", "review": "can't play social can't connect to frontier servers. ridiculous. not willing to invest loads of time trying to figure out a solution", "timestamp_created": 1736934804, "timestamp_updated": 1736934804, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185630540": {"recommendationid": "185630540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071501309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1736089439}, "language": "dutch", "review": "The controls are discusting.

It was here that I made the mistake of moving a couple of inches forward during a security check after thinking that my scan was all done and dusted, but................. yeah, of course it wasn't!! \n\n\"Don't you dare!\" screeched the guard, as the moaning cow, and her fellow imbeciles proceeded to introduce several holes into my character's much surprised carcass, and before I could so much as shout \"Get f**ked\", the screen went blank, I hit 'Continue', and awoke in a jail cell after paying a fine!  \n\nOriginally undeterred by this, despite being informed that I'd failed the mission, I left the cell, which I stupidly assumed was on the same sh*tty rock as my earlier demise, and hopped into my ship to pick up a different item from where I thought would be pretty close by. Well how f**king wrong I was!! After maybe six consecutive hyperspace jumps, I decided to re-check the galaxy map, whereupon I came to a startling realisation - that the jail cell was in fact about 10 billion light centuries away from where I'd been shot, and I only had 25% of my fuel left!  No big deal I thought, as I noticed that I was slap f**king bang in front of a 'fuel star' How hard can it be to scoop some free fuel? was what I figured as I pulled to a stop near my glowing would-be saviour, and stepped into the porch** for a quick cigarette, and a glass of water. \n\n** I don't mean to f**k up any kind of story immersion, but I'm talking about the porch out back of our house - I haven't managed so far at least, to build one on the side of my ship!! :D It is after all, just one of those crappy Sidewinders that ya get for free after doing the flight tutorial at the game's beginning, and was all I could afford, being devoid of any of those Arx things - and thus poorer than a church mouse, whose parents had suddenly emigrated, and taken all of the Edam with them just to rub it in further! ** \n\nAs I came back from the porch, I heard a beeping sound, which alerted me to the discovery that my ship had almost melted, and as if that wasn't enough to p*ss on my chips, I hadn't even scooped any fuel whatsoever, because I didn't actually have a fuel scoop fitted anyway, (I thought they just came as standard, like spare wheels with new cars!) and the fuel that I did have pre-porch break had run out too! I thought just for a moment that Sh*t Creek had possibly dried up, when a new alarm notification in blue announced that my oxygen supply was about to kick me in the nads too, so I had 5 minutes to un-f**k myself, or I'd be toast! \n\nSuffice to say, that if it wasn't for Google, and the two angelic individuals sent from the 'Fuel Rats' website, my ship would still be there, along with the two raised middle finger bones of my commander's skeletal remains! :D \n\nSecondly, tonight I had landed on the surface of another barren, dusty backwater, to try and retrieve something from a crashed ship :) I had just disembarked, and was for the first time in that moon buggy thing that I forgot I had from the beginning. Not having learned anything at all from taking porch breaks, I pressed Esc to pause the game, to check on tonight's tea in the oven, which incidentally was ribs in soy sauce :D\n\nWell the ribs were doing just fine, but my screen on the other hand, had gone dark - apart from this message: \n\nYOUR SHIP HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY SH*T-FACE DAVENPORT\n\nYeah ok, I can't remember his actual first name, so I elaborated slightly - but he's still a pr*ck, I promise!! :D The 'Incident Report' gave the reason of this outrage as PIRACY!!! Maybe they found out about me recording albums onto cassette tapes when I was a kid!? Who knows?? \n\nI thought that this Davenport bell end must be another human player at first - some griefer type w*nker like those that I would once hunt down to the ends of the Earth in Red Dead Online until they cried, or quit the session :D, but then I remembered that I had been playing Solo this time around! :-o \n\nSo maybe all of the NPCs in this game, not just those at stations, installations etc individually have actual names!!? \n\nI haven't been back on the game since this latest moronic foray of interstellar ignorance, not least because according to the main menu now, my commander is dead!!

That was it for me\u2026 until two weeks ago. I decided to give it another shot after seeing some of the recent (Odyssey) updates, and holy crap, this game is unmatched. I feel so damn sorry for missing the Thargoid Wars and ignoring this masterpiece for four years.\n\nI\u2019ve tried Starfield (no thanks, Howard), X4 (too old), No Man\u2019s Sky (fun for a while, but 60+ hours in, it just gets repetitive), and even Star Citizen (30 FPS on a 4070 S Ti for a couple of planets and a not-even-half-finished game? Yeah, no). None of these games even come close to what Elite offers.\n\nThis is a mind-blowing space sim that gives you the entire freaking Milky Way, modeled with real astronomical data. We\u2019re talking billions of star systems, actual planet landings (yes, you can land on planets with the Odyssey update), and iconic destinations like Sagittarius A* and the Solar System. The graphics? Stunning. The ship mechanics? Deep and immersive. The lore? Rich and layered. And don\u2019t even get me started on the dogfights\u2014space combat in this game is on a whole other level.\n\nThere\u2019s something for everyone: different missions at every station and hub, different playstyles for exploration, bounty hunting, mining, trading and more. Into galactic politics? Powerplay adds lore-driven action gameplay. Want to land on a planet, hop in your planetary vehicle, and roam around? You got that too. Prefer managing your ship\u2019s power in the heat of a dogfight to outmaneuver your enemies? Yep, it\u2019s all there. Feel like grabbing a gun and fighting on foot? Absolutely. and it's an MMO.\n\nI could go on and on about everything you can do, but honestly, the best part is discovering it yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out and using a keyboard and mouse, trust me on this: swap roll and yaw controls. Put roll on the keyboard (A and D) and yaw on the mouse\u2014it makes flying so much easier. If you\u2019re unsure how to do it, Google it, or add me and I\u2019ll help you. Also, do yourself another favor and search \u2018what is Elite rebuy?\u2019\u2014it will save you and your ship :)\n\nAnd also don\u2019t forget to check out the EliteDangerous subreddit\u2014seriously, the community there is super welcoming and helpful with literally anything you need.\n\nHonestly, if space sims had their own 'souls-like' category, the standard would be called elite-like.

There is an ongoing story and it is affected by players, but it's more a community thing, where every player's activities contribute to a 'Background Simulation'. \nThere are things to unlock, Medals to earn but finding them may prove a little tricky without outside help. \nOn that note I find my time in game is heavily dependant on External websites like inara.cz, while incredibly useful, they're almost too good, as they show far more detail about the galaxy than you can generally find in game.\nI absolutely love this game, my Steam record says 695 Hours, that's in the last 2 months. And that doesn't include the 44 days on Xbox, probably over the last 8 years or so.\nI will always recommend it, but there are, unfortunately, always a lot of caveats.", "timestamp_created": 1736863857, "timestamp_updated": 1736863857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185577979": {"recommendationid": "185577979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851783595", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 95147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95147, "last_played": 1718387467}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich finde es nicht richtig das man sich mit echtem Geld voll ausgestattete Schiffe kaufen kann.", "timestamp_created": 1736863422, "timestamp_updated": 1736863422, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827164173126221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185571719": {"recommendationid": "185571719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120817397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6673, "last_played": 1732747485}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, I've only played this solo, or with friends on a private server.

Lets start somewhere simple, what does the game feel like? To me, it felt like space trucker sim. But that's not all there is to this game, its also at times an idle game in a way, due to waiting for a time to travel from one place to another. I have heard that the game has a pvp scene, never touched it, would rather play \"singleplayer\" as it can be called and face the ai.\r\n\r\nThe first time I got interdicted outside the tutorial, I was not ready, Being put into a combat situation was jarring, hard, and overwhelming in some ways, that said, I was not piloting a ship made for combat, and the game has that as a potential.\r\n\r\nCombat, can be a fast paced thing, with the right ship and the right custom equipment on the ship, you can face down anything you want within reason and within your own skill level, because skill is not optional for fights, its a must.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I played this game as a mining ship, I played this game as a goods transport ship, I played this game as a space bus-man, and I have had friends who enjoyed the combat. This is a good game, if you have the patience. If your attention span is not enough to last through this comment, this may not be the game for you, but give it a go anyways! See if it is your cup of tea.\r\n\r\nOh, Little side note at the end of this, I played this game and all 115 hours (as of the time of this review) On an absolute potato of a computer with shit ram and a shitty graphics card. Take the minimum requirements with a grain of salt, you might be able to play them with something as good as a desktop made for windows xp running modern windows with only 6 gigs of ram (two gigs of it not the same brand) and an old amd graphics card from 2011 with 4 gigs of vram and a single core intel processor running a whopping 2.1ghz speed (wow, so awesome) So if your computer is better than that, even slightly, give this a go (especially if you see it on sale)", "timestamp_created": 1736762812, "timestamp_updated": 1736762812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185501177": {"recommendationid": "185501177", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961159510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1935, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1737305765}, "language": "english", "review": "Keeps losing saved controls so it's unplayable on every restart, frustratingly laggy UI since it has to server-query a lot of things, insanely tedious progression to blatantly incentivize whaling with macrotransactions in a non-f2p game with an obnoxious shop getting shoved in your face, also even when playing solo it needs to always be online, preventing all modding or significant client customization.\n\nVR is kind of impressive for a little while, but sadly the entire structural rest of the game smothers the experience brutally.

You can travel and discover new things all the time! But that's not even the best part of this game! You can choose to do whatever and be whatever you want! The only downside is there's content lacking in regards of doing the same things over and over again which causes a competitive and boring outcome. There's not enough to do as in some sense why can we only do missions, raid, etc. Why is there no other money making methods? As well, why is there so little ships to buy and allot more cosmetics/etc. I'm not going to say this is perfect, but it's a much better alternative compared to Star Citizen, because it's not that demanding and my PC can run it.\n\nRecommend at least playing it for a few hours and set your own goals and how your going to get there, that's what makes this game addictive.\n\nNext for the devs, I recommend adding more content especially for single player mode, such as racing in space or on a planet, I would add stealth combat mechanics and more weapon options. Add the ability to research new alien technology, discover biomes, ancient alien civilizations and even the ability to take over planets, systems, create your own army whether legal or not, add more land vehicle options, and better character customization's. Maybe add the ability to choose a career path you want to go on, or create your own. Planets are to bland and could add some sort obstacles or different weather mechanics to liven up the systems. There's only human NPC's could be effective to add different races, lifeforms, and colonies. I know this sounds life X4 or Spacebourne 2 but the game feels really bland and old school and needs to catch up on what players really want! Not only that you'll beat Star Citizen at there own game.\n\nBut who knows that could be asking for allot or to little. But still I play this game whenever I can. I just want a game like Star Citizen, SpaceBourne 2, and X4 Foundation in one game setting. I tried Quanga but it's shooting for something different and not suitable for my taste. But Elite Dangerous is dangerously close to the dream game of a lifetime!\n\nJust 1 step at a time!", "timestamp_created": 1736750644, "timestamp_updated": 1736750644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185494378": {"recommendationid": "185494378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346678515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1736507204}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.", "timestamp_created": 1736748853, "timestamp_updated": 1736748853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448574692010879517", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185486961": {"recommendationid": "185486961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212483735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5415, "playtime_at_review": 2936, "last_played": 1737264486}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always wanted to give this game a try since its release but I never had the setup to play it, I only got it recently for a pretty big discount and I gotta say this game really makes my jaw drop every time I learn something new.\n\nMy experience as a new player learning the curves is definitely something that needed patience, interest, and curiosity. At first I thought just learning how to do the on-foot, flight, and mining tutorial would be the end of it but afterwards you see all these menu that you really don't know how to navigate through. Fortunately, I have played a lot of RPG games so I was prepared for this. Then you don't really know where to start, like what to do first? I click this and that until I figure out how to accept missions, oh I also didn't know where to go in the station, there was no arrows, no objective markers, just straight up following the signs on the stations.\n\nTo get myself to know the basics, it didn't really require me to do any research at all, it was really just me curiously using the terminal to access the mission board, talking to the guy in Inter Astra to unlock my Sidewinder, and do some missions. Now this is where things became a whole more interesting, I was definitely eager to go on combat and shoot stuff up but I felt that could ruin my enjoyment and the learning process, could've made me give up on trying the game and just refund it but I was reasonable, realistically if you were a new guy being tasked with the freedom of choosing jobs then obviously I picked the safest route which was transporting and delivery. It was mundane for sure, you just go from point A to point B but for some reason I felt immersed and relaxed just scouring through space and landing on planets it felt like therapy for me after playing intensive games that are just fast-paced of kill or be killed. The payment I got for doing those jobs were also rewarding, like getting your first pay in your first job and at the time I also thought the money was plenty.\n\nSo I started exploring the catalog of existing ships and that's when I started researching through online means, how do you get these ships? Why are some of them grayed out even though I have the money? Why this, why that. Then I found it, the website that provides a tool for us to use, you can use it to find the ships you want, the components you want, just through a couple of clicks, tells you which system is the closest from you to get those items. The website I'm referring to was INARA, it was almost like a bible that you need to pocket at all times because you're not getting anywhere without it.\n\nThen I set my goal for this game, it was to be a Mercenary after researching on what kind of careers you can pick up in this game. Though of course, being a merc with a starter ship like Sidewinder would be like jumping into a Rank S Quest with just a knife in your hand so I set my sights on the Krait Mk II, it fit with my taste of aesthetics and I heard it was one of the best ships you can get. So I continued my job as a delivery man. Also I'd like to add it was also confusing because when I was doing deliveries, I had to roam around where to give and where to get the objectives of my delivery though again in the end with some curiosity I was able to figure it out thanks to the terminals.\n\nOk so I did back and forth doing some deliveries, then I thought is there a better or a more efficient way to make fortune? Because this can take months. That's when I started to get deeper on my research, finding videos and guides. I found out that being an Exobiologist could earn you a lot of money so I tried it out, it was confusing at first with all the scanning the planet thing and the outfitting of the ship you gotta have so you can go as far as possible from the starting system, but with some patience I was able to figure it out and landed on a planet that was almost devoid of life but my scanners said there might some life here so I searched. Found my first scan, drove a couple hundred meters with my SRV, found another one, scan, until I found the 3rd one that was when it was complete.\n\nAfter that, I went back to a station that has something called the Vista Genomics using INARA as my guide. I was able to sell all my scanned stuff and holy it made my jaw drop, the potential money I can make through this so I thought I can probably get my Krait Mk II soon. So I continued as an exobiologist.\n\n40 hours later and here we are, Krait Mk II. This wouldn't have happened if I was playing games like War Thunder. The ship was beautiful, I thought it was an impossible dream but then I looked up online again. This was not a good course to take, why? Because I was limited in experience and knowledge and rushing it like this could end up badly, but this time I was bold so I tried to find Threat 0 Combat Missions. I flew the ship and found my target, went to combat and it was very satisfying getting my first ship kill (unlike previously when I went to Conflict Zones to gather money for my exobiologist expedition to upgrade my Hauler where I sort of steal kills from friendly NPCs and reap the reward) even though the money reward was on the smaller side but I knew this was it, soon I can be a proper Merc.\n\nSo now I'm still learning, there's builds I want to get for my Krait Mk II to make it even more formidable in combat but I will need money, materials, and other things so I'll just enjoy my time in Elite Dangerous.\n\nOk I ended up telling my playthrough for this review, in the end I think if you're looking for something \"realism and immersion\" in an affordable space sim this could be a game for you. I played No Man's Sky before, even though I think the game is well made it didn't click with me maybe it didn't fit my taste of aesthetics and as for games like Star Citizen I just think Elite Dangerous is more friendly towards your hardware and money. Though there are micro-transactions in this game, I was surprised that you can get the premium currency just by doing activities and could earn you up to 400 (cap) per week, not many games does that and the pricing of the premium currency well I thought it was still on the more affordable side than most premium battle passes this days but again if it can be cheaper then the better so I hope FD won't become greedy and improve upon this or at least just stay on course for people like me who's a bit on the more limited side of budget.\n\nOverall I think this game does cater to specific people, some people who's more fast-paced driven shouldn't get this game. I don't think the game is very time consuming that you have to play like a no-lifer, manage your time well and you can still complete a lot of things here. Again I cannot stress this enough but it does require you to have patience, interest, and curiosity in order to enjoy this game and maybe a little bit of appreciation to enjoy the vast empty space yet beautiful view.\n\nThanks for reading my review.", "timestamp_created": 1736737294, "timestamp_updated": 1736737294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185485185": {"recommendationid": "185485185", "author": {"steamid": "76561199152337749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4607, "playtime_at_review": 4037, "last_played": 1737301071}, "language": "english", "review": "Fighters are op", "timestamp_created": 1736734862, "timestamp_updated": 1736734862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185479359": {"recommendationid": "185479359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041479415", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 299, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1736728039}, "language": "english", "review": "wtf is this game. did first 2 little tutorials then wondered round space for 4 hours lost with no help. doesn't tell u u have to slow down b4 leaving hyperspace speed so zoomed past wrong targets, u put a marker which is hard to do then u cant see them. it auto undocks from starports so i waited for a 3 min countdown thinking wtf, then i got a fine for trespassing, wont let me pay fine so cant do any missions...", "timestamp_created": 1736727083, "timestamp_updated": 1736727083, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445478290319442749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185476940": {"recommendationid": "185476940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107170680", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1775, "playtime_at_review": 1939, "last_played": 1736726165}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich wird ja das Game eine Chance geben, nur diese st\u00e4ndige raus holen aus dem Sprung, Gegner hinter dir und bist in 2-3 sek tot.

Elite Dangerous. If you buy this game, you will get the chance to fly a space craft that can allow to explore a One-to-One representation of our beautiful home galaxy, The Milky Way Galaxy. You will be able to view the absolute beauty of our galaxy, in game. Not only will you be able to explore, but also get into \"space combat\" as a pirate, bounty hunter, or take sides in power play and fight in hot zones where you go against capital class ships. You can also be a space trucker and transport goods across the many stars of the galaxy. And you can also be a space miner and collect space rocks to sell. And if you have VR, the game becomes one of the best VR game available.\n\nHere is the problem with the game. The vastness of space in this game is very empty. There is absolutely no story telling like a Bethesda game where you have an NPC tell you that the solar system that you are in is a complete dump or filled with rich traders. This very much a player goal oriented game and not a story game which this game would excel at if the devs pushed a story. Ok so the game has player goals right? Yes it does. it consist of you grinding for credits to buy new ships and obtaining engineering materials to upgrade those ships which could take hours of you booting the game on and off to obtain the materials. Never in the history of gaming have I ever had to turn my game On and then OFF to grind for materials for upgrades. It's an absolute joke in terms of game design. Another problem with the game to enhance the grind experience is having the need to install or use third party sources to obtain information needed to make the experience of grinding easier. Players of this game have been begging the devs to implement these third party software/websites into the game to help players advance their space journey but the devs are adamant to not bring these tools into the game. The game also lacks ship interiors. You will only be stuck in the cock pit and will be unable to walk around and explore your ship that you paid credits for. Something that this games competitor (Star Citizen) offers generously. \n\nWith all that said. The game is still worth playing simply for what the game actually is. A One-to-One space exploration game of our own galaxy. There is no other games like this outside of star citizen. The sound effects of this game is absolutely flawless. Space combat is fun and an absolute dream in VR. Parking your ship in a star port manually for the first time is probably one of the best feelings ever! The good in this game out ways the bad. My personal rating for this game is 7/10 tacos. 8/10 tacos if played in VR. And it also gets a 9/10 tacos if you play it in VR and have some form of a joystick and throttle for the full experience.", "timestamp_created": 1736630972, "timestamp_updated": 1736630972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535040438175201416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185382184": {"recommendationid": "185382184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198894857563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1224, "playtime_at_review": 2265, "last_played": 1737363264}, "language": "english", "review": "only game where you can assassinate high ranking political figures and visit a neutron star in the same hour", "timestamp_created": 1736628410, "timestamp_updated": 1736628410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185380473": {"recommendationid": "185380473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255154184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1736631803}, "language": "english", "review": "Baller space balling", "timestamp_created": 1736627038, "timestamp_updated": 1736627038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459882587194442749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185378379": {"recommendationid": "185378379", "author": {"steamid": "76561199414072827", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 620, "playtime_at_review": 4370, "last_played": 1737176203}, "language": "english", "review": "space lazada delivery simulator", "timestamp_created": 1736625404, "timestamp_updated": 1736625404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185378217": {"recommendationid": "185378217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088654167", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 60855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 406, "playtime_at_review": 60630, "last_played": 1737236431}, "language": "english", "review": "Elite Dangerous is the a space sim that has quite deep learning curve with it.

It does everything right but also does the wrong things even wrongererer. This Game is not your friend and will not hold your hand outside of the tutorials and this goes for everything in the game. Along with that some things are more tedious then they need to be even though it is a sim. But dont let it throw you off, this is a 1:1 scale of the universe and you are but the smallest speck making a difference and you feel that, even in the most dense of systems you still feel lonely and small.

There are so many complex systems that were put together in a beautiful fashion and I believe the developers either accomplished or nearly accomplished all that they set out to do. \n\nFirst and foremost, Elite Dangerous is not a game. It is a futuristic space exploration simulator that is attempting to replicate as much realism, physics and science as the engine can support. After around 15+ hours invested I realized I was enjoying this much more than I've enjoyed my usual rotation of games.\n\nUPDATE: I originally submitted a negative review of this game, and then I tried to edit it and Steam threw my edits out. Instead of redoing all that work I'm going to summarize a few points that new players need to bear in mind.\n\nTHIS SIM WILL NOT HOLD YOUR HAND.  If you hate learning by making mistakes, you're going to be very, very frustrated.\n\nIf you do not have a flight controller, look for tutorials on how to better map the keyboard and mouse controls before you start doing flight missions. Trust me on this one, the defaults are terrible.\n\nThis sim is very, very simmy. Most players will probably want to do as many tutorial missions as possible before starting actual missions in the main game. I was not so patient, therefore I've been learning \"the hard way\".\n\nThe initial flight training that is required before you can fly your ship puts you on training wheels. An actual mission will feel very different. That's normal.\n\nGet very comfortable with looking things up online.\n\nIf you don't like Star Trek, NASA, Space X or sci fi in general, you probably will not enjoy Elite Dangerous. If you do like these things, I highly recommend giving it a try, especially if its on sale.\n\nAs an apology to Frontier for my initial negative review, I'll be picking up some ARX even though I normally don't spend real money on in-game currency.", "timestamp_created": 1736431571, "timestamp_updated": 1736642117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532684862613677979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185183143": {"recommendationid": "185183143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869057065", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3490, "playtime_at_review": 5397, "last_played": 1737158068}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic space sim.

(a little heads up before you read: i don't claim to be experienced and i definitely am not experienced. this review is from a beginner's perspective.)\n\nthis game has the steepest learning curve i've ever seen in my life but it is pretty rewarding after you get the hang of how things work. this could be discouraging for some but if you like space, exploration, or anything related, i recommend the game regardless. yes, the only criterion for me to recommend this game is whether you like space or not.\n\ntutorials on youtube and the game's wiki will be your best friends in learning how to play. if you dont like that idea, you can always join some beginner friendly squadrons in the game and ask any question to experienced players.\n\nsure, some people may not like the excessive grind on some aspects or find the game \"pointless\" as it doesn't have any end goal and that it's just about buying new ships and what not. i get them, reviews are meant to be totally subjective anyway. i do think however that people who say the game is \"pointless\" would also enjoy the game if they lived the moment and didn't worry about what they will have ahead of them after completing their current objective. the journey itself you embark on is pretty fascinating with the amount of detail the game offers. based on this, im pretty sure you will not run out of things to do for a fairly good amount of time, also considering how active the community is on various other platforms. i personally enjoyed this game a lot in my very limited amount of playtime, knowing damn well that there's no end goal. im also willing to play a lot more.\n\nif you are interested, there are countless systems waiting to be discovered, countless goods to be hauled, countless asteroids to be mined, countless conflicts involving combat to be a part of, countless rare goods to be smuggled, countless life forms to be logged, and practically infinite amount of bounties to be claimed in the milky way. hope to see you in the game. o7", "timestamp_created": 1736335948, "timestamp_updated": 1736335948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634146332740783691",

I bought the game on Christmas sale for ~8 euros, dlc included, so I was set back with 2 beers (not the end of the world). I thought what the hell, it can't be worse than Loadfield. All I wanted was a shooter, in space if possible, maybe with some cool ships and a bit of real exploration. I launched it and did the on-foot tutorial (not knowing I'm doing the on-foot tutorial) and although it looked interesting I felt like I was somewhere in HL2 in terms of graphics. After finishing the tutorial and being dumped in the starter space city I managed to exit the game and optimize the graphic settings. Restarted and deliberately done the full space flight tutorial from the tutorials menu. Man, I can't say it was that hard but damn, it felt so uncomfortable. No joystick, no nothing. Just keyboard and mouse. The game looked absolutely better after putting the correct graphic settings for my rig but damn the space controls felt... almost uncontrollable. Managed not to crash my ship, managed to finish the tutorial, NOT managed how to shoot the minigun even though I was able to understand the secondary weapon is bound to mouse2. Killed everything with weapon no.1 aka the laser beam. Did more tutorials because I felt like John Snow, I knew NOTHING. Stood like a moron for minutes in the basic flight when asked to tilt my ship with the mouse until I realized I was in free look mode aka mouse3. Did the mining tutorial, realizing that if I have to scoop every time I mine something I may loose my freaking mind. Did the manual landing tutorial and did it well, even though it took longer than expected. Decided I will always use the auto land/launch from now on. All in all, tutorials left me more confused than I'd expect so I decided to go all in and see what the actual game has to offer. To my surprise before I could leave the starting city I had to do the full space flight tutorial all over again, because this time a NPC asked me to do it before I could access the ship dock elevator. This time around I managed to shoot the minigun, who would've thought it had a spin-up time and I had to keep mouse2 down before it actually started shooting. But while fighting the drones I kinda forgot the ship moves better when also pressing A & D, so this time around it took me even longer to maneuver and turn the ship around. Frustration grew, but looking back at it, that was definitely my fault. In the end I managed to actually fly my ship for the first time for real, then land back to the starting city. Then wasted a ton of time trying to figure out how to access my inventory. For REAL! I had to GOOGLE how to OPEN MY INVENTORY, even after going though all the keybinds. That was the last straw. If I have to google a simple freaking task as opening my backpack - that means everything else will be much more frustrating. I have almost 2000 hours in No Man's Sky, don't even get me started about EVE(ry phycho) Online, but this game is a different beast. I'm not saying it's a bad game, because I literally know 0.01% of what it has to offer, but the learning curve for a beginner is very discouraging. It was easy to find the shop though.\r\nSo, if you're new and excited, all I can say is take your time. I may not abandon it but after the tutorials I'm at a bit of a loss. Not sure if it's worth the time investment in learning it via google.

I'm not recommending this game because the VR support is crap, it's basically just 3d goggles so you get a 3d immersive view, but the VR aspect stops there, you have to use an xbox controller and the key mappings are super confusing. WARNING: You must be an experienced player to play in VR.. if you don't know what you're doing you're going to get yourself stuck somewhere. I decided tonight to try it out in VR after not playing for a few years, I'm still a newbie and just have a Sidewinder and hardly any cash. I just spent about 2 hours being frustrated at how confusing the controls are, and realizing that a mission that was available to me to take was impossible to get to with a 7LY jump range ship like I have. One major frustration I have is that it's difficult to arrive and dock at a station. In Star Citizen, I fly close enough with really fast in system thrusters and get a waypoint to fly to after talking to landing services. In Elite, I try to fly close enough to my target, but pass it over by 7 days in the span of 2 seconds trying to slow down the FSD that is still engaged for some reason even though other times its not engaged still after a jump. Since I missed it, I had to try to fly sublight to it and even with boosts it's a solid 5 day flight. I could try to FSD jump to it, but it's light seconds away not light years. Overall just not a user friendly experience. I would recommend Star Citizen in it's unfinished state over this game.

I'm exactly 100 hours in and I've done most aspects of the game.  I've completed all the Fed and Empire ranks to level 12, so I've unlocked all the ships.  I have around 15 ships (including the most expensive in the game - the Cutter).  I've done asteroid mining, transportation, explored outside the bubble, and I have 1.5 billion credits in the bank.  I've unlocked around 15-20 engineers and most of my ships are engineered to level 3 or 5 on fundamentals like FSD, shield generator, shield boosters, lasers, cannons, thrusters, power plant, etc.  I have enough materials and money that i will be able to go fully engineered on my next ship build - a combat Corvette.  Then I imagine i will go for a fleet ship or wait until system colonisation is released in 2025.

Even the most desolate rocks out in the universe still look amazing, and the sky-box is down right mesmerizing, with every star in the sky actually moving positions in the sky as you move from start system to start system.\r\n2) The game is massive, a complete 1:1 scale of the Milky Way Galaxy. If you ever wanted to travel to Sagittarius A and see the black hole at the center of the universe, you can do so; just expect to take a few hours of flight time to get there because it ain't close. (To set expectations though, black holes in the game are the one thing lacking visually and I hope one day they re design them)\r\n3) The game has a lot to do. Want to be a bounty hunter? Go do it! Want to be a pirate? Go do it! You want to mine ore from asteroids and/or haul thousands of tons of materials or trade goods across the galaxy in a massive fleet carrier? Go do it!\r\n\r\nOn top of all the above, we are getting the ability to colonize new star systems soon which will give the players the ability to build (pre-designed) space stations and star ports in currently unoccupied systems, bringing a whole new way to play the game in 2025; not to mention the possibility that a new alien conflict is likely to happen in the future after we start expanding outward so there is that to look forward to as well.\r\n\r\nIf I have to give one caveat about the game, it's that the game has no structure. It is a sandbox game through and through, so if the idea of coming up with your own objectives in an open ended game doesn't sound like fun to you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, if that all sounds great to you, welcome to the galaxy commander! o7", "timestamp_created": 1735770044, "timestamp_updated": 1735770044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876056373119354248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184464559": {"recommendationid": "184464559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133028015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 30635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3770, "playtime_at_review": 23423, "last_played": 1737361639}, "language": "english", "review": "An open galaxy phenomenon. It goes way past an open world, way past a living world,  beyond a sandbox in almost all aspects short of a few things. It is a world class flying and space simulator with bustling markets and stations which - most of you can explore on foot now. It lets you be in any role you want, pledge to any faction, or even fight aliens.\nGraphics - 6/10 slightly outdated\nSound - 10/10 listen to those engines\nStory - debatable if there even is one?\nPhysics - 9/10 you can even blackout from g forces\n\nYour galaxy your choices. It's not a dialogue based game but it's a role based game. There is a story and lore but it's not as obvious to find it. Part of the story comes back around to secret organizations (players still searching to this day), secret experiments, and aliens. What will hit you first in terms of story is the obvious power play which is your pledge to factions which helps shape the galaxy and known systems.\n\nThey have long supported this game and unlike Star Citizen, it's a fully released game with the promises they've made. Even adding more all the time. It's more realistic than No Mans Sky, although perhaps not as deep with species and discovery.\n\nWhat this game could use more of? Better textures perhaps, businesses, income possibilities. They are adding colonization of star systems but it would be nice to be able to own your own shops for passive income. There are fleet carriers, but most players seem to avoid them because so many don't have what you need and when they do - they set theIr own prices whereas it's easier to travel somewhere for 2 minutes for 1/10th the price. Also, you often never know what a fleet carrier has for sale or purchase before visiting it.\n\nAside from that, I would absolutely recommend this labor of love.", "timestamp_created": 1735764054,

The game has several complex systems overlaid on top of each other to simulate a space-exploration sim but really you're managing a heads up display and a star chart as well as 30 different reddit/wiki tabs. \r\n\r\nThe only tutorial the game provides you with is how to fly and how your guns work in groundside combat, which is fine if the information for LITERALLY anything else was inside of a menu in game or if windows had an optional help button for navigation. Instead you're required to fumble around with a single save-slot to your account, all of the cosmetics are tied to the earnable end game currency - which also resets between character, and potentially just waste 40 hours before you actually have a concept of an understanding of what to do in this game. There are two kinds of people who play elite dangerous, People who enjoy space-exploration simulation games, and people who enjoy reading reddit threads. You cannot go into this game with prior experience of another simulation game because most of the rules are thrown out the window for arbitrary complex systems that aren't present in most other space faring sims.

I understand some games like to just throw you into the thick of it but there are way too many systems and game mechanics here to justify it even in the slightest. I  got so frustrated trying to figure out the controls, some of them not even having key bindings (this game is a nightmare to play on controller by the way)\n\nThe worst experience I had was when I got fined. When you get fined you cannot refuel at the station in the faction you are fined in, even if you're out of fuel, so imagine my surprise when I go to refuel at a station and I can't repair or refuel my ship. Does the game tell you about fines? nope. Does it tell you how to pay off fines? nope. I spent a good twenty minuets just trying to figure out THE BASIC MECHANICS OF THE GAME. I should not have to go outside the game to figure out how to play it, I really can't express how terrible the new player experience was.\n\nEven when I looked up a tutorial on YouTube the guy REALLY wasn't selling the game to me and was also complaining about the same things I was!!! AND THE TUTORIAL WAS TWO YEARS OLD!!!!\n\nAlso, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME WITH VR IN MIND. It really feels like the VR version of this game was made for people already familiar with the game. It also has a lot of optimization issues, I've had things on my screen only show up in one eye and not the other making it hurt my eyes to look at, its disorienting and there is absolutely no anti aliasing so everything looks like shit.\n\nMy whole experience was confusing and frustrating, I genuinely don't understand how some people actually got into this game with all the hurdles you have to go through.

The game focuses on exploration, offering over 400 billion star systems. But the catch is that about 98% of them are lifeless, boring, and repetitive.\n\nPicture this: You\u2019re excited to embark on a journey and uncover the galaxy\u2019s secrets. You make a jump and find a system with a few metallic and rocky planets plus a gas giant - cool. Then you make another jump, and another: the 5th, the 10th, the 50th, the 100th\u2026 and it\u2019s basically the same stuff every time. All these planets are essentially reskins of one another, with minimal color variation and zero unique features. There\u2019s nothing happening on the surface\u2014everything\u2019s a lifeless desert. They didn\u2019t even bother adding basic events like auroras! And space itself is just as empty\u2014there\u2019s nothing going on anywhere.\n\nYou might think the Odyssey DLC, with its atmospheric planets, would add some variety. Wrong! They\u2019re the same dull planets but with a bit of sky. There\u2019s no real flora or fauna - just maybe a few plants here and there.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t get me wrong. There are indeed some truly amazing and breathtaking places in the galaxy. The game can be beautiful in the right spots, but most of those are so far away that traveling there feels like a tedious hyperspace grind. For me, exploration isn\u2019t worth the hassle; it starts to feel like a chore.\n\nWhat I do like is the overall aesthetic of the game. They nailed the ship handling, and the sound design is pure bliss to my ears. The combat system is also solid - PvP is fun, and hunting Thargoids (the hostile alien civilization) is especially thrilling.\n\nSo why did I give the game a positive review if most of my comments are negative? Personally, I don\u2019t want to trash the game entirely. It\u2019s good at what it does, and if it keeps making money, the developers can hopefully keep expanding it with amazing updates and content.\n\nP.S.

It is prehistoric looking by today's standards, old looking when it came out, but the emergent gameplay was incredible. I've been putting off playing Elite Dangerous because I knew for sure it would be the only game I would ever play for a long time. Sadly, it didn't work out that way.\n\nI picked it up with the Odyssey dlc, and the jank started there. Dropped into the Odyssey starter mission, the game tried to show me a taste of what was to come -  a very, very mediocre FPS experience, with a fiddliness I'd expect from setting up a domino run, and a middling visual quality that did not support the performance. On finishing the mission, I eventually ended up at the starter hub. \n\nI took a break, and came back to the game, and tried the tutorial instead of continuing. This was the Elite I knew and space flight was interesting and detailed. So I continuted my game, and was told to start the tutorial. Which I had just finished. I could skip it, but this is not a greate on-boarding experience for new gamers - even for ones who have some idea waht's exptected of them.\n\nI eventually got to fly a space ship wherever the hell I wanted, and that felt so right. I didn't have a clue what I should start with, so I picked a job at random and went for it. I suspected if I had given it enough time, I would have found something to move the plot forward, but i didn't care. Elite always was about making your mark in the game. And at this aspect, Elite Dangerous excels.\n\nUnfortunatley, while playing on SteamDeck is very doable, and performs well, ED is a game that needs to be connected to the internet at all times to work, even if you've chosen to play in a solo (with no other players) galaxy. That's unfortunate because when you put your Steamdeck to sleep, you disconnect. When you turn it back on, you'll get to play for a minute before an error appears, and the game kicks you back to the main menu. While the game is listed as \"playable\", I would argue if it cannot support a basic feature of portable gaming, then it really isn't. If you save and quit every time you want to stop playing, you'll probably have no issues. It's incredible this is even a problem, even Disney's Dreamlight Valley supports sleep mode, and a literal MMO The Elder Scrolls Online is fine with it.

Now I do like being able to run around the ship in Star Citizen, but I just cant with that game, raised 700k and still cant even get mesh collision working, but can expand their front store over and over, bah, Elite Dangerous give a complete experience with many jobs missions and roles. Easy Cargo hauls or intense dogfights. The ships also handle amazing, they are so much like handling a real vehicle, that they take some real learning to get down, cant just fly it around all crazy like other space games, its control design causes it to move and react more like a piece of heavy machinery. I also love the way the UI is the Characters UI as much as its the Players. And they though of everything, I was caught cargo full, way over power drain, pirate came for my haul, over 400k in illicit goods, couldnt engage my weapons cuz it caused me to go over my power limit, then life support would go off and shields would go down and after 1 shot the weapons power was drained too. Then I remembered this game gives the legit access to your modules mid-flight on one of your cockpit panels, went in, deactivated modules I didnt need, got the  power I needed and went from suffocating, getting shot at, almost losing my haul and my life, to whoopin dudes \"A\" and making my delivery just in time ! That level of stranded in space, with only my ingenuity and knowledge to survive, like some Apollo 13 Shht forreal !\n\nAlso the Ground fighting is way more clean and solid than I expected, by a long shot. Straight up great FPS quality, when I was afraid it would feel like an after thought.\n\nNow having said that, all the games Ive played have their merit, but lets talk about what sucks about Elite, Its REAL> and because its so raw, its hard. Whats more is, it has a complex world and system, with very little tutorial, The Training they do have, however.. is a crucial must, which I never do training and tutorials, but this game, you really need to. In fact in this game, you can die for landing on or loitering over the wrong landing pad. Its REALLY best to practice, ESPECIALLY Driving your ship, as if mastering the motion of a real vehicle, doing the flight training over and over like a 15 year old in the station wagon in a parking lot. And the main problem, there is no good references online. Even videos made by most content creators are showy but lack substance. So its hard to find places to learn from, my first 4 days were filled with endless hours of searching and watching and trying the hard way in game. Bottom line, this game might have one of the hardest learning curves with the least support out there. That being said, its so good, I was determined to make it work. Then after a while a series of break throughs and lots of research payed off. Once you figure it out, its easy as pie. Its starting thats super hard.\n\nWith that in mind, let me say what helps, Start with Data transport and small cargo runs to make money, YOU can make anywhere from 33k to 400k from these, I tend to stick to the 130k or higher runs. Second, find a place to get modules and get the Fuel Scoop and the Auto Docking Mechanism. These make it free to jump immediately from system to system refilling at each sun as you pass allowing you to travel infinite distances without stopping at a station, and the auto dock makes it much easier to land and take care of business if you do need to stop and get back going again.", "timestamp_created": 1735548248, "timestamp_updated": 1735804844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533678770065307617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184198827": {"recommendationid": "184198827", "author": {"steamid": "76561199065245772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1736832182}, "language": "english", "review": "Si", "timestamp_created": 1735546292, "timestamp_updated": 1735546292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184195695": {"recommendationid": "184195695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802994220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2570, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1736948275}, "language": "english", "review": "Already have over 300 hours in my epic copy of this game, decided to pick up a steam copy cause steam better (RIP epic).

Very detailed environmentally, however it does have lower graphics so it feels like the original mass effect (not a big deal if you are more concerned with the gameplay and time investment). The character customization, planets, space, npcs, ships, boots combat, and spaceports are cool and the devs have a lot of time put into the mechanics. I do wish the flying aspect was better and there is a lot of tabs/interactions and controls to get used to. The game feels like an older version of Warframe, No Mans Sky, and First Descendant, with a heavy dose of Mass Effect (kind of blocky/stiff like a physical arcade shooter; ie: Terminator or Jurassic Park).

No por nada, es el juego que m\u00e1s horas marca en mi biblioteca.\r\nTen\u00e9is que tener en cuenta que es y pretende ser un simulador serio. Teniendo en cuenta que no puede simular nada, ya que a\u00fan no disponemos de tecnolog\u00eda similar, el manejo de las naves se siente muy real a los mandos. Puedes notar las diferencias entre las distintas naves y puedes sentir c\u00f3mo el volumen, tama\u00f1o y peso de las naves te obligan a pilotar diferente. Los diferentes componentes con los que puedes equipar estas naves hacen que se comporte de forma diferente. Dejando un poco de lado la sensaci\u00f3n a los mandos, los ciclos solares de los planetas, las distancias, las \u00f3rbitas, la gravedad diferente en cada planeta se ha dise\u00f1ado siguiendo patrones reales que puedes notar y sentir. De verdad sientes que est\u00e1s ah\u00ed.\r\nSobre el gameplay, no es juego muy amigable al principio, pero tampoco te lo pone dif\u00edcil. Digo que no es amigable porque no vas a encontrar misiones de historia que te digan qu\u00e9 hacer o por donde empezar o continuar. Eres t\u00fa en todo momento el que tiene que decidir qu\u00e9 hacer y a qu\u00e9 dedicarte. y aunque al principio no lo parezca, tienes muchas cosas diferentes que poder hacer. Mi mejor consejo es ser paciente ya que no vas a conseguir nada de forma r\u00e1pida pero es igual de disfrutable desde el minuto 1. Este juego no tiene end game, por lo que el objetivo es el que t\u00fa te marques.\r\nEst\u00e1s en un universo vivo en el que ocurren cosas en las que puedes decidir participar o no. Depende de ti.

Not knowing much about their games, my first encounter with Elite Dangerous was at a game convention in London, where their marketing team was there to demo their CQC mode in VR.\n At the time, I thought \"OK, its a VR game with some nice SFX, but not my thing\". That was because I went in my first session thinking I was playing a space action game, where you just mindlessly blast things.\n\n Fast-forward a year or two, and I finally buy the game around the time Horizons comes out.. where it sits unplayed for another year or so.. due to my huge Steam game library backlog.\n I finally get around to playing it around the time of Odyssey release, where this time I realize my first impression of the game were wrong but... I am still not convinced.. because the game feels empty and repetitive with the same generated missions showing up at stations. This left me with the same feeling that I am just playing an action game with not much to do. So I put the game down for yet another year or so.\n\n Then suddenly, after looking for something to scratch a space itch I was having. I try Elite Dangerous again.. this time with PATIENCE. Like I had all of time in the world, ready to soak up the hours of YouTube videos ahead of me with unwavering determination. I finally start making achievements in the game, and with each I start getting more and more hooked. I finally...\n - Fine-tune my flight controls, and stop crashing into stations (the mailboxes)\n - Start to thoroughly understand my ship fittings\n - Finally make an effort to understand the universe map and all the various icons\n - Start getting into all of the disciplines (Mining, Trading, Bounty Hunting, Exploration, etc.)\n - Learn engineering\n - Read GalNet and start making sense that there more than meets the eye, the news actually matters\n - Start realizing this is a universe and is heavily narrative-driven\n - Discover the amazing community and join up with Anti-Xeno Initiative to face off in Xeno battles\n - Start making my own goals, like build up money for a fleet carrier and plan a first trip to Colonia\n\n I must admit I was very wrong about this game for years. Elite Dangerous is not an space action game, it is actually a sandbox about curiosity, exploration and discovery. The action is just a small part of what is a massive game with so much to do!\n\n Now.. on to see if I can get a job at FDev to push out some updates just a tad faster... Hi there FDev!

They dont really start you off with a guide on how to slowly do ground mission with proper leveling. This was just a feature thrown into a game without it properly implemented. \n\nTbh ground combat is just insanely impossible, there is not even affordable armors, or good guns. At least lower the damage on npc if your going to raid a 1 entry level bases , where you have a single guard drone taking nearly 3/4 of your health on a dual base that looks the same 2x times around same stupid lifeless planets.\n\nIn a nutshell there no real exploration either, its just the same boring planets with different colors. No real areas or places to explore. So to me ya this game kinda lacks real exploration.\n\nNow i will give it a 5 / 10 just for the real space simulations in terms of traveling but as far as real game play it just lacks tremendously that it kinda ruins the game. You can get tired of flying by the same planet or mission millions of times, some times ive gotten it, but alot times i cant pin point the mission planet, as there is bugs. There this black hole in this game that bothers me as much as you want to like it, and try very hard, there just too many bugs/problems.\n\nNow that starfield is out its just a better game overall, and the action is there. I dont even care about the cut scenes either. So in my opinion, cool if you want to play ED, for just a tech demo as space travel, but to me its nothing more than this. I dont care how many people sugar coat it, the game play is not there. Ya some of the space ports look interesting but still they just need to work on a the game. The game is too damn hard! period...\n\nIf they can come out with Elite Dangerous 2 and work on the real leveling and mix real ground play, with realism and more realistic difficulty.

The vastness of the galaxy, the freedom to explore, trade, fight, or even just hang out in space, is a dream for anyone who\u2019s ever wanted to be a part of a living, breathing universe. The graphics are amazing, the attention to detail is impressive, and there's always something new to discover.\n\nThat being said, Elite Dangerous is definitely a game that demands a lot of time and patience. The learning curve can be steep, especially for new players. The controls, mechanics, and the sheer scale of the game can feel overwhelming at first, and it can take a while to truly grasp all the nuances. But once you get past the initial hurdles, the rewards are incredibly satisfying.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the game\u2019s pace can feel slow, especially if you're used to more action-packed titles. You\u2019ll spend a lot of time mining, trading, or just flying between systems, which is great for immersion, but not necessarily for those looking for a quick fix.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re willing to invest the time and effort, Elite Dangerous offers an experience unlike any other. It\u2019s not for everyone, but if you\u2019re patient and love the idea of exploring the stars, this game is a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1735224596, "timestamp_updated": 1735224596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183756008": {"recommendationid": "183756008", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196038764", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1735235912}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0443 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u0438\u0430\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446", "timestamp_created": 1735223294, "timestamp_updated": 1735223294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183750531": {"recommendationid": "183750531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881330700", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64164, "last_played": 1735765452}, "language": "german", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1735219683, "timestamp_updated": 1735219683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183745999": {"recommendationid": "183745999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117681157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 92638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5260, "playtime_at_review": 79078, "last_played": 1737414135}, "language": "romanian", "review": "total", "timestamp_created": 1735216560, "timestamp_updated": 1735216560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183740208": {"recommendationid": "183740208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091383856", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1383, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1737306391}, "language": "italian", "review": "Un universo da esplorare almeno una volta nella vita.", "timestamp_created": 1735211655, "timestamp_updated": 1735211655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183738087": {"recommendationid": "183738087", "author": {"steamid": "76561199682491919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1737071487}, "language": "english", "review": "I have over 300 hours in No Man's Sky, and was interested in trying out this game, as I had heard it was very difficult.

I didn't think I would like the game since I kinda lean to story driven games.  I tell ya, this game surprised me a good deal.  I find the game quite relaxing as I have spent most of my time mining and flying around.  I love the idea of the fuel scoop, it would have been nice knowing about it before I ran out.  I have exploded once due to boosting during superdrive, I have alot to learn.  I haven't even started running any missions at all so I can't comment on those.
