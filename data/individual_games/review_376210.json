(Legacy is the og game, Evrima is public beta that gets updates and is a lot more advanced). \r\n\r\nLEGACY\r\n\r\nIt's fun (I have 1000 hours in it...) BUT its the result of the devs trying to build a city on a single twig. The systems are simple (which can be a good or bad thing). There a lots of dinosaurs, and unlike evrima you can play rex :) None of the dinosaurs are very unique however. The maps are a mixed bag. V3 is big and nice but has some areas that are way too empty, and Thenyaw is way to small and crampt. \r\n\r\nMany people can never find any english servers and only see chinese servers. There are videos on Yt on how to join english servers.\r\n\r\nNote: If you don't like mix packing (dinosaurs of diff species grouping), there aren't really any servers for you. \r\n\r\nSo, Legacy is fun if you like the simple mechanics and just want to have dino eat dino. It doesn't recieve updates anymore.\r\n\r\nEVRIMA\r\n\r\nThe game is hard to run, first thing to note. It's horrible optimized, and your FPS can suck (Although personally its been better recently). The dinosaur roster is starting to get big, not much smaller than Legacy, and most of them are very unique. Most dinosaurs in the game are \"small\" which I like, but if you want to be a giant rex, you cant. \r\n\r\nEvrima is very atmospheric and you really do feel like a dinosaur when ur not having 2 fps. \r\n\r\nIf you can actually run it, evrima is very fun. It only recieves an update about once a year however. \r\n\r\nNote: for both versions of the game, they do not give you any sort of tutorial, I suggest you go watch some videos to learn the game a little first. \r\n\r\nI'd give the isle an overall 7/10!\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1737309639, "timestamp_updated": 1737309639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

Water is bugged out with black boxes so you can't enjoy playing crocs. Music and ambiance just bug out constantly when walking around. The AI are broken as ever. Rubberbanding is an issue. Screen tearing is an issue. It's a game with A LOT of bugs, and it's been like this for 2 YEARS. Nothing has been fixed and it seems devs just don't care, they don't listen to their community.

The models are beautiful and the creatures have really cool sound design. This game has several neat mechanics and plenty of places to explore but there is one huge problem that I personally have with it.\nIf you die as an adult(usually takes irl HOURS to grow) you lose literally all your progress and start from scratch. I loved this game, but such a loss makes it hard to come back after you have spent hours trying to grow just to be killed by a troll who just leaves your body there.\n\nThis game has an amazing idea, however it is not for me.

There is some small bugs but that is easily overlook by the overall aspect of the game.  The major turn off is the way people will play the game. You guys know the expression: This is why we can't have nice things.>>  Its not specific to this game, in my opinion it is generalised with the only gaming/pvp community. Find the meta or the short video on youtube that explains it and abuse it.  In this case, it will be the mix packing of various dinos that will give an unfair advantage to a group of players.

cant seem to grasp a issue with the game and instead of listening to the community they say \"lets buff herbivores\"\n2.AI spawn are almost non-exsistent (they are working on this to their credit) it makes a rainforest feel like a weird bizzare wasteland\n3.the map....I LOVE IT buttttt its too big, to the point i rarely see players unless i go to a hotspot thats basically a free for all, now im not suggesting they shrink the map but instead raise player count by at least 100 (so 200-250 instead of the norm)\n4. cheaters, i havent encountered any that i know of but many people complain and show proof of them so the anti cheat needs a fix or somethin\n\non another note the discord community is great i would have refunded cuz i didnt understand a thing about this game but now i enjoy it

[/i]\n*This was fine with me, since I wanted to play Evrima anyway, but the fact that you HAD to jump through this hoop to even play was quite ridiculous.\n\n [h3] Game-play: [/h3]\nMy experience was nothing like the YouTubers playing the Isles, with one exception;  I did get attacked once by another baby dino, but sadly, aside from two other uneventful encounters with players, I spent two hours wandering the landscape completely and utterly alone.

But alas.. nothing.  \n*I don't know where all 100-200 players were in the 4 servers I tried, but they were not near me. \n**I tried 2 Official and 2 unofficial servers.\n\n\n[h3] Mechanics: [/h3]\nThere really wasn't any explanation to anything in the game.\nThey just plop you down in a bush as a Baby and let you figure out what all the keys do on your own.\nI'm all for the idea of hard-coring it, but I would appreciate a small tutorial, a short note, or at least a key for the Sense meter.\nWhen it came to how close you are to dying, forget it, a part from the blood splatters on the screen, it was almost impossible to tell if I was minutes or seconds from death.\n*Honestly, If I hadn't watched a few hours of game-play on YouTube before playing this, I'd have been completely lost.\n\n[h3] My favorite Parts: [/h3]\nI found it enjoyable to jump from tree-to-tree and cliffside-to-cliffside as a Herrera, swim as a Therizinosaur, and invoke revenge on the chickens as a Diabloceratops.\n\n[h3] Summery: [/h3]\nThe game had some very nice 2020's graphics, sounds terrific, and provides a platform for you to enjoy starving to death as you sniff the air hoping that its the tree your suppose to bite and not the flowers.\nAll in all, this game seemed empty, it felt like it had been abandoned, and life was rare to see.\n\nI purchased 'The Isles' along side 'Path of Titans' to give each of them a fair chance.\nup to this point, I've only played 2 hours of each.\nAs much as I wanted 'The Isles' to be a keeper, it doesn't feel finished, and feels extremely Empty.\nWhile playing Titans I almost immediately met other players, and was able to connect in a way that just wasn't possible in 'The Isles'.  *Heck, I even got attacked by a baby dino in the same way!\nBut at least there were other players around.

I have not played legacy.)\n\nI love this game. I think that there is a satisfying learning curve to it. Yes, you will spend your first few hours running around dying to either starvation or bigger dinos, as there currently isn't any sort of tutorial in EVRIMA. But then you'll start to learn what sounds each AI prey will make, as well as the calls of the other playable dinos. It is also extremely easy to just look up pointers online, as there are plenty of resources for it. I like the realism of having to actually think and work for your food rather than it just being handed to you on a silver platter. That's what survival games are meant to be. If you don't like the idea of this, then maybe it isn't the game for you.\n\nI will admit, I do think that some of the herbis are a bit overpowered and even a group of fully grown omniraptors can struggle to take down a larger herbivore. But in that case, you just learn to avoid them. Wait for something bigger and stronger to come along and then go and scavenge for the leftovers afterwards. \n\nThere does seem to be an issue with hackers, although I am thankfully yet to encounter one. I have probably just got lucky.  This is an issue that definitely needs to be addressed, and hopefully will come in time as I am sure the devs are more than aware of it. \n\nI think that from what I've read in the negative reviews, it's mainly just salty players who haven't actually given this game a chance (sub 3 hrs playtime). It definitely gets more enjoyable the more you play and learn the mechanics. However, the development is objectively quite slow. If that isn't for you, then don't buy the game.

The problem emerges after spending time being a humble student of the wilderness. You spend hours honing your reflexes, learning your strengths and weaknesses. You use your hard earned skills to stalk, and kill your prey, then that pray tells his 6 comrades on discord where you are and you find a herd of both carnivores and herbivores of all types heading towards your location or their friends body. Maybe you out maneuver them all, disengage and continue with your life. 15 minutes later you make it to the next hotspot only to realized you've been playing for 2 hours after you got home from work and its 11pm now theirs not enough people in the server and you have to log out or starve to death. Next day 3 fully grown herbivores decide they are bored and use their unmatched attack and defenses to kill everything around on sight and guard the body. You were a smart player and watched your stamina on your way there so you can retreat if a situation like that occurred but because of that you also took too long to get there and are now starving with no time to make a similar trip to the next spot. Game offers a map that is 14km*2 but only 100 players(coming from someone who has crawled through the forest for an hour to find a bear in Call Of The Wild. This means know the hotspots or starve).\n When you learn the game and the servers, instances like this will be rarer but WILL still happen. It is part of any game. The problem is this game tries to be something it cant. That no game can be. Truly realistic. The devs realized this after release, scraped the first version, released an almost entirely different game and the same thing happens. Now its just a slow trickle of adding content every now and then to get a little surge in sales.

They're easier to grow, easier to play, and usually fight better than their carnivore counterparts. In a word: better. Carnivores just eat each other, because the map is too damn big and AI doesn't seem to spawn except in singular spots that, of course, get camped. And if they try to fight an herbivore, they either can't catch it or get killed by it, unless they vastly outsize their prey.\r\n\r\nYour typical server ends up being split in two; the herbivores sit around eating bushes that don't run away from them and kill any carnivore that comes too close, and the carnivores run around trying to find a food spawn, usually failing and dropping dead. Many servers clear corpses to reduce lag, so even these carnivores dropping dead all over the place aren't contributing to the problem.\r\n\r\nThis game needs two kinds of servers; carnivore servers, where everyone's competing to hunt and grow and fight each other, and herbivore servers, where it's a cooperative game about surviving (AI) dinosaur terrors that want to eat you. Both of these are quality ideas for a game. Smooshing them together sounds like a good idea, but because of the way this game functions as-is, it just fails at either.\r\n\r\nThe map is too big, as well. Vast swathes of it are empty death traps where nothing spawns, with no visual tell as to which is which. Exploration is actively punished, and any landmark you see has nothing for you. If you're an explorer, DO NOT BUY. You will hate it. It's baffling that this game managed to make a Pteranodon's flight feel so meaningless and bad.\r\n\r\nThis game is a perfect example of how you can get caught in the details and miss the bigger picture. Tweaking dino stats will NEVER solve this game's problems. Evrima was supposed to be an overhaul, and it was, but it only made the carnivore situation worse.\r\n\r\nAs for Omnivores?

Endlich ein gutes Qualitatives Dino Spiel und das von einem kleinen Entwickler Studio! Obacht es ist ein Early Acces Titel f\u00fcr 20\u20ac. Nicht vergleichbar mit AAA Titel von gro\u00dfen Firmen die Million\u00e4n Budgets haben....und selbst die vermasseln es regelm\u00e4\u00dfig.\n\nIch \u00fcbernehme auch keine Haftung f\u00fcr Rechtschreibfehler und diese Reszission spiegelt meine Meinung wieder und soll garantiert niemanden Pers\u00f6nlich angreifen! Also seit Lieb \u2665\n\nVorab muss ich betonen das ich erst seit kurzem das Spiel verfolge und Spiele. Kann zu \u00e4lteren Zust\u00e4nden des Spieles leider keine Meinung abgeben. Im Aktuellen Zustand ist \"The Isle : Evrima\" aber klasse (Besser geht nat\u00fcrlich immer)!! Weshalb ich viele negative Aktuellen Kommentare (von den letzten 2-3 Wochen) nicht verstehen kann dazu aber sp\u00e4ter.\n\n:::Rezension:::\n\nW\u00e4r ein Hardcore Survival Game mit Dinos sucht, wo man Taktisch und Strategisch vorgehen muss, ist hier auf jedenfall richtig! Ich kann aber verstehen wenn es nicht jedem's Geschmack trifft. Es ist Schwer hineinzukommen und braucht eine Zeit bis man sich richtig wohlf\u00fchlt. Wenn du Stirbst ist dein Dino weg und du beginnst von vorne. Wer das alles nicht mag ist hier Falsch. Hat man aber die Mechanic's der Dinos verstanden und wei\u00df wie man vorgehen muss und man hat noch ein paar Freunde im Schlepptau dann wirst du den Spa\u00df und nerven kitzel deines Lebens haben.\n\nGrafisch ist das Spiel, bis auf einige Textur bug's und Glitches, richtig gut. Die Map Gateway und ihre Biome sind liebevoll gestaltet. Selten solch eine Tolle Karte gesehen wo auch tats\u00e4chlich die Fauna zum Tarnen genutzt werden kann und auch genutzt werden muss! Da haben viele AAA Titel ihre Probleme wo aber hier gut funktioniert.\n\nDie Dino Mechanic's finde ich auch sehr gut gelungen. Man muss sie nur verstehen, lernen wie man sie Erfolgreich ein\u00e4tzt und man wird erfolg haben. Zwar hatte das \"Troodon\" und der \"Dilo\" in der Realit\u00e4t kein Gift und das ist eher Fantasy. Dennoch finde ich die Spielweise gut Gelungen!!\n\nDie Dinos selber sind auch sehr Realistisch (Nach heutigen Wissenschaftlichen stand) dargestellt. Zumindest zu 80% Nat\u00fcrlich gibt es hier und da auch Freiraum f\u00fcr eigene Interpretationen. Schlie\u00dflich Zocken wir ein PC Spiel und keine 100% Wissenschaftlich standfest Fundierte ZDF Dokumentation. \n\nKurz und Knapp. Tolles, grafisch gute gelungenes Dino Spiel, wo viel Spa\u00df bringen kann und das f\u00fcr den kleinen Geldbeutel!

Along with bugs like eating certain plants causes you to have to rejoin the server, being unable to safe-log, which results in you being stuck in a large queue and possibly die to a newborn Beipi. Some of the community is great, some of it isn't. That's just how communities will be.\n\nBUT, there is a serious cheater infestation in the official servers and they have a very small unpaid team (who have jobs and lives outside of the game) that handle it, you don't get the 5+ hours of your life that you spent growing a dino back, as they aren't allowed to give you it back, even if you have solid undeniable evidence. 9/10 of the administrators seem to make little to no effort to engage with reports, and by the time they get around to doing anything about it, the cheaters have murdered half of the server and gone to

He also sometimes implements random changes that make no sense or are supposed to make sense with \"Future content\" but break balance in the current state of the game. His behaviour is perceived by many as impulsive, toxic and childish.\n\n-The map is way to big and empty for the game. Where there aren't players AI does not spawn either causing cernivores to start unless they visit a player hotspot. Of those there is exactly ONE at the south river. All action is concentrated at a 200mx200m area. Look up hotspot maps if you don't believe me.\n\n-The official servers are plagued by cheaters flying around with land carnivores, killing players while they themselves are in godmode. This is not due to bad anti-cheat alone but also due to awefully client sided game design. Calculating damage and health client sided is something no experienced multiplayer dev would do.\n\n-There are admins that you can contact via Discord, sadly they will simply ignore any DMs although that is the official way of reporting cheaters. They also do no compensate players for dinos lost that way even when they got proof.\n\n-Gameplay is boring due to most of the map being lifeless. Also stamina regen makes the game a sitting simulator for pteranodon players. \n\n-When the servers are empty you'll die of starvation if the game does not decide to spawn AI near you, which it rarely does.\n\n-The AI spawn system actively discourages looking for food and rewards just staying in one area.\n\n-Evrima has way less Dinosaurs which is a problem since the DEFAULT branch (Legacy) is dead. I don't get why they don't make Evrima default then...\n\n-The Evrima branch start menu breaks at 21:9 and requires players to manually edit the gameusersettings.ini file.\n\n-There are many bugs like invisible birds attacking you if you play Ptera.\n\nDON'T buy it!", "timestamp_created": 1736335990, "timestamp_updated": 1736335990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185096777": {"recommendationid": "185096777", "author": {"steamid": "76561199806421809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4098, "playtime_at_review": 1322, "last_played": 1737403560}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e14\u0e35\u0e46\u0e46\u0e46\u0e46", "timestamp_created": 1736334347, "timestamp_updated": 1736334347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185096529": {"recommendationid": "185096529", "author": {"steamid": "76561199362526644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3480, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1737257449}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1736334090, "timestamp_updated": 1736334090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185094538": {"recommendationid": "185094538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039527026", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 9383, "last_played": 1736331216}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon jeu, cela peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s fun.\r\nGros b\u00e9mol, un jeu toujours pas fini alors que la premi\u00e8re version est sortie en 2015. \r\nLa nouvelle version est trop demandante, impossible de se faire rembourser apr\u00e8s plus de 150h de jeu, si je voulais y rejouer il faudrait que j'ach\u00e8te un nouveau pc.

Speaking of starving, the time it takes to starve makes 0 sense with how long the days and nights are, you will starve to death in less than a full day/night cycle.

Please release updates and content in a timely manner, this is wildly unprofessional for a studio with a single game in early access for almost a decade.\n3.

It's basically impossible to understand unless you use some outside resource.\n\nThe other issue was with the number of official servers.

In the debate of Path of Titans vs The Isle, having over 50 hours in both I would  prefer The Isle (Mostly because PoT questing to grow system is pretty annoying and boring, although the rest of the game is amazing). If you have become worried by the excessive growth times of the dinosaurs, there are accelerated growth servers (Isla Pandora 2X Growth 2X AI is my favorite). This game is amazing if you love nature and dinosaurs, since it very much leans into realism and has made the Biology nerd in me happy. However, the game updates much slower than Path of Titans does. The Isle devs, if you're reading this I would reccommend you make the apex dinosaurs DLCs so you can hire more staff and also limit the amount of people playing \"OP\" dinosaurs. Also it would be really cool if you went and tweaked how fast hunger depletes a bit just to make the game a bit less frustrating and more realistic. I have also found the playerbase to be very sweet and welcoming, especially on unofficial servers, which have more rules and are often moderated along with having a Discord. However, this is just constructive criticism I have, to minimize the flaws of the game in my opinion (but almost every game has some kind of flaws). If anyone wants to comment what dinosaur they are most excited for here is mine: Therizinosaurus :)\n\n(Or a big Saurapod like Puerto but they haven't announced the possibility of that in evrima)\n\nSUMMARY: Highly Reccommend, Realistic, Kind Playerbase (Especially in Unofficial Servers), Game Updates Slowly, Hunger System Flawed", "timestamp_created": 1736116427, "timestamp_updated":

dinosaurs whole leg breaking because it missed a step and slow regeneration of stamina for many different types of dinosaurs causing the player to have to walk for most of the game.

It's an afk/walking simulator that requires time investment to grow your dinos only to loose them to;\r\n\r\n- Cheaters, the games been out so long that you can break it in many ways. Most of the time you'll be resting in the middle of nowhere with a server population of 2 on a huge map and be discovered and one shot within 10mins or so. The other popular cheat is a Stego coming at you at 80km (normally limited to like 15-25km) faster than any other dino.\r\n- Sever performance, the LITERAL WORST of any game in history. I AM NOT JOKING. A game where poor decisions and timing means the difference between losing hours of progress is NOT the game that needs horrible rubberbanding, very poor colision detection, hit reg, massive delays and huge ping spikes. Server performance naturally gets worse with more players in dense zones. Averaging 50ms if you're isolated to 120ms in places with 20+ individuals (server pop cap is 100). There is also only 2 servers for Australia, so only 200 people can play at a time (though very rarely are they full, but that leads into the next issue).\r\n- The game will screw you, feeding and hunting are how you keep your dinos alive. For herbivoures, you'll have to migrate to food zones, a pain in the ass when you finally get to one then the server moves it instantly to the other side of a huge map. Carnivores must hunt either other players or A.I spawns. When the servers are full your only issue becomes the CHEATING. But with a server pop of 10 you really need to rely on A.I spawns. The devs claim they're more likely to occur close to migration zones to encourage PVP but in reality they are static on the map.

It's almost comical that, after nearly four years, we're still dealing with such an incomplete experience. The wait for promised content is painfully slow, and players are left to accept that \"new additions\" might arrive years after being teased. All that being said, this game is undeniably beautiful. The graphics and map design are stunning, though they're overshadowed by terrible optimisation issues and painfully small server sizes for a map this massive. If you were to ask me whether I\u2019d recommend it, my answer would be, absolutely\u2014in about 20-30 years when the game is actually finished(lets hope its not longer than that).

You spend 90% of your time wandering around doing nothing or growing in a bush. When the action happens is can be really fun but that's a very small portion of the game, the juice simply isn't worth the squeeze.\n\nPros: High highs, pulse raising chases and horror jump scares. Visually nice, immersive with scenic environments. I'm trying to thank of anything else positive to say and I am struggling. Mutations are fun i guess.\n\nCons: Horrid performance, if you have a low end PC don't even bother, i have like 50ish games ranging from new to old, this the worst FPS performance I've ever had.  Downtime, like I stated earlier you just walk aimlessly or sit in a bush AFK growing your Dino, bad design and extremely boring, oh and i forgot to mention there are a very limited amount of servers, so if you want to play on your native server, you can literally be looking at wait times of over an 1hr, no joke 1hr. Now for the most damning part, and ultimately what made me quit playing. The shear JANK of it all, bugs, glitches, server restarts, exactly like DAY Z it feels like a game that's never going to be finished despite being in development for 10yrs now. Every single time i logged i had to swap vsync on and off or else i would have 20 FPS. On character creator my mouse pointer dissapeared multiple times, making me believe the game had crashed until i figured out that my mouse pointer was invisible. Worse of all by far was the night vision glitch, made my game unplayable at night 10's hours trying to play Deino, and all i could see at night was a black screen so I just sat and starved or got killed by other Deinos who werent getting the glitch at the time. This is a completely game breaking bug that's been posted about for like a year and nothings been done yet. \n\nConclusion: This is a game just like DayZ, where its much more enjoyable to watch someone else play it because they edit out the hours of nothingness, it doesn't respect your time whatsoever. You can spend 6 hours growing your dino just lose all your progress to bugs and glitches server restarts ect. If you are a fan of non modded Dayz, and want a similar survival experience but with Dino's you may enjoy this. But for me the bugs glitches, and sheer amount of time spent doing  nothing, make this a hard pass.", "timestamp_created": 1736022649, "timestamp_updated": 1736022649, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184771121": {"recommendationid": "184771121", "author": {"steamid": "76561199508930592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1149, "playtime_at_review": 19673, "last_played": 1737349920}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will be good someday trust.

Man betritt dem offiziellen Server und bekommt keine Einf\u00fchrung oder Tutorial. Jeder Dino hat spezielle Attacken oder sogar spezielle F\u00e4higkeiten. Es gibt viele Mechanismen, die man benutzen kann und alles, was das Game dir sagt, ist \"E to drink\" oder \"E to eat\" oder \"G to grab\".\nDas ist sehr frustrierend.\n\nNachdem ich die ersten H\u00fcrden des Spiels \u00fcberwunden hatte und mir einige Informationen aus dem Internet besorgt hatte, um das Spiel wirklich spielen zu k\u00f6nnen, bin ich in die n\u00e4chste Falle des Spiels getappt. Als Fleischfresser bin ich h\u00e4ufiger verhungert als durch alle anderen Todesarten zusammen. Das Problem ist, dass ich bis heute nicht herausgefunden habe, wie ich besser an Ki-Futter kommen kann. Aber ich habe gemerkt, dass man sich in diesem Spiel auf seine Ohren und seinen Geruchssinn verlassen muss, um ein Ziel zu finden und zu verfolgen.\n\nAm Ende habe ich jetzt viele Informationen \u00fcber das Game und verstehe sowohl die Dinosaurier als auch die Spielmechanik viel besser. Das Game macht mir sehr viel Spa\u00df und ich hatte bis jetzt auch viele sch\u00f6ne Erlebnisse.\n\nWas ich jedem neuen Spieler raten w\u00fcrde, ist sich Informationen \u00fcber das Game zu besorgen.\nHier ist meine Liste f\u00fcr Leute, die Englisch k\u00f6nnen.

Du musst jede Entscheidung die du triffst mit dem Gedanken \"Kann ich das \u00fcberleben?\" treffen. Man lernt viele Leute kennen und macht mit ihnen gute und nat\u00fcrlich auch schlechte Erfahrungen.\n\nW\u00fcnsche\nBitte lasst die Dinos mehr wiegen (nicht im Spiel als Stat, sondern in der Physik), denn wenn man als Dino \u00fcber eine kleine Vertiefung im Boden l\u00e4uft, fliegt man direkt weg.\n\nUnter anderem w\u00fcrde ich vorschlagen, dass man Open Breeding machen kann, so dass man auch ohne Nestcode beitreten kann, wenn man will.", "timestamp_created": 1735995736, "timestamp_updated": 1737225287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184735837": {"recommendationid": "184735837", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467051943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1736000144}, "language": "english", "review": "good game remember to switch to the right version", "timestamp_created": 1735995614, "timestamp_updated": 1735995614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184734489": {"recommendationid": "184734489", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021089200", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 127016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3611, "playtime_at_review": 122709, "last_played": 1737414524}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to get addicted to a dinosaur game and cry after you lose hours of your life to a crocodile, be my guest", "timestamp_created": 1735994452, "timestamp_updated": 1735994452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184734071": {"recommendationid": "184734071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175229679", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1736185306}, "language": "english", "review": "hold E to drink.\nDies of dehydration in water while 'drinking'\n\ngreat game-play loop of doing nothing until you die of starvation of dehydration. haven't even seen any other animals or dinos", "timestamp_created": 1735994097, "timestamp_updated": 1735994097, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184732118": {"recommendationid": "184732118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131302073", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18815, "last_played": 1735922397}, "language": "english", "review": "The Isle is undoubtedly the best hardcore, realistic dinosaur sim game out there!

and off for years now. When there's new things, I'll pop in and play it hard for a few weeks then pause until the next batch of new stuff or I get a random urge to play again. So I feel I can speak with some level of experience on the current quality and overall development cycle. As a preface, I'll say this: I love The Isle. I always have and I always will. My critique and frustration come from a place of love and wanting to see it thrive and grow into the game I know it can be. \n\nAs a note, I'm reviewing the Evrima build specifically which is accessible by selecting it under betas in the preferences. Evrima is the only build the devs are currently working on as far as I know. The old build (the one that installs by default) is very outdated and essentially abandoned by the few devs they have. Evrima is also far better, despite having less playable dinosaurs. \n\nThe game is very much a love/hate relationship. The ecosystem simulator aspect is very unique and superbly done. The additions they've made for migration zones, patrol zones, scent systems, mutations, and various dino ecological niches are VERY good and show the game is very slowly moving in the right direction. The dinosaur designs are superb and the realism is unmatched when it comes to the Gateway map, locomotion, animations, sounds, you name it. Heck even the plant life and ambient noises in various locations are supremely immersive. It all combines to make The Isle Evrima a truly rare jewel in these types of open world survival games. \n\nThat being said... It has problems. And a lot of them. So many in fact that even someone who adores the game has trouble ignoring them. (To the point of making a long winded diatribe about it on a public review page, apparently.) The development cycle is astonishingly slow, even for a small team. You can report game breaking bugs, but it may take literal years for them to even be acknowledged let alone addressed. They've gotten better at this, but the track record is rough and hard to overlook. \n\nThe servers in Evrima are my main issue at the moment. Realistically, the Official servers are the only ones anyone plays on as the non official ones tend to be empty, insta-grow death match PVP servers, or too high ping for people to be able to do anything on. The queue times are absurd just to get into the Official servers as there's not enough of them for the current active player count. Unless you sneak in right after server reset (I set timers on my phone for them just so I can spam refresh and maybe actually play the game) or play super late night/early morning in the timezone for that server, you can expect 50-60 person queues. Or more. And since people know these queues are absurdly long, they tend to not leave the server once in. So you might sit in a queue for over and hour. Or hours plural. Not to mention there's currently a major issue where you'll get randomly disconnected from queue for no apparent reason or explanation. So you can sit in line for an hour, get to #1 in line, then DC right before you get in. Then have it happen AGAIN on another server. \n\nHackers are absolutely everywhere. Admins try to keep up with removing them, but it's still very commonplace to spend hours growing something big only for all that progress to be completely destroyed by a hacker that kills you in seconds. It's why I stick to small fast grow time dinos now, so when something inevitably kills me out of nowhere I'm not too upset. \n\nThere's major balance issues with dinos, buggy animations, and the PVP (which is required for some dinos to have a reasonable chance at surviving) tends to be a buggy ping-dependent mess of rubber banding and broken hit registration. Dinos you hit and hear make the pain noise won't have actually taken damage, and people can kill you sometimes by biting several body lengths away from you. And it's sometimes impossible to tell if it's the server, or if it was a hacker. \n\nI could go on and on but I'm nearly at the end of my queue to get in and play my Beipi. Fingers crossed it doesn't DC me right at the end for a THIRD time tonight. \n\nTL;DR: Game's amazing when it works. Beautiful. Fun. Lots of memorable random interactions with other players. But holy heck do you need the patience of a saint to get past the frustration of broken stuff and servers that I assume are powered by a drunk Dibble on a treadmill. Enjoy at your own risk. Maybe 2025 will finally be our year. (If I repeat that every year, I'll eventually be right.)", "timestamp_created": 1735942777, "timestamp_updated": 1735942777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530386745929718018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184683769": {"recommendationid": "184683769", "author": {"steamid": "76561199426356883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "playtime_at_review": 592, "last_played": 1736967775}, "language": "swedish", "review": "a very good game a lots of fun moments", "timestamp_created": 1735942745, "timestamp_updated": 1735942745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184682737": {"recommendationid": "184682737", "author": {"steamid": "76561199265761110", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1735941077}, "language": "english", "review": "I was excited to play this game after playing on a friends computer.

Played Legacy first not knowing about the Beta \"Evrima\". Legacy seems more direct, get in, track dinos, kill each other, more like a pvp sandbox.\nThen ran into a huge group of Carnos, and joined them, they told me and my friends about Evirma, said they didn't like it because unlike Legacy, you couldn't just team up and find ur friends instantly, you had to go find them on a map that's 225 square kilometers, Ark Survival is 48 square kilometers for reference!\nBut I wanted to give it a go, so we tried it, and I enjoy the Beta sooo much more, so everyone has a personal preference. Also there's more Dinos you can play in Evirma, for example the Pteranodon, which if you play for a couple hours, the map starts to make sense, and its easy to learn.\nI enjoyed tho flying around the map, I ran into a couple other Pteranodons on my journey. We emoted to each other that we were friendly, and joined a team together, went scavenging and hunting, then get to a watering hole and a raptor kills us all. Just a fair warning, you will die constantly, more often from starvation than dinos if your a carnivore that is, until you get better at the game, and figure out where to find Dinos and where they tend to congregate (it's watering holes). Once you learn the map, and where all the fresh water is, it becomes much more enjoyable.\nDefinitely plays more like a Dino Royale.. load in as a Dino.. spend an hour or a few growing and surviving, then randomly get chomped and lose all ur progress. Its more for the experience of each play through, so if you don't like hardcore modes in games, or dying and losing everything often, this game isn't for you. I've tried official and modded servers, and have really enjoyed the modded not cuz they were much different, but a little more rules and role play (i.e. same breed dinos cant kill each other, etc.) made the game more interesting. If you just wanna join in with a bunch of friends and kill other Dinos, then Legacy is more fun, but playing solo I have to recommend the Evrima Beta, also the \"Herrerasaurus\" is the most fun solo Dino for me, cuz he can climb up trees to escape predators, or jump down on even larger prey than himself.\nMy buddy bought me the game for Christmas to play with him, so it was free, but it was on sale at the time for $13 and I definitely would recommend it on sale.\nEven for full price of $20 for a game that seems to have a massive massive community, and still actively being worked on, I'd feel safe buying it at full price even.\n\nCombat: Could be a lil better, but definitely get different attacks/experiences with different Dinos\n\nMusic: very well done, music is awesome and immersive.\n\nCommunity: very cool, as many people as have ate me, there's been even more that have spared me or just had good vibes with, repeatedly hopping or crouching may to show ur friendly may save ur life xD\n\nExploration: definitely one of the largest game maps ive ever seen. with 225 square kilometers it absolutely dwarfs games like Ark, however there seems to be less monuments, or watering holes, or things that really stand out than I'd expect for a map being so big, which seems to then limit the actual functional/usable space of the map. And a new player might traverse 60% of the map and never find anyone cuz hes not looking in the areas that would be functionable, however if they eventually could have 2k players on a server vs 100-300, the space would be very cool for a singular type of server like that..\n\nOverall I'd give the game an 80% or greater rating, and would recommend to anyone who wants something a lil different, whether its a small story with some new encounters/friends, or just running off and exploring the map.", "timestamp_created": 1735930655, "timestamp_updated": 1735930655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184667774": {"recommendationid": "184667774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085920481", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1118, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1737400654}, "language": "english", "review": "The game doesn't respect your time.

First, the elephant in the room. This game has been in early access for almost TEN YEARS. Happy 10 year early accessaversary everyone! New and current version of the game (evrima) made some nice changes but at the detriment of its roster. No T-Rex? Seriously? In a dinosaur videogame? There are currently no large carnivores to deal with the very strong Steggo, When i play as a steggo the only way Id die once full grown is if some carnivore mega pack finds me or I get so bored I find a cliff to jump off of to die and play something else. Also top choice in some of these dinos for real. Who the fuck even plays the Dryosaurus or the Hypsilophodon? I played the Hypsi ONCE and everyone i bumped into (aside from the common dickhead dilo) was so shocked to even SEE one that they would gather around me and just marvel at the fact that some loser actually picked the thing. Its buggier than a hoarders trash pile and like every dino game you will ramp off every minor obstacle and die to fall damage. More than half my deaths overall in this game are because my toe hit a stick and now I'm Michael fucking Jordan jumping up to pose for Nike and my 2 ton lizard comes crumbling to the earth. 10 years and this shit still doesnt work.

Playing it was not only miserable, but I have never been unhappier with myself then my dinosaur died to something unavoidable- a bug in the terrain, a hill obscured by copious amounts of copy-paste foliage, starvation because the poorly designed map contains no landmarks and no tutorial, and you are expected to run another tab to copy and paste your coordinates into every five minutes. Five minutes you often do not have - not between starving to death and the other players.\n\nI, myself, due to avoiding officials have never had a particularly bad experience with other players.

The island is way to big for beginners to get started with no sense of direction. Players that have been here for a while use interactive maps online to navigate.\n\n2. The a.i. system is bad. This should be at the top of the list for devs. If new players are lost in the jungle with no map + starving every time they play a carnivore they are going to quit. \n\n3. IMPORTANT.    There needs to be an immediate fix (even if the feature is not kept) to nesting. THERE HAS TO BE AN INCENTIVE for players to nest.  After nesting a certain amount of babies you should get a free mutation point or something. We would keep SOOOOOO many new players if their first experience was a parent teaching them how to play.. where to drink, find plants to eat or hunt..... right now nesting makes the game harder for no benefit, Barely anyone uses the feature\n \n4.

Ignoring all other discussions of bugs, AI spawning, and species pros and cons, there is nothing to this game. All you do is travel and eat until you die. You don't die? Congrats! You're reward is you walk for hours. That is the entire game.\r\n\r\nI was super hyped about this game because from let's play's I saw online (faulty sources, I know) it seemed like a game that required a decent amount of strategy, learning, and you are constantly on a knife's edge of risk v reward. Kill or no? Wait to heal, or keep going? Run or hide? But the actual gameplay usually is either absolutely nothing happening FOR HOURS or insta death from off screen, dropping off a cliff you COULD NOT SEE, or straight up starving to death. You do not sense any other living creatures unless you are already on top of them. By then you are already lost or won. The entire sense of knife's edge risk v reward doesn't exist because YOU CANNOT PERCEIVE EITHER RISK OR REWARD! \r\n\r\nMost of my game play has been horrendous because it takes SO LONG to get big, so my perspective of the world is crotch shot foliage. If any plants are about 12\" tall in front of/on top of me I have NO visibility. Food exists but it is so damn hard to locate. It takes a lot of walking and HOPING you will get close enough to sniff it out. Many carnivores camp at Meat Spawns to lure other prey. Cool, valid tactic, but food is so rare that you don't often have the choice to skip eating for a safer bet later, you are dying from starvation NOW. Also when you are small, you cannot even SEE the food until you are on top of it, so you aren't likely able to scope it out before swooping in.\r\n\r\nThe game has SO much potential, but there is so much of this game that feels like getting sucker punched. I am familiar with games that require you to figure it out, but when I cannot see/hear/find anything until it is too late, I am not learning.

Ele \u00e9 visualmente muito bonito e oferece mais op\u00e7\u00f5es de dinossauros.\r\n Por\u00e9m, possui algumas desvantagens:\r\n\r\nJogando como herb\u00edvoro: \u00c9 essencial andar em bando, o que pode ser dif\u00edcil, j\u00e1 que o jogo n\u00e3o oferece ferramentas para localizar outros jogadores da mesma esp\u00e9cie. Voc\u00ea precisa se arriscar bastante para encontrar aliados, correndo o risco de ser morto por predadores no caminho.\r\n\r\nJogando como carn\u00edvoro ou on\u00edvoro: Voc\u00ea pode ca\u00e7ar outros jogadores ou bots. No entanto, os bots s\u00e3o praticamente in\u00fateis, pois o mapa \u00e9 enorme e encontr\u00e1-los \u00e9 raro.\r\n\r\nIntera\u00e7\u00e3o limitada: O chat \u00e9 apenas local, o que complica bastante a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de grupos, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como saber onde est\u00e3o outros jogadores da sua esp\u00e9cie no mapa. (isso \u00e9 uma desvantagem, os \u00fanicos que s\u00e3o f\u00e1ceis de formar duo \u00e9 Deinos, pois nascem na \u00e1gua.)\r\n\r\nProblemas t\u00e9cnicos:\r\n\r\nA vis\u00e3o noturna do Deinosuchus (crocodilo) \u00e9 p\u00e9ssima. Al\u00e9m disso, h\u00e1 um bug em que tudo parece claro no lago e, de repente, fica escuro como um \"limbo\". N\u00e3o sei se \u00e9 intencional, mas seria algo que a equipe deveria corrigir.\r\n\r\nExperi\u00eancia em servidores brasileiros:\r\n\r\nO \u00fanico servidor BR do Evrima que joguei foi t\u00f3xico. Muitos jogadores matavam sem motivo. Por exemplo, se voc\u00ea \u00e9 um filhote e se aproxima de uma carca\u00e7a com muita comida dispon\u00edvel, a tend\u00eancia seria poder comer, mas geralmente eles simplesmente te matam. Tentar socializar \u00e9 quase imposs\u00edvel.\r\nPor outro lado, os servidores gringos s\u00e3o melhores para iniciantes. Recomendo procurar um servidor com ovos dispon\u00edveis, para voc\u00ea nascer em uma fam\u00edlia e aprender a jogar.\r\n\r\nSobre The Isle Legendary (primeira vers\u00e3o):\r\n\r\nA vis\u00e3o noturna \u00e9 ainda pior: voc\u00ea s\u00f3 v\u00ea em preto e branco, e com um alcance limitado.\r\n\u00c9 mais f\u00e1cil encontrar servidores BR cheios, mas, como no Evrima, \u00e9 dif\u00edcil formar grupos ou bando.\r\n\r\nConclus\u00e3o:\r\nN\u00e3o recomendo jogar The Isle Legendary no momento. J\u00e1 o Evrima tem potencial, mas a experi\u00eancia depende muito de encontrar o servidor certo e superar os problemas mencionados.\r\n\r\nMinha avalia\u00e7\u00e3o permanece negativa at\u00e9 que mudan\u00e7as sejam feitas.", "timestamp_created": 1735662551, "timestamp_updated": 1735662551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184340878": {"recommendationid": "184340878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962896043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 144, "playtime_at_review": 3795, "last_played": 1736443841}, "language": "english", "review": "Spawn\r\n\r\nSniff\r\n\r\nRun\r\n\r\nEat \r\n\r\nRepeat\r\n\r\nOptional: Hunt, Die.\r\n\r\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1735660729, "timestamp_updated": 1735660729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184340271": {"recommendationid": "184340271", "author": {"steamid": "76561199803323513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1736196086}, "language": "english", "review": "went as a giga found another group of gigas we became friends gigas betrayed :( 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1735660343, "timestamp_updated": 1735660343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184339705": {"recommendationid": "184339705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010789305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1735621281}, "language": "english", "review": "What a mess.

Really cool concept. Don't play carnivore unless you have a group. Its pointless and not very much fun starving to death only to realize its pointless to solo as carnivore anyway; except the crocodile, but also pointless as croc. Actually, carnivore play is just really bad all around. Needs more AI so you don't just run around and starve as much; or be expected to take down an adult as a baby when the thing was always gonna be too big for your dino. Don't play carnivore unless you have cheats or some major advantage. Only play carnivore if you're cheating.\n\nIts slightly less pointless to play as herbivore; unless you also have a group on discord then its kinda ok.. Play something that runs fast, everything else needs group. \n\nHands down, most fun is omnivore for solo play, since you're avoiding everyone anyway. Duck is fun.\n\nEDIT: The game stopped being fun. Mostly because it isn't fun to play any of the dinosaurs except the thing thats basically a duck, and that gets boring fast. The crocodile is fun if you manage to get to adult, kind of. But more fun to be duck and dodge crocs. \n\nMy experience with carnivore is starving to death usually before you get past being a baby. Rename to scavenger and fix this game. LOL! Add a suicide button also. Waiting to starve is obnoxious and trying to fast swim your stamina away to drown is depressing. \n\nHerbivore is boring unless  you have group and carnivores to fight. They usually starve and have no hope of keeping up with your growth rate. Boring though.\n\nOnly omnivore is fun currently, and then its only the duck. Add more AI for starting carnivore or add suicide button and rename to scavenger. \n\nAs others have said, carnivores only prey on other carnivores save maybe the croc. If some more of the other dinosaurs were viable... maybe more omnivore classes for carnivores to prey on, it might even out some.\n\nIsn't really cohesive and has been in early access or something for 10 years. \n\nCould be a lot of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1735570147, "timestamp_updated": 1736121896, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count":

Secondly this game is great fun with friends and strangers, the community is excellent.\n\nBUT, here is why I have to give a negative review and this will change based on updates. Currently the world mechanics are absolutely broken as a carnivore. As a herbivore you have the ability to graze, you can eat grass anywhere to keep your hunger a 25% and stave away death via starvation. As a carnivore there are SUPPOSED to be similar means of survival, small animals, fish, crustaceans etc. As of my time of writing this these small creatures are broken. \n\nOf my 29 hours I have had one single 2 hour run where I was able to find land animals as food playing a carnivore. The rest of my time spent playing these dinos has been a starving simulator. Pterodons are particularly broken, when skimming fish from a lake, you will be chased and hurt as well as having your fish stolen by npc bird dinos, so next option is to head to the coast. Turtles and Crabs simply do not spawn, in my 29 hours of play I have not see a SINGLE crab or turtle. I think they are a myth. \n\nThis game is beautiful, this game is addictive, this game is unique. But like an ecosystem it means to emulate, it requires balance, currently that balance is askew and leading to a very lopsided experience unless you want to eat vegetation.\n\nAlso apparently you used to be able to pick your spawn, that would be handy considering alot of biomes are infact extra broken due to the above mentioned issue.\n\n\nUpdate: They have fixed the ai, the game is now functioning excellently for carnivors & I have updated my review from negative to positive.

I have decided that it isn't a good game at all. In fact I'd argue it's being marketed very poorly by the online community making media on it. The youtube videos show you a fun and exciting adventure everytime you boot up the game and join a server. They don't mention the fact that ever official server (legacy and Evrima) have mix-mega packs that kill everything they see, the absurdly long times it takes to grow basically anything, or the fact this game (like most other survival games) is really only fun when you've either A. Dedicated your life to learning all the little details and exploits. or B. Get a few friends together and grow as a pack to become the assholes killing everything on sight.\n\nLots of people in the community will then say, \"Go play unofficial\" truth is they have even larger problems than official does most of the time. Either have odd ass rules, super fast grow speeds meaning it's just a PvP simulator, or the fact that no one is actually playing, they're all just afk growing.\n\nSo no, I don't recommend this game. I'm just planning on logging another 4-ish hours to get my moneys worth out of it, then putting it aside until the devs decide to stop being little shitheads about the game being brutally hard for the tiny niche pvp centered survival community.

tech demo.\nIl gioco capisco benissimo sia in beta (da 5 anni eh mica 2) ma non si pu\u00f2 morire cos\u00ec spesso a causa di mancanza di cibo.\nTrovare cibo da soli da piccoli \u00e8 impossibile specialmente se si gioca su server con 0 ai, dove o trovi un membro della tua specie adulti che procaccia per te o sei fregato.\nSui server con L'AI di animali invece immagino ci sia un bug di gioco, \u00e8 rarissimo quanto trovare oro scavando una buca in spiaggia, non ha senso che ci siano cos\u00ec pochi animali su una cazzo di isola sperduta con i dinosauri.\nIl gioco anche una volta superati questi limiti e diventi a nostra volta adulti finisce cos\u00ec.\nSi sopravvive e ci si mena, un peccato poich\u00e8 il gameplay loop finisce cos\u00ec, non stimolando nessun giocatore all'esplorazione (poich\u00e8 uscendo dalle area popolose si trova sicuramente 0 cibo).\nLa mappa \u00e8 davvero DAVVERO troppo grande, ci si perde e non capisco davvero il perch\u00e8 abbiano deciso di farla cos\u00ec grande per 110 persone attive sul server, praticamente sar\u00e0 gi\u00e0 tanto incontrarne 6 o 7 se non si gruppa con il proprio branco, il gioco purtroppo soffre anche di un problema di bilanciamento molto grave, al momento ci sono erbivori troppo forti e grossi che oneshottano praticamente tutto una volta diventati adulti, cosa facile poich\u00e8 non possono morire di fame.\nI carnivori si cacciano tra loro se non qualche piccolo coraggioso che decide invece di affrontare gli stegosauri e morire da guerriero nell'impresa.\nInoltre segnalo che ci sono persone che camperano fuori dai santuari (aree predilette dai cuccioli per crescere al sicuro, spoiler non avviene per nulla) oneshottando tutti i giocatori appena spawnati se non addirittura invadendo queste zone sicure facendo quello che vogliono (cosa che mi \u00e8 capitato pi\u00f9 volte).\nQuindi \n- TONNELLATE DI BUG\n- PESANTE DA GIRARE FLUIDAMENTE\n- GAMEPLAY ROTTO COME POCHE COSE AL MONDO\n- BUG \n- I CARNIVORI SI CANNIBALIZZANO PERCHE' GLI ERBIVORI SONO TROPPO FORTI\n\nE' davvero un peccato perch\u00e8 le animazioni e la grafica sono incredibile ma l'esperienza risulta troppo frustrante poich\u00e8  si muore per davvero delle cazzate e tra l'altro in maniera poco divertente.\nNon ha senso attualmente dare 20 euro per questo gioco, aspettate un annetto in modo tale che sistemino ste robe e aggiungano carnivori grossi come Allosauro e Trex", "timestamp_created": 1735317873, "timestamp_updated": 1735317873, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

game (the current Evrima Gateway version) is not for the inexperienced gamer just wanting to be a dinosaur and RP. There is no tutorial, there are very few hints, and yes - it is early access. It has a VERY steep learning curve, which is where most of the negative comments come from. However, unlike most early access games, navigating the learning curve is extremely rewarding. \n\nThe Isle is in constant active development (and has been for many years), but not like other games where an unpolished game is released in early access for a quick buck and then becoming abandon-ware. Playing this game means joining the official discord, watching videos, dying over and over and over again to learn the game. Yes, it's punishing, yes it feels way too difficult when you first start. But if you are an avid gamer, GIVE THE ISLE A REAL CHANCE. This indie development team is interactive with their community, they answer questions in the their discord, they spoonfeed spoilers on upcoming updates, they take community feedback into consideration, and they launch all patches/updates on 'hordetesting' servers first, allowing their own playerbase to CHOOSE to interact with possibly buggy content in order to both help the devs test and squash bugs, while also giving the player a chance to experience new content before it gets released on official servers (at no additional charge.)\n\nAnd again, this game is HARD to learn, but this is one of very few games where learning how to play is extremely rewarding and well worth it. It's very difficult to make a game containing prehistoric animal life realistic while still making for an immersive and fun pvp experience. The Isle nails that, and a lot of players don't get a chance to experience the true depth of this game due to their impatience to learn. \n\nGateway is a HUGE map with a player cap of 100-120 players depending on the server. You spawn in a random location depending on your species, and your goal is to survive. You're not just going to run around and find food as a carnivore... you have to HUNT it. And you have to do it the right way. Each species has their own mutations, some of which are obtained by hidden achievements (that they don't just tell you how to get... it's discovered by the community and shared) and while these mutations may seem to have miniscule effects, they vastly effect your gameplay and combat strategy. Manging your food, water, diets (given by killing specific species that are on your creature's \"diet\") and surviving fights. You have to learn EACH species you play, and learning is never going to be easy. Every species has unique traits, attacks, strengths, weaknesses etc. \n\nFor instance, an omniraptor can pounce onto its prey, inflicting a bleed. This bleed increases the rate at which the prey dies the more they panic and run. Multiple omnis can increase the rate at which its prey bleeds. If your prey is smaller than you, such as a troodon or small galli - you can pin it and kill it in one blow with a well-timed and well aimed pounce. If your prey is larger, a single omni cannot pin it. HOWEVER, if you have a pack and several of you are fighting the same prey (lets use a full grown maia for example), which is much larger than you - you are able to force it to consume stamina while fighting you, and once its stamina drains to a certain threshold, your pack can team up and pounce together allowing several of you to pin it down despite its greater size. \n\nAnd no, there's no HP bars, your health is indicated by the level of blood around your screen. You cannot see enemy health, only wounds on their body. Your stamina drains and is consumed quicker the older you get, so its important to manage it and learn when to use it and when to save it. You cannot see enemy stamina, either. You have to keep track of how much stamina they consume while fighting you or running from you. Listen for them to start breathing heavier, indicating they've fallen below half. Use pack hunting to your advantage - communicate with your pack when you are low, need a break, are injured, can no longer fight. And listen to their communications and use that information to judge whether its worth continuing a fight or not.\n\nThis game is ultimately about survival, not kills. There's no leaderboards, competition, chatting with other species in-game. You have to learn the map, learn each species and their abilities and affects and in what situations they are most useful and what species they are most effective against. And just when you've started to grasp all of these things, there's an update. A new dino release, minor balance adjustments, minor ability changes to make sure every existing creature still works with the new addition. This isn't a \"run up to another dino and chomp until it dies\" kind of game. But learning it and improving your skill at each species makes it a TON of fun. \n\nJoin the discord, find other people to play with and help you learn. It's 100% worth it. This game is an absolute diamond that is only going to get more and more polished with time. It doesn't need to come out of early access, because playing it in early access is part of the reward - you get to help shape this game.\n\nIf you're looking for an easy RP experience, play the legacy version which is no longer updated but has a lot more species and is much easier to learn (but has far less depth.) Give this game a chance and be patient with it, ask questions in the discord, watch videos, take your time. Try not to get too frustrated with dying... because it will happen A LOT. All the time. Every day. But each death will teach you something. \n\nDo not play without a headset, directional sound is an absolute must. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading, hope this helps!", "timestamp_created": 1735252591, "timestamp_updated": 1735252591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183800071": {"recommendationid": "183800071", "author": {"steamid": "76561199370331584", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1736589051}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game. could do with easier finding of things to eat. i cant find a damn fish anywhere", "timestamp_created": 1735251803, "timestamp_updated": 1735251803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183798646": {"recommendationid": "183798646", "author": {"steamid": "76561199811350036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1736475034}, "language": "english", "review": "I HAVE GOT EVRIMA AND EVRY TIME I TRY TO JOIN A SEVREVER MY GAME CHRASHES PLEASE RESPOND AND HAVE A RESONE FOR THIS.

for 2 hours to find one rabbit that when I eat it I have two more minutes of life... you ruined the game by removing the spawn point... Now you can play as a herbivore, but as a carnivore you are doomed, either you will die of hunger or you will die of a herbivore that has reached adulthood!! I played before when there was a spawn point and it was pretty good... after a while there were crash report bugs that kicked you out of the game and you became someone's breakfast. because of those crashes, I stopped playing and now I find out that they finally fixed it so that I would log into the game and see that now there is an even worse, even bigger problem.... I don't like playing herbivores because they are boring, I like playing omniraptors... . today I did 11 hours as an omniraptor... so horror and terror are pure... I never got to subadult... in this 11 hours of playin I found a fucking rabbit that extended my life by about 10 minutes... in 11 hours, I crossed all but all the sanctuaries and found 2 pachys who of course beat me like a little monkey... you ruined all the fun from this game! I played croco for about 2 hours... and it became retardedly boring... I crossed the entire swamp and river 2 to 3 times and in that period I only killed crocs because of course there are also safe places to drink water, which is ok but it's so boring for crocodiles! I wanted to throw myself out the window after all this... you had a great game that just needed to be polished a little better and instead of polishing it you throw it in the mud...

They put way too much focus and effort into creating multiple skin designs and polishing up pots and pans that sit on stoves in a building made in theory for a human-playable character that has never been even close to being started on and it will continue that way for several more years until they go bankrupt.\n\nThey've made many improvments to the second version of the game, and many parts are lacking from the first. However, their glacial game content devlopment speed, terrible behavior by the Fuhrer in charge, kitten, who has and had a long history of being the type of person who is incredibly hateful and rude to anyone that disagrees with anything she says, and then turns around and acts like peace-to-all type individual.\n\nNot to try and single that specific person out, but it highlights issues on why this game has taken such a massive hit and continues. They started the downfall with a rugpull, telling everyone that they were going to be completely remaking the game. Then, came a pretty shitty start to development and transparency on progress. Then, a rather unfortunate PR hit when a dev was alleged to be involved in sexually explicit actions with minors. Then, the DEI program rolled in and completely ruined the image of the company with terrible communication and goals, coupled with that freak Dondi flexing all the money he made on the initial hype of the game, only to slowly, and then completely disappear from involvement with the game or team at all.\n\nIn short, this game is not what it used to be, that had a really fantastic community of players.\nIt's been reduced into a glacially moving hobby-project of a solo walking simulator.\n\nMy advice, ask the players what they want, and do what they want.\nNobody wants to play a game where you have to choose between 8 small dinosaurs and run around in a terribly optimized world, alone, because there is no longer a great interest in this game due to the glaringly obvious sentiment that the devs do not care what the players and customers think.", "timestamp_created": 1735120412, "timestamp_updated": 1735120412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0,

"review": "This review is more on a middle level between \"good and bad\" and formed from my experience within this game and if I may have some information wrong out dated at the time of writting this, I\u00b4m more than open for corrections.\r\n\r\nShort, would I recommend the isle (evrima) to new players? Not at its current state really. \r\n\r\nSimply because at its current state, it is conflicting to play and for a new beginner it may take a good couple hours of play time to understand what\u00b4s going on or getting on others players to help you. Now i have nothing against games that work more on \"earned experience\" as The isle does in my eyes BUT there needs to be a clear tutorial for new people with in this game again. The old version, \"legacy\", had some tutorial pop ups within the game , but Evrima, the current new recoded version, still lacks this after the past couple of years its open to the public. That\u00b4s a problem as it introduces a couple new combat mechanics, hunting ways (fishing) and  a diet system as well as some other enviromental things like mud pits. \r\nIf I were a new player I\u00b4d get overwhelemd with all of this and no explanation with it all, some things may be clear from trial and error and reading the dinosaurs Bio, but in my eyes theres just alot for new folks to learn with no explanation what so ever. \r\n\r\nThe games performance is also something that could still be improved, when evrima first released alot of people with decent build pc\u00b4s would suffer under low fps even with their PS3 graphics already turned down . now a days it\u00b4s gotten a little better, but the game still experience horrible FPS drops due to simply players in one direction, or dense, horrible optomized fauna. \r\n\r\nThe game can be pretty if you have a good pc build, but I catch myself fiddling with it to this day just so i dont get fps drops that just go to 17-20fps only because I LOOKED into the direction of possible players miles away. \r\n\r\nThe game has nice visuals and for the most part pretty dinosaur designs and great animations and feelings to the creatures, but that\u00b4s one of the only reasons why i still play this game at its current state. The movement is fun for the most dinosaurs in this game and I like it alot, no other game in the genre really does this right now (dinosaur survival specific) . But the game needs alot of work still.\r\nTheres alot of imbalance within the playable rooster, you can choose between: \r\n\r\ncarni: either hunt other carnis, mega pack to kill herbis herds or try desperatly finding AI (even if that has been slighly improved at the time of writting this) \r\n\r\nherbi: eat almost everything, walking from place to place or try to figure out these coastral migration zones \r\n\r\nOmnivores: Wanna be fast? galli, eat alot of things. wanna be a nice semi aquatic which stamina and water speed has been drastically nerfed so the main predator, deinosuchus , can now easily catch you even with a mutation for your speed? Beipi. \r\n\r\nThe balancing is a joke and desperatly needs more attention and the developers NEED to listen to players more. You cannot just do something and just P+ss off most of the community with the drastic and unfair balances to the creatures. Not to mention that the carnis to this day dont have a good and decent apex predator (on land) to compete with the herbi rooster. \r\n\r\nEvrima gave us stuff to do, take care of diets but besides that its still the old sit around try to find food and just kill other players because theres not much else that gets players to interact with the world. Nesting is an option but how its handled with the lack of a proper global chat is still very lose and not worth it for the most part UNLESS you are in a The isle discord to advert your egg code to get people into your nest. Theres literally not much to do . I dont want the survival to have quests and I realize that natural survival can be boring, but if i sit on my creature only trying to find food and growing it for literal hours on end, i want more than just eventual PVP for enjoyment. Not to mention there has been herbi mega packs to just go around smacking all over players. nothing the devs take respondsibility for but theres not mucht he carnivore rooster can do for most of the herbis.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good pc and you can deal with unbalanced gameplay, go for it but id advice to wait ages more for this game to get its stuff together and finally listen to players and add what we actually need in this game.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735089015, "timestamp_updated": 1735089015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183610876": {"recommendationid": "183610876", "author": {"steamid": "76561199589224296", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 352, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1737414690}, "language": "english", "review": "w game", "timestamp_created": 1735088357, "timestamp_updated": 1735088357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183604955": {"recommendationid": "183604955", "author": {"steamid": "76561199810088329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5020, "playtime_at_review": 4051, "last_played": 1737396702}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "incrivel super realista eu super recomendo", "timestamp_created": 1735081127, "timestamp_updated": 1735081127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183603425": {"recommendationid": "183603425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449276655", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 114, "playtime_at_review": 3493, "last_played": 1736592153}, "language": "turkish", "review": "k\u00f6t\u00fc fizik ve optimizasyon", "timestamp_created": 1735079536, "timestamp_updated": 1735079536, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525987505912780762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183599201": {"recommendationid": "183599201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002766770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 6598, "last_played": 1737152652}, "language": "polish", "review": "z pe\u0142nym brzuchem lata\u0142em po ca\u0142ej mapie i \u017cywego ducha nie spotka\u0142em, umar\u0142em z g\u0142odu.
