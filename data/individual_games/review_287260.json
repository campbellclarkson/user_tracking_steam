However there isn't that much to it - six hours in and I've already at least one starred everything apart from the frustratingly difficult final race that perhaps made up 25% of my play time.  Set on kitchen tables the game re-utilises lots of assets so some of the 35 tracks feel very familiar.  The system for buying new vehicles is fun and providing you rerun events where you've only one or two starred the map you're never short of money to buy them.\n\nI can't find this game is my purchase history so it as probably something that I bought for under \u00a35.00 in a sale ages ago and has then lingered unplayed until I loaded it up a few days ago.  The problem with a top down racer is that your view of the road ahead is very limited so success may depend on being able to memorise the courses.  The game goes from reasonably easy at the start to being positively punitive in cups 6 and 7 with any mistakes certainly taking away .the chance of a three star score.\n\nIt should be viewed as a pocket money game - bought for a few quid, played for a handful of hours, and then probably forgotten unless you've got closely matched friends to play against.  I wouldn't recommend it at full price.\n\nS.x.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736594975, "timestamp_updated": 1736594975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184427849": {"recommendationid": "184427849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390544510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1735909634}, "language": "english", "review": "Good maps.
