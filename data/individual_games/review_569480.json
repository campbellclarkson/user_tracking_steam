Here are a couple exploits that made the game unplayable for me:\r\n\r\nThe most important and impactful exploit that tipped me over from a \"yes\" to a \"no\" on the recommendation:\r\nFilling in the entire outer perimeter of the shallow water with piers and any wall, making sure as to not having a single tile of shallow ocean accessible from the outside, makes it impossible for vikings to even try to land on your island. The most they can do is throw stones, which is hardly a problem, leaving dragons as the only possible threat. Dragons of course never really being a threat to end your run. That role is supposed to be filled by the vikings which are now irrelevant.\r\n\r\nBeing at war with one person while having others that are friendly, lets you get paid to end the war with seemingly no punishment for starting another right after. They are willing to pay repeatedly, making them feel like overly simple NPCs rather than someone who deserves respect.\r\n\r\nWhile the game does expect there to be walls around tall walls for support, piers underneath buildings over water and gates underneath walls, nothing is stopping you from deleting these restrictions after the thing has already been built. I always end up with 10 block tall towers scattered around the base with arrows for space efficient defense that the game clearly doesn\u2019t want to take place. I also place them on roads using gates, making the defense take no actual space and allowing me to delete the gate after, leaving the towers floating. Better enforcing of these restrictions should be added. \r\n\r\nI hope for the team to fix these exploits, and to maybe also make the diplomat system be more fleshed out.", "timestamp_created": 1737235594, "timestamp_updated": 1737235594, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185850841": {"recommendationid": "185850841", "author": {"steamid": "76561199588789306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 3144, "last_played": 1737225055}, "language": "german", "review": "very god game", "timestamp_created": 1737200064, "timestamp_updated": 1737200064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185828452": {"recommendationid": "185828452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019550271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 333, "playtime_at_review": 752, "last_played": 1736902795}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cute little city builder, complex enough to be fun, easy enough to be accessible to everyone.\n\nIt's entirely self directed, which I really enjoy, nothing is super pressing and the difficulty is pretty much just the number of peasants you have.\n\nSaying that it's not a 100 hour game, it peters out around the same point with every new kingdom.

entertaining\n- Gives off a very unique feel similar to age of empires but in its own genre that also focuses on city building and relations even though its basic. \n- The ai, barbarians and dragons make it pretty interesting. \n\nCons\n\n- Would benefit this game a little more if it was multiplayer\n- Would also benefit the game slightly more if there was a better way to expand territory as well as if the games maps in genera were significantly larger. \n- needs more medieval music.", "timestamp_created": 1736608079, "timestamp_updated": 1736608079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

It took a few false starts to get the hang of the mechanics, but after that it was great. The best thing I like about it is that it doesn't eventually devolve into a traffic simulator, as the city gets bigger, like many city simulator games. The citizens clip through each other and some objects, so traffic isn't an issue. The only thing is that different path types have faster travel speeds, so you could upgrade them to make the citizens walk faster on the roads. Instead, you need to focus on having resources close enough to the citizens for easy access, but some can't be too close, since citizens don't like that (due to noise, smell, etc.). The invading vikings and dragons add an extra element that keeps you on your toes, especially if you do any of the harder game modes. Overall, great game that has a charming and slightly unpolished feel that I like.", "timestamp_created": 1735316298, "timestamp_updated": 1735316298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,
