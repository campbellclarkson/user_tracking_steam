It offers a range of tools for real-time facial animation, but its appeal depends on what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nPros\r\nWide Avatar Selection: The software includes a variety of avatars, from cute animals to detailed fantasy characters, giving you flexibility for different uses.\r\nCustomizability: You can tweak avatars or even import custom ones (though this requires some technical skill).\r\nGood Webcam Tracking: The facial tracking is decent for most casual purposes, like streaming or video calls, though it can struggle with rapid movements.\r\nStreaming Integration: Works well with platforms like OBS, making it easy to use for streaming or content creation.\r\nCons\r\nOutdated Interface: The interface feels clunky and hasn't seen significant updates in years, making it less intuitive than newer tools.\r\nPerformance Issues: It can be resource-heavy, especially on older PCs, which may cause frame drops during streaming.\r\nLimited Realism: While fun, the tracking and animations are not as refined as more advanced software (like VTuber-focused tools).\r\nDLC Costs: Many additional avatars and features require paid DLC, which can make the experience feel incomplete without spending extra.\r\nWho Should Buy It?\r\nCasual Users: If you're looking for a lighthearted tool to add flair to your streams or have fun with friends, FaceRig is worth checking out.\r\nBudget VTubers: While it\u2019s not the best for professional setups, it\u2019s a good entry point for beginners experimenting with VTubing.\r\nFinal Verdict\r\nFaceRig is an entertaining, if slightly dated, piece of software that can spark creativity for casual users. However, if you're after high-end tracking or professional-grade tools, you may want to look at alternatives.\r\n\r\nRating: 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1735890629, "timestamp_updated": 1735890629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184495487": {"recommendationid": "184495487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861410590", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3159, "last_played": 1717224773}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521d\u4e09\u90a3\u5e74\u9876\u7740\u72f8\u732b\u5934\u4e0a\u7f51\u8bfe\u4e0a\u4e86\u4e00\u5e74", "timestamp_created": 1735789627, "timestamp_updated": 1735789627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 6782, "total_negative": 1622, "total_reviews": 8404}, "cursors": {"AoJ4w6bKgIYDeuf89gM=": "Mon Jan 20 17:23:54 2025"}}
