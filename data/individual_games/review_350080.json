At first you're excited cause of the location and where you're going. You're excited for the story that led to the first game. But the game goes off the rails with zombies at one point. The \"stealth\" hardly exists where as it's something you can actually do in the first game. This game you CAN stealth certain sections it's not anything close to the first game. The climbing mechanic is lame, I don't like having to left click hold, right click hold, let go of left click, left click hold, etc. etc. Breaking the walls mechanic is half assed, you end up throwing your knives at the walls half the time. Speaking of walls and climbing segments you'll end up in a room/dead end trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. Guess what? It's some climbable wall that just blends into the environment, looks like it's just an asset. Same with the breakable walls. Some points in the combat like when escaping Wolfenstien is ridiculous. The tram part is just dumb with out accurate and how many grenades the enemies throw. On top of that, majority of the enemies in this game are armored. Which goes back to the stealth bit, you can't stealth your way past armored people cause headshots do nothing and shooting them multiple times they will yell. They really shoe horned a bunch of crap into this game for what reasons? I'm not sure. I just really hope that the next game doesn't have everything this game does. I really hope it goes back to the way the first game was.\n\nI wanted to play a game where the Nazis were messing with the occult stuff and making grotesque machines with human body parts and stuff, not a Nazi zombies game. The ONLY way this game \"makes sense\" is if it's canon to Doom. That being said, not ONCE in the first game, which takes place AFTER this game, did BJ ever mention anything about zombies or people coming back from the dead. Which would have been something that would of 100% been brought up if this game came out BEFORE the first game.

However, \"The Old Blood\" takes you back in time and undercover to the infamous CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN!!! \r\n\r\nThe game is divided into 2 parts with the 2nd part taking a drastic turn (for the best). The 1st half feels like a normal shooter but then the 2nd half really kicks in the \"Wolfenstein\" element, with the diabolical scheme that the Nazi's were undergoing deep in the catacombs of the church. The characters that were introduced were all great additions to the lore, sadly they were all expendable and we will see none of them again. The game also gives you a \"choice\" option although it really does not matter who you pick to save (sadly). \r\n\r\nShooting is just what you would expect from a \"Wolfenstein\" game, pulse pounding shootouts, gory executions and phenomenal gun-play. Game-play is solid overall, loved the retro weapons that were utilized in this prequel as well, a nice homage to the previous \"Wolfenstein\" titles and the WW2 German weapons. Still sadly not one MP-40 in sight. No idea what Machine Games has against the MP-40. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this game is a wonderful addition to the \"Wolfenstein\" IP. A little too short IMO but that's only because I was having so much fun with this title. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters with a sweat dripping combat loop, great exploration and awesome story.", "timestamp_created": 1736648814, "timestamp_updated": 1736648814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185388518": {"recommendationid": "185388518", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215099762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 164, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1736632847}, "language": "turkish", "review": "bi anda zombilerin ba\u015flamas\u0131 \u015fahsen \u00e7ok iyi olmam\u0131\u015f ama yinede \u00e7ok iyi oyundur oynay\u0131n", "timestamp_created": 1736633848, "timestamp_updated": 1736633848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185381594": {"recommendationid": "185381594", "author": {"steamid": "76561199187610473", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 370, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1736631554}, "language": "turkish", "review": "ate\u015f eden zombi mi olur amk", "timestamp_created": 1736627957, "timestamp_updated": 1736627957, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185369133": {"recommendationid": "185369133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353510707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 797, "playtime_at_review": 934, "last_played": 1736618092}, "language": "german", "review": "Nazis t\u00f6ten ist immer noch witzig :) Kann ich auch empfehlen.\n", "timestamp_created": 1736618188, "timestamp_updated": 1736618188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185324943": {"recommendationid": "185324943", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991415895", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 380, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1736487286}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has greatly improved graphics/rendering compared to New Order and that is surprising given it still running Id Tech 5.

Blazkowicz e o agente s\u00e3o capturados e enquanto um est\u00e1 sendo interrogado pelo Rudi J\u00e4ger (um adestrador de c\u00e3es s\u00e1dico) o outro tem  que escapar (que no caso esse \u00e9 o B.J.) e ainda conseguir as informa\u00e7\u00f5es de Helga. Escapando do castelo (ap\u00f3s o colega agente falecer) Blazkowicz vai \u00e0 um vilarejo perto onde estava uma agente, indo at\u00e9 essa ela Blazkowicz descobre onde Helga est\u00e1 e tenta conseguir as informa\u00e7\u00f5es se infiltrando em uma festa, por\u00e9m obviamente d\u00e1 tudo errado novamente j\u00e1 que ele \u00e9 descoberto e uma explos\u00e3o perto do vilarejo acontece transformando as pessoas em zumbis, escapando do vilarejo e salvando uma das pessoas que ele conheceu (seja uma judia que queria encontrar a amiga ou um cara que pretendia ir at\u00e9 Berlim protestar contra o nazismo) ele vai at\u00e9 as catacumbas onde Helga est\u00e1 (j\u00e1 que ela estava liderando uma escava\u00e7\u00e3o e os soldados tentaram abrir um cofre q liberou um g\u00e1s verde que resultou nos zumbis) e encontra Helga e um oficial chamado Emmerich Schreiner (personagem esquec\u00edvel) abrindo o cofre e libertando uma criatura gigante respons\u00e1vel pelo g\u00e1s mortal. Helga tenta controlar a criatura mas n\u00e3o consegue assim a ferindo e matando o Emmerich, ent\u00e3o Blazkowicz d\u00e1 cabo no monstro e finalmente consegue a pasta de Helga que cont\u00e9m a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do general Deathshead por\u00e9m desmaia com uma pedra caindo em sua cabe\u00e7a, ele \u00e9 resgatado pelo Fergus (personagem do The New Order) e assim voltam \u00e0 base para a \u00faltima tentativa dos Aliados de vencerem a Guerra, matar o general Deathshead Wilhelm Strasse. [h3]\n\n\u00c9 um jogo OK, a primeira metade dele \u00e9 boa por\u00e9m quando os soldados nazistas viram zumbis o jogo d\u00e1 uma ca\u00edda, parecendo uma vers\u00e3o gen\u00e9rica e sem gra\u00e7a do modo Nazi Zombies (CoD World at War). Personagens s\u00e3o esquec\u00edveis com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do Rudi J\u00e4ger (j\u00e1 que ele \u00e9 um boss) e a vil\u00e3 do jogo \u00e9 sem gra\u00e7a comparada \u00e0 Irene Engel (The New Colossus) ou Deathshead (The New Order).\n\nD\u00e1 para dividir esse jogo em tr\u00eas partes: Castelo Wolfenstein (a melhor parte), vilarejo e catacumbas. \u00c9 um jogo curto q d\u00e1 pra aumentar o tempo jogando os n\u00edveis do Wolfenstein 3D (uma fase por cap\u00edtulo que est\u00e3o escondidas no mapa) e indo atr\u00e1s de colet\u00e1veis mas ainda sim o tempo de jogo vai ser curto no total.\n\nN\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo ruim mas \u00e9 mediano, n\u00e3o fede e nem cheira.

Wonder why I had the sudden urge to play this in late 2024 after I'd already owned it a few years. Huh. A mystery for the ages.\r\n\r\nAnyway! It's a good time - if you've played a Wolfenstein game - and who are we kidding, you almost certainly have - then you know what to expect here. The negatives are sparse, and here they go:\r\n\r\n1) Bethesda, please, I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart - stop making it so goddamn hard to alt-tab while playing. I'm not a playtester. It's not my job to be in the game for 8 uninterrupted hours. I have stuff to do. This is an application on my computer, I should have the option to move to something else and back.\r\n\r\n2) Along the same lines, Bethesda, I don't need like 30 seconds to a minute of unskippable bullshit every time I load it. Get with the times. And by \"the times\" I mean \"any year after like 1995\".\r\n\r\n3) Quicksaves. Come on. The times per #2. I have other stuff going on. Sure, the autosaves are pretty copious, but your desire to prevent people enjoying the game via savescumming doesn't supercede your players' desire to be able to actually pick up where we left off. Plenty of games prevent quicksaves in combat. Plenty of BETHESDA games already do that. I'm not asking you to reinvent the wheel, just plug in the functionality that already exists in like 98% of all other games.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. The game's a short one by Wolfenstein standards - 16 hours here (including alt-tabbing and whatnot) and it's done on normal difficulty. I could go achievement-hunting and sink another 5-10 hours into it, but I'm not feeling the urge right now, not when I've got 3 more Wolfensteins to play. The skill tree is smaller than the other games, but the difference they make is actually noticeable. The plot's as straightforward as they get.\r\n\r\nHell, the only thing that I'd call a complaint about gameplay/plot/anything that isn't just the meta-structure of the game itself (like quicksaves or loading) is that the scare chords in the last part of the game get a bit . . . tiresome. Didn't bother me as much as it apparently bothers some others, though, so go with your own tolerance there.\r\n\r\nOh, and the Nightmare levels are *way* easier here than in The New Order, at least. (If you don't know what that means, it's fine, it's not a necessary part of the game or anything.)\r\n\r\nAll in all, a good bite-sized addition to the franchise.\r\n\r\nOH. One other thing, though. The monologues. They started out darkly atmospheric. Then they got tiresome. \"Oh, look, a new area, B.J. is gonna monologue about some dust bowl dirt-farmer gray-ass drudgery.  \"Smells of damp and mold. Reminds me of Barker. He was my dog 'til I was 8. Got stuck under the porch. Turned into a mold monster. I had to rip his head off with my bare hands while I cried . . .\".\" After about 8 hours it kinda turned funny for a while. By the end it was fine, but . . . yeah that's a thing.

(4/5)\r\n\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, un prequel bourr\u00e9 d\u2019action et d\u2019adr\u00e9naline, qui m\u00e9lange l\u2019horreur gothique et le chaos nazi avec brio.\"\r\n\r\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par MachineGames, est un retour aux racines de la franchise, proposant une aventure plus compacte et nostalgique. Avec son ambiance de film d\u2019horreur allemand des ann\u00e9es 1940, le jeu capture l\u2019essence des classiques tout en enrichissant l\u2019exp\u00e9rience avec des m\u00e9caniques modernes. Une exp\u00e9rience intense et sanglante pour les amateurs de FPS narratifs.\r\n\r\nLes Points Forts :\r\n\u2705 Retour aux sources avec un style nostalgique : Situ\u00e9 avant les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de The New Order, ce jeu plonge dans l\u2019infiltration de Castle Wolfenstein et la chasse \u00e0 des artefacts occultes. Parfait pour les fans de longue date de la s\u00e9rie.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Action fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique et vari\u00e9e : Avec un arsenal classique et des ajouts tels que le tuyau multifonctionnel (outil et arme), le gameplay est \u00e0 la fois rapide et flexible.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Environnement immersif : Le m\u00e9lange d\u2019architecture nazie imposante et de ruines gothiques ajoute une atmosph\u00e8re oppressante et immersive.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Ennemis vari\u00e9s : Des soldats nazis aux cr\u00e9atures zombiesques, le jeu maintient une bonne diversit\u00e9 de menaces, renfor\u00e7ant la tension.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Narration efficace : Bien que plus l\u00e9ger sur l\u2019histoire que The New Order, le jeu reste engageant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des dialogues bien \u00e9crits et une ambiance bien dos\u00e9e.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Prix abordable : En tant que standalone, il offre un excellent rapport qualit\u00e9/prix pour les joueurs souhaitant une aventure compacte.\r\n\r\nLes Points Faibles :\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Dur\u00e9e de vie courte : Avec environ 6 \u00e0 8 heures de jeu, l\u2019aventure peut sembler un peu br\u00e8ve pour les joueurs cherchant une exp\u00e9rience plus \u00e9toff\u00e9e.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Histoire moins m\u00e9morable : Compar\u00e9 \u00e0 The New Order, le sc\u00e9nario est plus simple et manque d\u2019\u00e9motion ou de profondeur.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Structure lin\u00e9aire : Bien que l\u2019action soit intense, le manque de niveaux ouverts ou d\u2019objectifs secondaires peut limiter la rejouabilit\u00e9.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Difficult\u00e9 in\u00e9gale : Certains passages, notamment avec les zombies, peuvent devenir frustrants en raison de la densit\u00e9 des ennemis.\r\n\r\nEn conclusion :\r\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood est une aventure pr\u00e9quelle qui m\u00e9lange brillamment les m\u00e9caniques de tir modernes avec une ambiance r\u00e9tro-gothique. Bien qu\u2019il manque un peu de profondeur narrative et que sa dur\u00e9e soit limit\u00e9e, il compense par des s\u00e9quences d\u2019action palpitantes, des environnements m\u00e9morables, et un hommage sinc\u00e8re aux origines de la franchise.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfae Verdict final :\r\nUn excellent choix pour les fans de FPS qui souhaitent une dose intense de carnage et de nostalgie, sans s\u2019engager dans une campagne longue.\r\n\r\n\u23f3 Temps de jeu recommand\u00e9 : 6 \u00e0 8 heures pour l\u2019histoire principale, avec des d\u00e9fis pour prolonger un peu l\u2019exp\u00e9rience.\r\n\u2728 Note personnelle : \"Exploser des nazis tout en affrontant des zombies dans un ch\u00e2teau sinistre ?

Neither of them are Deathshead, but Rudi and his dog Greta are especially memorable.\r\n\r\nFor your friends, you have \"Agent One\", Wesley, who teaches a clever little trick about dealing with stress, which B.J. later recites in The New Order. Your contact in the village, Kessler, is an admirable resistance fighter, but like most of the characters in The Old Blood, doesn't have much character development. The woman he protects, Annette, is a Jewish refugee looking for her sister in the decrepit and mysterious town of Wulfberg, home to Castle Wolfenstein, the main setting for half of the game, and the place B.J. has escaped once already. You also meet \"Agent Two\", Pippa, as well as Fergus (the latter only at the ending), but Fergus doesn't receive as much characterisation until The New Order.\r\n\r\nAlthough not as interesting of a story, The Old Blood is as good as any excuse to listen to B.J. Blazkowicz monologue, and the environments of the Nazi super concrete structures are awesome as ever to kill Nazis en masse in.\r\n\r\nIf you can, get both The Old Blood and The New Order.

base.''Wolfsetein the old blood'' \u00e9 aquele jogo que pode ser visto como um ''mais do mesmo''mas ele certamente n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 te desapontar.\r\n\r\nHistoria e visual:\r\n- Esse jogo se passa antes do 'the new order' focando em acontecimentos da d\u00e9cada de 40 e mostrando os N@zist@s com sua tecnologia que j\u00e1 estava muito avan\u00e7ada.Acompanhamos B.J adrentando nas entralhas do castelo Wolfenstein e enfrentando as armadilhas do castelo e acontecimentos fora do ''normal''.\r\n- O gr\u00e1fico do jogo ainda se apresenta ser o mesmo igual ao seu antecessor ! mas isso n\u00e3o tira o m\u00e9rito desse jogo de forma alguma,na verdade ainda \u00e9 um bom ponto positivo j\u00e1 que: boa parte dos cen\u00e1rios s\u00e3o mt bem construidos e detalhados.\r\n\r\nGameplay e efeitos sonoros:\r\n- A gameplay ainda se mant\u00e9m mesma igual ao anterior..as novidades aqui \u00e9 que temos alguns inimigos novos e armas ''novas'' tamb\u00e9m,no jogo podemos utilizar uma ferramenta que ser\u00e1 mt utilizada ao decorrer da campanha ! e que tr\u00e1s elementos novos de play.\r\n- Os efeitos sonoros continuam bons e trazem um novo elemento..o terror.\r\nA tria sonora pode se tornar ausente para alguns com o decorrer do jogo..mas ela brilha de fato nos momentos chave.\r\n\r\nPontos negativos:\r\n- A historia infelizmente n\u00e3o \u00e9 l\u00e1 grande coisa n\u00e3o,na verdade ela se torna bastante esquecivel quando vc lembra que 'new order' apresenta uma trama mt melhor..e isso aplica nos personagens tamb\u00e9m ! boa parte infelizmente acaba n\u00e3o se tornando t\u00e3o marcantes((nem mesmo os vil\u00e3oes)).\r\nApesar de ter tido uma mec\u00e2nica nova nesse jogo AINDA \u00e9 triste o fato de ter tido elementos a mais na gameplay.\r\n\r\nVale a pena ?:\r\n- Se vc jogou 'the new order' e achou o jogo excelente,ent\u00e3o eu recomendo fortemente esse jogo.Ele continua tendo uma boa gameplay e tr\u00e1s elementos dos antigos Wolfenstai\u00b4ns pra nossa modernidade, apesar da campanha ser bem vers\u00e1til nos seus cen\u00e1rios..ainda \u00e9 bem triste a falta de um enredo mais elaborado((pelo menos ele \u00e9 bem divertido)).\r\nEsse jogo vale seu tempo e dinheiro,se vc gosta de Wolfenstein e de fps com jogabildidade que lembra a velha guarda..ent\u00e3o esse jogo \u00e9 pra vc.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735246241, "timestamp_updated":
