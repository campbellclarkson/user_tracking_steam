It's just low-res textures, dreadful lighting and blockiness everywhere. Secondly, the AI is clearly designed for console peasants using an analogue stick to aim. You target them and they just stand there shooting you without any movement whatsoever. Very engaging. Difficulty mode has no effect on this either. Not to mention that the controls feel stiff and clunky, unlike the modern Battlefronts.

It's an amazing simple game to pick up and have a blast, through Galactic Conquest where you capture individual planets and locations throughout the Star Wars Universe, through the Campaign where you engage in the events within a 501st Journal, or you simply just want to choose the map and rules within Instant Action. Multiplayer is alive, even more so than Classic Collection, and you get to choose the server you want to join through the server list, so getting into a server is even easier than the modern Battlefront's (probably going to get a lot of clown Steam awards for that but don't care). Also, Star Wars Battlefront 2 2005 can be played in both third person and first person for most units and vehicles.\n\nThrough a technological standpoint alone, this game is remarkable. This game has seamless dogfights to in-freighter combat within the space maps, where you can destroy the internal systems of said freighter. You could even steal a spaceship from the enemy freighter and land it into your own team's freighter, which while might not give you any advantage, goes to show how much freedom is presented within the game (on the topic of freedom, heroes / villains like Darth Vader can ride vehicles like Speeders, AT-AT's, etc, which in most Battlefront games is exclusive to the troops). This game offers multiple different gamemodes as well. In XL mode (exclusive to Kashyyyk, Hoth, and Geonosis since they're larger maps), the amount of present units per teams is majorly increased, and in hunt mode you can play as or fight against the indigenous species of planets throughout the Star Wars universe. This could be fighting the Geonosians as a clone trooper, destroying units as a Wampa, defeating droids as a Gungan and more. All of what I have mentioned within this paragraph is not present within other Battlefront games.\n\nEach planet has its own vibe and conditions. On Polis Massa (an asteroid from Episode III), you will take damage when into the central space zone of the map when playing as any class other than the droids, which makes sense as droids do not require oxygen, furthermore showing the attention put into this game. In Jabba's palace, you'll find Gamorrean Guards attacking and attempting to take command posts on rare occasions. Each map has a different vibe from the last, making playing each map more worthwhile. \n\nSomething worth noting is this game is less of a 'Battlefront' of trying to fully simulate what it's like being a trooper within the Clone Wars / Galatic Civil war, but rather the game is more of a power fantasy style game in how the AI isn't as aggressive to you compared to other Battlefront games. This is also a reason why multiplayer is so fun, as other players with potentially similar skill levels can fight against you and other AI (if the server isn't full then the match is pvpve rather than pvp). The only con with multiplayer is that the Dark Side (Empire / CIS) tend to have a better chance at winning as some people (you know who you are) tend to spam Force Choke, a Dark Side exclusive ability that is ridiculously OP as its victim is unable to move or defend, which hence definitely breaks the fun at times.\n\nPeople also report a black screen bug, this is normally because they have Discord Overlay turned on, which tends to not work well with the game. Another bug that people find is that on certain maps (Examples include Kashyyyk, Dagobah, Yavin 4, some modded maps, etc) the water looks very odd, this is because the game doesn't fully support resolutions above 1080p, so to fix this either play the game at 1080p or less, or download the Shader Patch mod on Moddb (more on mods later though). Other issues that are caused by unsupported resolutions include small UI, Mission Select Screen not having a matching aspect ratio, some scopes causing half the screen to have a strange screenshot-esque picture. \n\nThis game has a huge modding community as well, this is perhaps one of if not the Star Wars game with the most mods. The website to go to when searching for mods is ModdB, as that's where the largest amount of mods are for the game when on the internet. I would've given this game a 9/10 if it weren't for the mods, as the mods fix so many issues with the game and add so much more, whether it be new eras, gamemodes, maps, sides, etc. The main reason for the amount mods is that Pandemic's developer tools are available to be downloaded online (though I recommend the 2020 SDK over the original as the 2020 SDK fixes multiple issues when trying to create mods). Creating mods through these tools is super complex and sometimes doesn't end up right and so a large portion of creating a mod is trial and error. Yes I did create a mod of my own. Yes it's horrible. There are some truly talented modders within ModdB, so I do highly recommend attempting to go get some mods. For map mods you need an Addon folder within SWBF2 2005's Gamedata folder and then simply put in the three letter code folder of the map mod inside said Addon folder. Make sure you have the mod dependencies (if there is any), and I highly recommend getting Mod Loader since there is a 500 mission limit which if you exceed will cause crashes.\n\nWell there's my review for my favourite game ever, so yeah.
