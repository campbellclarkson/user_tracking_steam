I was introduced to the series and fighting games as a whole through Guilty Gear Strive, but Guilt Gear Xrd REV 2 captured my heart. I enjoy the fast pacing, tight inputs, and mental chess you have to play with your opponent. The game has a surprising amount of singleplayer content, which is something a lot of more modern fighting games lack. It's got a charming lobby system and a decent deal of customization to boast, too. The game has a lower barrier of entry than it first seems, which seems to be a common fallacy from the outside looking in. Although the ranked modes and lobby system can be empty due to the games dwindling playerbase, there is certainly enough to get started and the reward for your skill improvement is immense. Each character stands a decent chance at facing one another, and the skill expression on each individual fighter is practically endless. It's a quirky game, and it's not for everyone, but the amount of value you receive for sticking with it and improving is monumental. It's clear that each aspect of the game was crafted with a passion and attention to detail that truly makes the game special. This game is incredibly fun to watch and has some of the most hype moments I've seen in any game. I'd recommend Guilty Gear Xrd REV 2 to anyone even moderately interested in fighting games, as the payback you get on this hardly $20 purchase is insane. (And it goes on sale a ton, too!) I'm not the greatest at fighting games, and Guilty Gear is definitely a series with a high skill ceiling, but I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what I can do by what this game has to offer. This game is a must for any fighting game player, and my personal favorite in the Guilty Gear franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1735505992, "timestamp_updated": 1735505992, "voted_up": true,
