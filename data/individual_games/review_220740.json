So, you may have to click multiple times to select inventory items.  Lowering the Refresh Rate, and Frame Rate(FPS) down to 60 helped a lot, but it does not stop this issue.  \n\n     There are lots of [i]Dialogue Puzzles[/i] even a [i]time[/i] based puzzle that is a fighting game.  I'm surprised they haven't learned from the past mistakes of older Point & Click games;  most players don't want to see this kind of mechanic in a game that's supposed to be layed back and fun; not stressful.  There are tons of time based, and fighting games if we want to play those.  One part of the game requires a player to access the menu system to solve a problem; This is the first Point & Click game I've [i]ever[/i] played that had this weird mechanic in a puzzle.  How many people are going to think to go to the menu screen to solve a puzzle?! I would suggest saving fairly often in this game as there is another puzzle mechanic that may cause a player to lose hours of progress, but I won't say what it is, as I don't want to spoil it.\n\n     There are also issues with illogical puzzles, and dialogue that all but tells you [i]how[/i] to solve a puzzle, otherwise known as hand-holding.  The beginning of the game has lots of dialogue and cutscenes, which was very annoying.  I couldn't perform a single action without the NPCs, in the scene, commenting on what I was doing.  There is also a long cutscene that, if you skip it, you miss important information.  You can skip through the dialogue in the cutscene but one press of the Escape Key(skip scene), and you may miss crucial information.  There are other puzzles that basically force you into the decision they want you to make, and there is next to no chance that you won't [i]solve[/i] it;  this is what I like to call a pseudo-puzzle.  \n\nAnother thing that annoyed me was when the dialogue choices you could make were just a couple of words, such as, \"Ummm...well...\", and, after clicking it, would add a new option of something like, \"It's like this...\", and this would repeat like four or five times.  I don't like having to click there a score of these to hear what could have just been done in a cutscene.  Those aren't all the problems I found in the game, but they were some of the main offenders.\n\nWith all that said, I did have fun in parts of the game.  There were sections of the game where I just wanted the game to be over, then afterwards I'd find myself enjoying the game again.  It was like a rollercoaster ride!  The English translations, while far from perfect, weren't as horrendous as in Deponia I.  There was a big improvement here.  There were lots of jokes, and stupid actions Rufus would take that I found hilarious;  this type of comedy won't be for everyone.  There were a few parts that I thought were overly cruel and, not cool;  the way Rufus treats this homeless guy for instance.\n\nAnyway, I'm giving this game a 4.5/10, for all bad puzzles, typos, bad English, and, mainly, the bugs that were missed in the testing of the game, and were never fixed.  I bought this game in a bundle and only spent $0.99U.S. for it, but I can't recommend paying full price for this game.  Just as I said about [i]Deponia, Chaos on Deponia[/i] has a lot of potential, and many good features;  the bad outweighs the good however.  If you can get the game on sale, and you can tolerate the annoying aspects of this game, there is still fun to be had!", "timestamp_created": 1736386916, "timestamp_updated": 1736386940, "voted_up":

"last_played": 1735999823}, "language": "english", "review": "I quite enjoyed the first game in this series and hoped this sequel would give me more of the same. Understand I really wanted to love this game. There are a few positives, however overall I have found it insufferable, and 5.4 hours in I gave up.\n\nGameplay:\nI've found this game to be really confusing and non-linear. There is not enough indication as to what order you're meant to do things in, so some interactions don't make sense. Games like these need to be intuitive, so the player can enjoy finding their way through. The map is big and complex, which  if executed differently could be a joy to play through. The game is chaotic, but not in a lovable fun way: the only way to solve much of it seems to be using online guides, and even then the solutions often feel ridiculous. Honestly I've found myself just trying to go through the motions to advance the story. \n\nArt:\nDeponia games have a really cool art style, and the art in this game is beautiful. In the first game, the art style kind of emphasised the things you might be able to interact with. However in this one it looks like everything and everyone should be interactive, so it's almost impossible to go without hitting space bar for hints in every area, and it can be disappointing to be unable to pick up items you want.\n\nDialogue:\nIn the first game it always felt like it fit. Here it is gratuitous, and so slow. There are far too many words you have to sit through, it makes the game slow, unless you want to skip hearing every line in character voice which breaks the immersion. It's particularly maddening when you have to listen to the same 10 line dialogue every time you try another solution to a problem. Looking at you, [spoiler]Bozo, Bambina and Gondola man... and that dog's awful laugh.[/spoiler] Also a good amount of speech in this game is gratuitous. In the first game, you needed to listen carefully and think about a lot of the dialogue. This time there is a lot of fluff.\n\nCharacters:\nRufus is this game's saving grace. He's still funny, likeable, and interesting. However Goal... is so 2 dimensional it almost hurts. Admittedly I'm less that 5 hours into gameplay, so it's possible that she might improve, but right now the bar is in hell. The concept of [spoiler]the character's personality being split into three main parts[/spoiler] seemed cool, and I was looking forward to getting to know her better through this device. But she's basically just the three fantasies of men, each one executed in a really shallow way. The studio have shown that they can write women, with Toni in the first game: I could relate to her, and her interactions with Rufus had a charm. It's like they just got lazy.\n\nAdditional note: during the scene with [spoiler]the guard dog[/spoiler], I felt like I was playing through someone else's badly executed fetish.\n\nOn the whole, I'm disappointed. I was grinding through, hoping it would pick up, but after my 'reward' for progress was being randomly surprised by [spoiler]those camera angles on a for-some-reason bikini-clad Goal, opposite what Rufus is wearing in the same scene[/spoiler], I honestly can't give it any more chances.\n\n2/10, pick it up on sale if you don't believe me, and expect to be frustrated.", "timestamp_created": 1736003695, "timestamp_updated": 1736004120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184710774": {"recommendationid": "184710774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041376523", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 528, "last_played": 1735961654}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game too difficult without a guide.
