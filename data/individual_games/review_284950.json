The piece selection mechanic was neat at first, but grew very old. For some reason, it worked almost perfectly fine on the last puzzle. The pictures are blurry enough that it's a little harder than it needs to be to search for where a piece fits. Pieces cannot be locked together, they can only be placed where they belong in the puzzle, which is annoying. Not a great game for jigsaw puzzle enjoyers.", "timestamp_created": 1735866843, "timestamp_updated": 1735866843, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 2123, "total_negative": 494, "total_reviews": 2617}, "cursors": {"AoJ4kZCulYIDcc6TxwM=": "Mon Jan 20 17:30:07 2025"}}
