The heroes are an important part of the game YET the developers chose not to invest in creating more unique ones and even worse, to allow duplicates to occur - meaning that another faction could be running around the map with an exact duplicate of one of your own heroes.  Each faction on average has just 3 portraits for their heroes BUT that's where the uniqueness ends.  After that, the developers just went ahead and gave 2 differing names and back stories for each portrait and then... wait for it... simply just add a \"II\" (the second) and a \"III\" (the third) to each of the names.  So that's 6 heroes all with the same portrait!  And to add to this, the game further allows duplicates of these heroes to be recruited by any faction through the marketplace!  So there you are with your prized hero, winning battles and leveling up to become your Empire's favorite champion when long behold, you find your enemy with an army that's being led with the exact same hero.  (Oh and in case you are wondering, there's no cloning chamber on the map, so there goes that explanation.  Nope, the reason is just simple laziness and cheapness on the game makers!)  Why this review, because it really is a neat game with it's differing factions, back stories and quests, the layout of the map, the ability to design your units, and lastly, the battling which takes place on a separate tactical map and plays like \"chess on steroids\" BUT unfortunately the lack of unique heroes ruins it all!", "timestamp_created": 1736474252, "timestamp_updated": 1736474252, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415944218635559082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185127200": {"recommendationid": "185127200", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091744751", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1736360714}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430, 3\u0434-\u0448\u043d\u043e 2\u0434-\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c!)", "timestamp_created": 1736360811, "timestamp_updated": 1736360811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48848685622215271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185008263": {"recommendationid": "185008263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402929926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 2346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "playtime_at_review": 2346, "last_played": 1736243653}, "language": "schinese", "review": "  \u4f60\u4eec\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u628a\u505a\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u201d\u7684\u90a3\u7fa4\u50bb\u903c\u8c03\u8fc7\u6765\u6539\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\uff0c\u56f4\u57ce\u91d1\u5e01\u548c\u7cae\u98df\u5730\u5757\u4ea7\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u5f52\u96f6\u662f\u54ea\u4e2a\u5929\u624d\u60f3\u51fa\u6765\u7684\uff1f\u505a\u4efb\u52a1\u5237\u51fa\u6765\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u602a\u628a\u57ce\u4e00\u56f4\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0d\u6da8\u57ce\u5e02\u5012\u6263\u94b1\u90a3\u5408\u7740\u8981\u662f\u6ca1\u50a8\u5907\u90a3\u5c31\u7b49\u6b7b\u5457\u3002\u5916\u4ea4\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u662f\u6ca1\u6709ai\u9488\u5bf9\u73a9\u5bb6\u89c1\u9762\u5c31\u6253\u4f60\u4e00\u8def\u8ffd\u4f60\u8ffd\u5230\u4f60\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u9694\u58c1es2\u90fd\u77e5\u9053\u628a\u5927\u6811\u5927\u5988\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0a\u662f\u548c\u5e73\u548c\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u4f1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u627e\u73a9\u5bb6\u7b7e\u6761\u7ea6\u60a8\u8fd9\u8fd8\u662f\u89c1\u9762\u5c31\u6253\u5462\u3002\n  \u8bf4\u5230es\u9694\u58c1\u6539\u7684\u5012\u662f\u628a\u7eb3\u5361\u7433\u8fd9\u79cd\u672c\u6765\u4e0d\u80fd\u73a9\u7684\u8ba9\u5979\u80fd\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u5728\u60a8\u8fd9\u662f\u628a\u672c\u6765\u51d1\u5408\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6539\u7684\u4e0d\u80fd\u73a9\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1736245424, "timestamp_updated": 1736245424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456603765487670898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184989496": {"recommendationid": "184989496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049223074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1735952522}, "language": "english", "review": "Try as I might I just can't get into this game.

That said, I will try my best to go over a small fraction of what makes this a wonderful game and why you might want to join incredible community attached to it.\r\n\r\nFirstly, what makes it stand out from other 4x titles.\r\n-Custom Factions: You can use one faction as a template, and use them to create a custom faction that plays completely different compared to the original. This has lead to a thriving optimization community for both single, and multiplayer (provided custom factions are on)\r\n-The World Dynamics: The game uses a \"quest\" system wherein you can discover or be given quests that let you win the loyalty of other \"minor\" factions, give you distinct weapons and armor, unique technologies, and much more. I've not seen this done in exhaustive detail elsewhere outside Amplitude games.\r\nCommunity support: The devs have their own discord where players can discuss things with one another and organize multiplayer games (which only require the host to have the DLC in order for all players to be able to use it). While the community is small, they are accepting and encouraging of new players.\r\n\r\nI have more I could say, but this is a recommendation, not a dissertation. If you enjoy 4x games, looking to get into the genre, or just want a game to sink your teeth into I highly reccommend giving Endless Legend a try.\r\n\r\nTLDR: EL's customization, dynamic game elements, and community make this a good game for 4x fans new and old to check out.", "timestamp_created": 1735245590, "timestamp_updated": 1735245590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183710116": {"recommendationid": "183710116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081339988", "num_games_owned": 1034, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2014, "last_played": 1735171591}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games in the genre.
