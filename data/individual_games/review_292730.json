here is easily one of the best COD campaigns of all time. Gameplay is challenging and offers a various opportunities to switch up the classic combat loop. The Solar system setting is home to some of the best Sci-Fi world building the FPS genre has ever seen. Cutscenes are beautiful and well acted including a stunning performance from none other than Jon Snow himself. The enemy Martian SDF are basically the purest form of evil degeneracy mankind could muster so I don't have to feel too bad for sociopathically annihilating their entire command structure and manpower over a blisteringly fast paced guerila warfare campaign. The space combat has never been done this well before or since in the series (the only time it ever came close was the VTOL from BO2) , it's not a simulation by any measure but it makes for a really outstanding fun regardless. It's got emotional beats, action setpeices galore and the graphics hold up extremely well considering this is from a generation of games where developers were just getting their hands on advanced console graphics and hadn't sunk the entire optimization budget into cosmetics storefronts and battle pass integration. I wouldn't usually set an ultimatum like this, but if you don't appreciate the magnificent scale of this campaign, you might just be incompetent on more than a few levels. This game was a favorite of mine when it first released despite the lackluster critical response (critics all suck at FPS) I can't speak on the multiplayer now, it's sadly most likely a deadzone of low player counts or hackers galore, butback in the day it was one of the best and the local/private match system is extrememly functional. Hell some of the most fun I ever had playing COD involved 1v1 quickscope matches on split screen with my old college roomates. If this game is on sale, PICK IT UP. If not, and you're thinking about it, JUST DO IT.

up, don't buy for now\n\nthe game is fine, really. i get that people were tired of the futuristic shit in cod and disliked the hell out of the trailer on youtube, but i think the game isn't *that* bad. the multiplayer is quite fun actually, when the servers aren't dead (which they are the majority of the time) and while the maps are restrictive and don't allow you to fully stretch your legs with the fast-paced almost titanfall-like moveset, you can still use it to your advantage sometimes.\n\nthe campaign is great! which surprised me because i remember back then a lot of people hated this game relentlessly, it's a good campaign beginning to end, i just kinda wish it all ended for basically nothing lol\n\ni haven't played the zombies but i've heard good things about it, just don't

multijoueur dynamique, mais quelques lacunes qui nuisent \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience.\"\r\n\r\nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Infinity Ward et publi\u00e9 par Activision, a suscit\u00e9 de nombreuses r\u00e9actions mitig\u00e9es lors de sa sortie en 2016. Ce jeu est le treizi\u00e8me opus principal de la s\u00e9rie Call of Duty, et il marque un tournant important en introduisant une guerre futuriste dans l'espace, avec une forte composante de science-fiction. L'ambiance de l'histoire, centr\u00e9e sur des conflits interstellaires et des batailles dans l'espace, a divis\u00e9 les fans, certains appr\u00e9ciant le changement de direction, tandis que d'autres ont regrett\u00e9 l'absence de la guerre terrestre classique qui a fait la renomm\u00e9e de la s\u00e9rie.\r\n\r\nMalgr\u00e9 un lancement quelque peu controvers\u00e9, Infinite Warfare propose une exp\u00e9rience globalement agr\u00e9able, avec une campagne solo solide, un mode multijoueur dynamique et des graphismes impressionnants, mais qui laisse quelques r\u00e9serves, notamment sur la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du gameplay.\r\n\r\nLes Points Forts :\r\n\u2705 Une campagne solo immersive et bien \u00e9crite : L'un des points forts de Infinite Warfare r\u00e9side dans sa campagne solo. L'histoire, bien que futuriste et orient\u00e9e science-fiction, propose des personnages attachants, des dialogues int\u00e9ressants et une trame narrative solide. Vous incarnez Nick Reyes, un officier de la Navy engag\u00e9 dans un conflit avec une faction terroriste interstellaire. Le jeu se distingue par sa mise en sc\u00e8ne cin\u00e9matographique, avec des moments d'action intenses et des s\u00e9quences de combat spatiales qui ajoutent de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience.\r\n\u2705 Graphismes et ambiance spatiale r\u00e9ussis : Visuellement, Infinite Warfare est impressionnant. Les effets sp\u00e9ciaux sont sublimes, avec des batailles spatiales spectaculaires, des vaisseaux futuristes et une direction artistique qui parvient \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un monde cr\u00e9dible dans un futur lointain. La mod\u00e9lisation des vaisseaux et des environnements spatiaux est particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9ussie et donne un aspect \u00e9pique aux affrontements. De plus, le jeu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'une excellente fluidit\u00e9, m\u00eame sur des machines plus anciennes.\r\n\u2705 Un mode multijoueur solide et dynamique : Comme pour la plupart des jeux Call of Duty, le mode multijoueur reste l'un des principaux attraits d'Infinite Warfare. Il propose des m\u00e9caniques de gameplay classiques qui ont fait le succ\u00e8s de la s\u00e9rie, avec un syst\u00e8me de progression bien ficel\u00e9 et des armes vari\u00e9es. Les diff\u00e9rents modes de jeu, y compris les classiques Team Deathmatch et Domination, sont tr\u00e8s bien \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s, et les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme les \"Specialist\" (des personnages avec des comp\u00e9tences uniques) ajoutent un peu de fra\u00eecheur. Le syst\u00e8me de cartes et d'armement offre une bonne dose de personnalisation et de rejouabilit\u00e9.\r\n\u2705 Innovations int\u00e9ressantes dans le gameplay : Le jeu introduit quelques nouvelles m\u00e9caniques int\u00e9ressantes, telles que les batailles spatiales en z\u00e9ro gravit\u00e9 et les vaisseaux qui apportent une nouvelle dynamique au gameplay. Les s\u00e9quences en apesanteur offrent une exp\u00e9rience unique par rapport aux autres titres de la franchise et montrent que les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont os\u00e9 sortir des sentiers battus. De plus, la possibilit\u00e9 de personnaliser l'\u00e9quipement et d'explorer diff\u00e9rents types de missions ajoute \u00e0 la vari\u00e9t\u00e9.\r\n\r\nLes Points Faibles :\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Un changement de direction controvers\u00e9 vers la science-fiction : L'un des plus grands d\u00e9fauts d'Infinite Warfare est la direction que le jeu a prise vers un univers de science-fiction avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments futuristes. Bien que cela ait apport\u00e9 de la nouveaut\u00e9, de nombreux fans de la s\u00e9rie Call of Duty, habitu\u00e9s aux combats modernes ou historiques, ont trouv\u00e9 ce changement trop radical. Les combats dans l'espace, les vaisseaux et les nouvelles technologies semblent d\u00e9connect\u00e9s de l'essence de la franchise, et le ton g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du jeu a perdu un peu de la simplicit\u00e9 brute qui caract\u00e9risait les premiers opus de Call of Duty.\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f L'absence d'un mode zombie traditionnel dans le jeu principal : Alors que Call of Duty est bien connu pour son mode Zombie, Infinite Warfare a opt\u00e9 pour une approche diff\u00e9rente en introduisant un mode de zombies dans un univers totalement d\u00e9cal\u00e9. Ce mode est plut\u00f4t amusant et propose une exp\u00e9rience diff\u00e9rente, mais il peut sembler \u00e9trange et moins m\u00e9morable par rapport aux it\u00e9rations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Pour beaucoup, l'absence de la formule classique de zombies a \u00e9t\u00e9 un manque, surtout pour les joueurs fid\u00e8les.\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Les m\u00e9caniques de mouvement futuristes divisent l\u2019exp\u00e9rience : Infinite Warfare introduit de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de gameplay comme le double saut, les glissades et les combats en apesanteur, emprunt\u00e9s \u00e0 des jeux comme Advanced Warfare ou Black Ops 3. Si ces ajouts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s par certains joueurs, d'autres ont trouv\u00e9 que cela d\u00e9naturait l'exp\u00e9rience de Call of Duty, en apportant un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"over-the-top\" au gameplay. Ces m\u00e9caniques de mouvement futuristes, bien que divertissantes, peuvent rendre le gameplay plus chaotique et moins tactique, ce qui peut d\u00e9plaire aux puristes de la franchise.\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f La r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9 de certaines missions et des ennemis : Bien que la campagne offre une histoire int\u00e9ressante et une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de missions, certaines peuvent devenir r\u00e9p\u00e9titives au bout d\u2019un moment. Les types d\u2019ennemis ne sont pas toujours tr\u00e8s originaux, et le design des missions peut se ressentir comme \u00e9tant un peu pr\u00e9visible. En plus, les s\u00e9quences de batailles spatiales, bien qu'int\u00e9ressantes au d\u00e9but, peuvent finir par se r\u00e9p\u00e9ter et perdre en impact au fil du temps.\r\n\r\nEn conclusion :\r\nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare est un jeu qui pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments impressionnants mais qui, en fin de compte, laisse un go\u00fbt mitig\u00e9. La campagne solo est solide, avec une histoire captivante, des personnages int\u00e9ressants et une immersion dans un univers futuriste fascinant. Le mode multijoueur est \u00e9galement un point fort, avec une exp\u00e9rience classique et dynamique, m\u00eame si les changements apport\u00e9s au gameplay peuvent diviser les joueurs. Cependant, la prise de risques dans l'univers de science-fiction n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e, et le manque de certaines m\u00e9caniques traditionnelles de la s\u00e9rie, comme le mode Zombie classique, pourrait d\u00e9cevoir les puristes. Malgr\u00e9 tout, le jeu reste une exp\u00e9rience agr\u00e9able pour les amateurs de Call of Duty et ceux en qu\u00eate de nouveaut\u00e9s.\r\n\r\n\u23f3 Temps de jeu recommand\u00e9 : 10 \u00e0 12 heures pour la campagne principale.\r\n\ud83c\udfae Verdict final : Un jeu solide qui propose une histoire int\u00e9ressante et un mode multijoueur efficace, mais qui souffre de quelques choix de conception controvers\u00e9s.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735591621, "timestamp_updated": 1735591621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184249329": {"recommendationid": "184249329", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985550615", "num_games_owned": 783, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 694, "last_played": 1735587471}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm already 14 years old, yet I don't understand the message of this game.\r\nThe story is telling me how the fascist mars government is evil, yet it's everything Mr. Elmo Musk wants.\r\nI think the devs just got confused.\r\n\r\nI can't wait to sign up for the space force and die in a war. \r\n\r\nI wish I could shoot people with a different accent right now.\r\n\r\n10/10 perfect american army propaganda. \r\n\r\nSemper fi.", "timestamp_created": 1735587890, "timestamp_updated": 1735587890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184242287": {"recommendationid": "184242287", "author": {"steamid": "76561199811174524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 565, "last_played": 1737161773}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1735582691, "timestamp_updated": 1735582691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184227646": {"recommendationid": "184227646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314894208", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1735574299}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0421\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f CoD \u0441 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0445 MW", "timestamp_created": 1735572198, "timestamp_updated": 1735572198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184196324": {"recommendationid": "184196324", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186806763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "playtime_at_review": 2028, "last_played": 1737330207}, "language": "german", "review": "gutes spiel kann ich pers\u00f6nlich weiter empfehlen", "timestamp_created": 1735543330, "timestamp_updated": 1735543330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184194297": {"recommendationid": "184194297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067179972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 1242, "last_played": 1736208937}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing with bots on multiplayer is satisfying - they seem to work on the relatively fantastic code of COD Ghost's bots (dropshotting, jumping around corners to surprise you, throwing all kinds of grenades, using special abilities).

I will not touch on the multiplayer mode, which appears to be essentially dead (finding an online match in Europe seems near impossible), nor on the cooperative Zombies mode. While Zombies in Call of Duty has long been the domain of Treyarch, I\u2019m curious to see how Infinity Ward handles it, though that\u2019s a topic for another time.\r\n\r\nA Personal Milestone in the Call of Duty Series\r\n\r\nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare marked a significant milestone for me as it was the last Call of Duty campaign I played after many years of following the franchise. Being an iterative series with annual releases, there are plenty of campaigns to go through, but with this one, I can finally say I\u2019ve played and completed every Call of Duty title\u2014at least until the next one drops in 2025 (and the cycle repeats).\r\n\r\nA Refreshing Approach to the Campaign\r\n\r\nInfinite Warfare takes the series into uncharted territory with its sci-fi space warfare theme, a stark departure from the grounded, modern, or historical settings we had been accustomed to before its release in 2016. While the campaign retains many of the familiar elements of Call of Duty\u2014cinematic action, high-octane sequences, and a well-paced narrative\u2014it distinguishes itself through its structure and execution.\r\n\r\nGone are the repetitive mission-to-mission transitions and formulaic cutscenes. Instead, Infinite Warfare introduces seamless mission continuity, allowing you to explore your ship, interact with the crew, and even choose optional side missions spread across the solar system. These additions give the game a sense of agency and immersion that few other Call of Duty titles achieve. The gameplay also benefits from varied mechanics, such as Star Wars-esque dogfights in space, planetary exploration, and intense infantry battles.\r\n\r\nA Story Worth Investing In\r\n\r\nWhat truly sets Infinite Warfare apart is its well-crafted story and characters. Unlike previous campaigns, which often featured over-the-top, cringe-worthy narratives that felt forced, this game delivers a narrative that feels sincere and heartfelt. You\u2019ll find yourself empathizing with the characters, understanding their motivations, and becoming emotionally invested in their fates.
