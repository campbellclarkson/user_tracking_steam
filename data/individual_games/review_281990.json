It's just hard / tedious to get into. A bit too tedius really.\n\nImportant note: This review is written shortly before 4.0, so may warrant an update soon.\n\nThe UI can be unintuitive at times. (How long it took me to figure out how to merge fleets is just embarrassing)\n\nInformation about what some start actually does and what influences it can be hard ot come by. (What feeds into colony stability? any deficit? crime? defence armies? assult armies?. How to i get a good overview of all my trade routes, not just 1 station related stuff? Pirate spawns, what can you do to prevent them that actually works?  stations? do I need one in every system for it to work? or in trade-protection range? does any random ship work for deterrence? will they just spawn randomly?)\n\nManaging land armies is a pain in the ass. It all boils down to comparing numbers anyway, but it takes so much fiddly busiwork that adds little.\n\nWargoals and peace are ... poorly done frankly. You can steamroll some city state controll all of their territory. but still be forced to settle for white peace (reset territory to pre war state and gain nothing) because you didn't invade 1 planet. If a stray colony revolts and breaks off they are immortal for 10 years. Maybe an experienced player would be used to playing aorund this, but for a new player it's just a \"WTF wasted like 30 minutes for nothing, and now have to wait out a timer before i can try again?\"\n\nTried a federation game. Basically pointless, it takes away most of what little control you still had and gives little in return. (or maybe its worthwhile, but the game just fails to communicate the worth of this at all?)\n\nThe natural affinity is to play wide and capture as much land as possible. This is inherently neither good nor bad. But they want to make tall playstyles also viable, and much of what has been done to facilitate this just makes the game annoying. All sorts of arbitrary restrictions and debuffs for being successful.\n\nAchievements only work on ironman mode aka NO SAVING. Oh but even on fastest speed games take many hours, I'm sure this wont be a problem.\n\nThere is a lot of notification spam. Every little thing is a popup you have to stop and deal with. Many pause the game for you. Items such as \"random empires you have never heard about did something\" are as important as a scientist doing an expendition or a research finishing. There are thousands of popups each game.

Je pense en particulier aux personnes qui d\u00e9couvrent aujourd'hui le jeu et qui se voient bloqu\u00e9es par des dizaines de DLC qui devraient \u00eatre inclus dans le jeu de base \u00e0 ce stade, m\u00eame si l'option de l'abonnement est une solution c'est temporaire.\n\n- La qualit\u00e9 plus que discutable des derni\u00e8res mises \u00e0 jour.\nLe dernier DLC a ajout\u00e9 une \u00e9norme quantit\u00e9 de bugs et m\u00e9caniques \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 termin\u00e9es, il y a m\u00eame une qu\u00eate principale d'une des nouvelles origines qui \u00e9tait IMPOSSIBLE \u00e0 terminer, la qu\u00eate se bloquait toute seule. (je sais pas si ce bug est corrig\u00e9 aujourd'hui mais le fait qu'il n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rep\u00e9r\u00e9 pendant le d\u00e9veloppement en dit beaucoup sur le processus de d\u00e9veloppent des derniers DLC). \nEt c'est sans parler des m\u00e9caniques purement absentes: on a eu de quoi modifier g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement de la faune spatiale et aussi de quoi en faire des zombies avec deux m\u00e9caniques diff\u00e9rentes mais alors POURQUOI les deux m\u00e9caniques n\u2019interagissent pas ensemble? Pourquoi on ne peut pas modifier les zombies alors que les textes de lore du jeu laissent penser que c'est clairement possible?\nJe ne vais pas faire le tour de chaque probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s aux derni\u00e8res mises \u00e0 jour, \u00e7a serait trop long, mais vous comprenez o\u00f9 je veux en venir.\n\n- Les probl\u00e8mes d'optimisation.\nL\u00e0 c'est simple, le jeu n'est pas bien optimis\u00e9, les fins de parties sont exponentiellement plus lentes \u00e0 mesure que les diff\u00e9rents empires se d\u00e9veloppent. La mani\u00e8re dont les IA g\u00e8rent leurs flottes par exemple est une \u00e9norme source de lag.\nEt ou je sais ce que vous allez me dire \"prends un meilleur pc\" sauf que le jeu recommende pas plus que 4go de RAM et une vielle carte graphique pour le faire tourner, c'est pas avec mes 16go de RAM, une RTX 3060 et un plut\u00f4t bon proco que c'est cens\u00e9 lagger comme \u00e7a.\nLe truc c'est que les recommendations sont fait selon ce que le jeu consomme en d\u00e9but de partie, pas en fin, ce qui et syst\u00e9matiquement diff\u00e9rent dans les 4x, c'est le cas dans \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de jeux similaires comme CIV par exemple.\nDe plus ces probl\u00e8mes s'ajoutent \u00e0 un multijoueur tr\u00e8s instable ce qui rend l\u2019exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able entre les lags et les d\u00e9synchro.\n\n- IA G\u00e9n\u00e9rative.\nLE truc qui m'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 ne plus jouer au jeu, tous les autres d\u00e9fauts j'aurais pu les accepter, r\u00e2ler un peu mais pas au point de ne plus jouer du tout, mais l\u00e0 je c'est ma limite absolue.\nDans le dernier DLC les devs ont, selon la page de ce dernier, utilis\u00e9s une IA g\u00e9n\u00e9rative pour les aider dans leur processus cr\u00e9atif.\nLes IA g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives sont un \u00e9norme tas de probl\u00e8mes divers et vari\u00e9s sur tout un tas de sujet: \u00e9cologie, droits humains, respect des artistes, colonialisme etc...\nUtiliser, m\u00eame un tout petit peu, une IA g\u00e9n\u00e9rative volontairement c'est participer activement au probl\u00e8me, n'y voir qu'une excuse pour pondre du contenu payant plus rapidement encore (parce que oui, en 2024 il y a eu 3 DLC sur une tr\u00e8s courte p\u00e9riode, si vous vous demandiez comment \u00e7a a pu arriver vous savez maintenant).\nLes soucis techniques des derni\u00e8res mises \u00e0 jours sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette cadence acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e de d\u00e9veloppement et l'utilisation d'IA g\u00e9n\u00e9rative est une excuse pour cut toujours plus de temps de d\u00e9veloppement.\nDonc m\u00eame si vous en avez rien \u00e0 foutre de cramer la plan\u00e8te ou de pisser sur les droits humains, m\u00eame d'un point de vue purement \u00e9go\u00efste le fait que ce jeu utilise de l'IA g\u00e9n\u00e9rative vous donne un contenu moins bon.\n\nN'achetez pas ce jeu.\nIl y en a tout un tas d'autres qui font mieux ce que celui l\u00e0 pr\u00e9tend faire et qui respecte r\u00e9ellement ses joueurs.\n\nJe pr\u00e9cise que je garderais un oeil sur le jeu, si les devs font quelque chose pour changer leurs mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9velopper, si les probl\u00e8mes cit\u00e9s sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9s, peut \u00eatre que je retirerais cet avis n\u00e9gatif, cependant je ne me fait pas trop de faux espoirs.", "timestamp_created": 1737228711, "timestamp_updated": 1737229299, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988",

pull you into it and keep you playing for hours at a time; This is a game is great if you want to RP or if you want to min/max and win. The game is consistently supported with major updates, patches and DLCs with each x.0 update bringing massive changes that keep the game fresh. The modding community is also incredibly skilled, with many mods having incredibly high quality with a lot of passion put into them. (certainly better then the mods i see for civ 6)\r\nThe main issue that i take with the game is that the DLCs are numerous, expensive, lock out important features and are often of questionable quality, especially the non-mechanical DLCs, essentially all of them are very questionable, though thankfully the worst ones tend to not lock away mechanics. The performance of the game is quite poor late game, especially if you are modding but this is seeming to be getting some fixes in the 4.0 update so take that comment with a grain of salt once it comes out.\r\nI would rate the game 8/10, it is very fun and worth it if you enjoy grand strategy games, but the DLCs are a major issue", "timestamp_created": 1737222338, "timestamp_updated":

Addictive Space Micromanagement\r\n\r\nStellaris is the game where you start as a humble species with dreams of greatness, only to realize you're one wrong diplomatic choice away from being devoured by intergalactic bug monsters or enslaved by sentient AI. And honestly? I love it.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy is vast, the possibilities are endless, and so is the learning curve. Seriously, if you thought calculus was tough, wait until you're juggling fleet logistics, planetary management, trade routes, and the existential dread of accidentally awakening a Fallen Empire. But hey, that\u2019s half the fun! The other half is yelling at your screen when your \"trustworthy\" allies backstab you five minutes after signing a non-aggression pact.\r\n\r\nThe DLC? It\u2019s like an uncharted galaxy itself\u2014daunting and expensive. But when you catch a sale, it feels like you've just discovered a rich system full of energy credits. That said, Stellaris without DLC is still an incredible game, just one where you feel like you're eating pizza without all the toppings. Still good, but you know there\u2019s more out there.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you love spreadsheets, strategy, and the sheer chaos of trying to manage a galactic empire while wondering how the Blorg Friendship Force managed to outperform your military, this is your game. It's a glorious mix of \"just one more turn\" and \"wait, where did my fleet go?\"\r\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.7/10\r\nWould accidentally trigger an endgame crisis again.", "timestamp_created": 1736690457, "timestamp_updated": 1736690457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185439471": {"recommendationid": "185439471", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076453032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 146, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1737126165}, "language": "english", "review": "space hearts of iron", "timestamp_created": 1736690345, "timestamp_updated": 1736690345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185439380": {"recommendationid": "185439380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025168679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 20999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1210, "playtime_at_review": 19788, "last_played": 1737402789}, "language": "english", "review": "not much I can say that already hasnt been said about this game.

There is an automation feature, but it won't do what you want it to do because of inadequate customization. So you have a ton of tedious and pointless micromanagement or leave it up to vassal or planetary AI, which isn't ideal. They could include a planetary build templates feature, but they still haven't done so years later.\n\nInfluence is an arbitrary resource which overly constricts too many aspects of the game, from warfare to internal government. You can use a total war system which doesn't require influence, but that is arbitrarily locked behind late game planet killer technology. You need influence to do an ever increasing amount of actions, and yet you only get a small amount of influence which can't be significantly increased like the rest of your economy.\n\nThere are also a variety of annoying arbitrary limits. If your civilization has the resources to build multiple Dyson spheres, why shouldn't you be allowed to? Why can you only build a limited number of starbases?\n\nBesides the problems with the core game mechanics, the software itself is also quite buggy. On Windows 11 the game crashes constantly.

I definitely don't recommend buying this game unless it is on a major sale.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Achievements: in order to get achievements on Steam, you are forced to play in \"Ironman\" mode, where you cannot manually save the game to quit whenever you want. This is a huge deal to someone like me, who loves collecting achievements in games, and also because I need to step away from the computer quite often. This is by far the BIGGEST thing I dislike about this game.\r\n- DLC hell: there are too many DLC packs each costing a lot, even when there are discount sales it is still way too much in my opinion to fully collect every pack for this game.\r\n- Poorly designed tutorials: the tutorials are all written and while some have voice lines, they do not highlight what you are supposed to click on. I had to Google numerous different mechanics in order to figure out how to apply them as there were no highlighted visuals. Examples include how to create new sectors, how to figure out how to build observation posts, etc. As a visual learner, I would have preferred the tutorial highlight where these buttons are, rather than having to watch YouTube videos for more than 10 mins at a time to explain otherwise not so complex functions.\r\n- Difficulty levels on easiest mode not being easy: I noticed when playing the game on the easiest setting on both Ironman and regular modes, the system AI had NPC's with score in the 50k+ range and my best at 3rd place was 6-7k. I do not understand why the AI NPC's are so powerful in the victory count, especially on beginner difficulty! Not a fan.\r\n- Graphics not as good as store advertised: even zoomed in, space doesn't look that good, and you play most of the game zoomed out at max. Honestly underwhelming and not the best to look at, compared to other games where space is more detailed.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- I like the concept, and think if executed better it would be a great game for sure.\r\n- I got the base game on sale for under $10.\r\n- The designs of the different species are cool.\r\n\r\nOverall, I just am disappointed. In other city builders such as the Civilization series, the beginner difficulties don't have such overpowered AI, in addition to better tutorials and achievements can be earned in any mode and difficulty unless otherwise specified.

2114, "last_played": 1736465810}, "language": "english", "review": "Im not a 4X kinda guy but I've spent a few hundred hours in Civ 6 so I thought I would give this a go. It sucks. I didn't buy the DLC but I shouldn't need to. I gave this two legitimate tries but the same problems come up. Go get Civ 6, not because its great, but because it's free on Epic, and it's better than this trash.\n\nTo start, the game's tutorials just tell you that you can do something. Great. What would they affect? Who knows!? The only way to learn most things is by consulting a wiki. Is this large empire that is multiple hours of micromanagement away from me in terms of power important? Can I become their ally? Are they neutral? There is just no way to tell. What does this civic do? How do I research what I want from the tech tree? The game just doesn't tell you. You have to google the answer and find out that the tech tree isn't really a tree but a rotating set of options that are RANDOM. You also have to look up how to please certain empire types because depending on their ethics, they like or are open to different actions, none of which you can learn without looking it up first. \n\nSecond, the game is very unbalanced. sure, for a pro it might be too easy, but any game will be that way. The new player experience on default settings, choosing a default empire will lead them down a bad time. Why do 2 empires start with more research done than me? why do 2 OTHER empires start AT THE END OF THE TECH TREE. That's right, when you make a game on default settings two empires will start with every technology researched, and will be nearly impossible for a casual enjoyer of the game unless they know about them, and prepare for them from the first minute of the game. This then runs into the issue of the game not explaining what other empires like. One of the mega-empires can hate you for claiming a system near them(when the beginning of a game is nothing BUT a land-grab race for all empires), but the game doesn't let you know that, and as such they will obliterate you for trying. Then there is a timer on your game. Why a timer? Because the devs needed a way to challenge experienced players. There is something called \"the crisis\" that will destroy you unless you knew about it beforehand and prepared all game, much like the empires at the end of the tech tree would.\n\nThen there is the diplomacy system. I don't know how they managed it, but its even worse than Civ 6's. If you want to do ANYTHING productive, you need to have great relations with an empire. This is because all of your options, other than giving them free materials are not available unless you're on good relations with them. This also bleeds into combat, where declaring war makes you select a specific war goal, which NEEDS to be achieved to win. You have to somehow force the AI to surrender which it will never do, or after you go to war for a while you get something common in 4X games. War weariness. This happens during any combat for both sides. But in this game, once it hits 100%, YOU AUTO-ACCEPT A STATUS QUO. This means  the enemy can take your stars quickly at the start, get you to a 100% war exhaustion (because they took your stars), and as soon as you get a force capable of reclaiming those stars moved over to take them back, the other empire can force you to make peace and surrender them. The war wasn't over, the fighting didn't stop, and even if you had the strength to wipe out the enemies completely, because they attacked first and took undefended stars (of which you'll have a lot of because the map is huge), you are forced to give them up. This is so dumb I cannot believe that a whole company thought of this, said it was a good idea, and left it in the game for a decade. This seems like something in a prototype when you can't figure out any interesting war mechanics so you shove this garbage in there. Also the Galactic Federation is absolutely useless, as nearly all of the resolutions to vote on in the galactic senate mean absolutely nothing and change almost nothing. Most of the time, the empires proposing them don't even benefit from the proposed legislation so it doesn't make any sense on why they would propose it. I have even seen a large empire I was at war with propose a legislation that would increase the upkeep on military, and this bankrupted them and effectively removed them from the game, because they couldn't afford to make a new fleet after that.\n\nDon't even get me started on the gameplay decisions, there is only a single way to play the game! It's domination victory or nothing! There is culture, but past mid game, it can't even help you! And while the current ways to win the game would technically be considered science victories, they require you to dominate every other empire, because they will all turn on you once you go for the victories anyway. And the way battles work is horrible. It's literally just bigger number = win. Sometimes the win is so egregious that my 5k fleet will destroy a 4.9k fleet with no losses at all. This leads to the main strategy being to get a large deathball so the enemy you are fighting will always be too weak to take on your fleet and removes any sort of interesting plays you could make. This is made even worse by the map, which is a grid of stars that are connected, but only in certain directions. This leads to many obvious choke points which become impassible obstacles once you take the simple action of moving every military related thing to that choke point. Even the AI knows it can't beat you doing that and will mass fleets right next to the choke point, but if your number is larger than theirs, you just move out and kill them before their number is larger than yours, and they will never be able to field a large enough fleet to destroy you unless they started with one.\n\nFinally, for some reason, half the UI is also broken, and when you decide to do something the buttons just don't do anything. In the fleet manager, you can't design a fleet to be your ideal army. You have the option to copy a fleet, but not save one as a template to keep, so when the fleet dies, you have to make it from scratch, clicking in all the different ships you want to have 1-by-1, but if it doesn't die, you can do that automatically with the Copy Fleet button. Then there is districts on planets that only allow so many. Trying to add another will not let you, and it won't even disable the button, it just doesn't queue a district for you. The only way to know you are over in districts is to manually count them, or to hover over the little squares, where a popup will show the number of that type of district, then after 5 seconds of loading, show you your total distinct amount.\n\nThe sad fact that this came out in 2016 makes me wonder if video games will ever be decent again, because most of the systems in this game feel like placeholders, or half-implementations. It's a game that isn't even a mile wide but it's still only an inch deep. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736495612, "timestamp_updated": 1736495612, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43918919563293457", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185236828": {"recommendationid": "185236828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399293997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 4879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4879, "playtime_at_review": 4879, "last_played": 1736487016}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b83\u5dee\u4e00\u4e2aDLC\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u5c11\u4e86P2W\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u628a\u6b63\u5e38\u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u5bb9\u62c6\u51fa\u6765\u653eDLC\u91cc\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5dee\u4e86\u4e19DLC\u80fd\u8ba9\u7532DLC\u6b8b\u5e9f\u3001\u4e59DLC\u51faBug\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u6ca1\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u63a8\u8fdb\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u522b\u5177\u4e00\u683c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1736493595, "timestamp_updated": 1736493595, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185233213": {"recommendationid": "185233213", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032703304", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1862, "playtime_at_review": 7752, "last_played": 1736528295}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ce8\u610f\uff01\uff01\uff01Stellaris\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u52a0\u5feb\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\u901f\u7684\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u542f\u7528\u540e\u6781\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5feb\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\u901f\uff01\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e4b\u4f59\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u788e\u7247\u65f6\u95f4\u6e38\u73a9Stellaris\uff0c\u8bf7\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6e38\u73a9Stellaris\u65f6\u81f3\u5c11\u67094\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\uff01\u8bf7\u5c3d\u91cf\u907f\u514d\u5728\u7761\u524d\u6e38\u73a9Stellaris\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4f60\u7684\u7761\u7720\u9020\u6210\u6781\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff01\r\nWarning!!!

Eso da pie a que tengan unas tropas/defensas mucho mas fuertes de lo que deberia, incluso un jugador normal da la sensacion de que en ese estado no podria generar tantos recursos.\r\n\r\nSobre el tema de los recursos, para mi gusto est\u00e1 bien, tienes 4 o 5 principales y con eso puedes avanzar bastante en la partida, cuando quieras equipacion mejor has de desbloquear ciertos materiales que son mas escasos pero te permiten tener mas poder, eso es obvio, pero hablando desde un punto de vista de alguien que he llegado a tener una partida con media galaxia casi (dificultad reducida a la normal) no he podido generar tantos materiales de esos especiales como para que todas mis flotas est\u00e9n maxeadas, no se si lo hice mal pero no encontraba la forma de aumentar la produccion.\r\n\r\nSobre el tema de recursos ser\u00e9 breve, se consiguen principalmente con estaciones mineras en sistemas solares o con edificios especificos en planetas, bastante comodo para no tener que est\u00e1r pensando en donde buscarlos.\r\n\r\nSobre el tema de los planetas tengo un dilema de amor/odio, se nota que es el core del juego (opinion personal) son bastante complicados de estabilizar hasta que aprendes lo que significan xx numeros de estadisticas, para mi gusto falta algunos ajustes para poder visualizar mejor las cosas para no tener que darte cabezazos contra la mesa o tener que gastar muchas horas para acabar aprendiendolo, se puede hacer mas comoda la informacion, no obstante hay mods que lo permiten (por algo ser\u00e1 que la gente crea estos tipos de mods...) desgraciadamente si juegas con gente, todos han de tener los mismos mods activos, ni siquiera se pueden tener mods del lado [CLIENTE] ya que internamente cambia la version del juego y ya no te deja unirte a una partida lo cual lo veo bastante estupido ya que no provoca nada malo.\r\n\r\nEn general es un juego entretenido con un arte muy bonito y una gestion de recursos sencilla; siempre y cuando le dediques al menos 60h o 30h investigando y no jugando improvisando.\r\n\r\nLo recomiendo especialmente con el DLC de megaestructuras, paara mi gusto tiene la especie mente colmena que me est\u00e1 encantando. Con rebajas obvimente o en paginas de terceros :)\r\n\r\nTampoco recomiendo crear tu propio imperio personalizado pese a que parezca facil, a lo largo de la partida se te puede ir al traste completamente sin saber por que.\r\n\r\nCalculo que jugar\u00e9 otras 150-250h antes de necesitar un par\u00f3n grande del juego.", "timestamp_created": 1736281988, "timestamp_updated": 1736281988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185046735": {"recommendationid": "185046735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856453511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 38669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 835, "playtime_at_review": 37851, "last_played": 1737404494}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite game ever, if you have the time and money, and like grand strategy games, this one is a masterpiece, if youre a new player for the non discount price of 40 euros youll have 50 to 100 hours of fun gameplay, then learn the game basics and realise 90% of the fun stuff from trailers is locked away in DLCs.

Este jogo tamb\u00e9m recebe constantemente atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es de corre\u00e7\u00e3o de bugs e balanceamento, o que faz a comunidade tender a ficar mais engajada, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bem otimizado.\nMas \u00e9 claro que nem tudo s\u00e3o flores, ent\u00e3o vou falar alguns pontos negativos: O jogo \u00e9 muito caro, ent\u00e3o pegue em uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o que ai sim vai valer muito a pena. Outro, muitas dlcs interessantes mas muito caras e divididas em v\u00e1rias. Ele \u00e9 obviamente nichado devido aos outros pontos que eu disse acima, o que torna ele muito bom, mas ao mesmo tempo dif\u00edcil de convencer algum amigo a jogar ou encontrar uma partida, mas \u00e9 claro que voc\u00ea pode jogar singleplayer sem problema. \nE por \u00faltimo, pode ser dif\u00edcil de aprender a jogar, o tutorial ajuda e h\u00e1 v\u00e1rios f\u00e3s que disponibilizam dicas e guias, mas ainda assim pode ser complicado compreender tudo. Por\u00e9m nenhum aspecto e mec\u00e2nica do jogo parece exagero e todos fazem sentido, faz voc\u00ea passar o tempo e tamb\u00e9m exercitar os neur\u00f4nios que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 n\u00e3o usa pra nada mesmo.

I've seen it gain somewhat of a reputation for it being HOI4 in space with a crowd that's just as bad. I really wish people wouldn't see it that way.\n\nAs fun as playing like that is (I'm guilty of it), there's so much more to do. My current save is playing as a custom empire which is basically the Flood from Halo. I'm basically roleplaying as mindless creatures who infect everything they see and attack on sight. Admittedly that probably feeds into the issue I mentioned BUT, my last save \nwas far more interesting and tame. \n\nI roleplayed as a civilization that went through a brutal civil war and was \"saved\" by a prophet of sorts and ascended into ultra-religious and biologically advanced beings. I even wrote that in my empire's lore (Yes, there's a custom lore section but it's more for fun than anything). I then kept getting contacted by the \"prophet\" until I explored a wormhole in my home system that transported me to a an empire long forgotted to time which turned out to be where the prophet was from and they congratulated me on coming to find them while telling me they were watching over me the whole time. Then I ended up in a really bad war which could've led to the complete erasure of my empire. BUT MY OVERLORDS HELPED ME AND FOUGHT FOR MY SURVIVAL. We held celebrations on every planet I owned and we made it a national holiday (celebrate it or GET OUT). \n\nThere's so much to do in the game. If you're not the roleplay type and you just want to start and play whatever, you don't even have to. Just make a nation that fits what you wanna do and then you're free to play how you want. The game even gives you premade options for nations to start as if you don't wanna do that.\n\nI advise starting with the \"Starter Edition\" since it comes with neat DLC addons. If you like the game then you could start getting DLC but there's like $250 worth so try not to spend all your money in one place. I got the Ultimate Bundle during the Christmas sale for $100.

3 bucks. That being i've never spent more money on a game either, even with the sale i paid almost 200 bucks to have all the dlcs and everything. I do understand the gripes about dlcs and pricing but i dont understand how a lot of people balk at the price tag but will also drop that amount and more on their phone plan each month just to have the newest shiny phone. Given that i will be playing this probably the rest of my life, i'd say the value is worth it and so far i havent been dissapointed one bit. That doesnt change from the fact that game studios are getting greedy af though. its an amazing game but i feel like the price tag and tons of paid dlcs splits the playerbase up and makes it harder for some people to even get into the game.

(I\u2019ll list my DLC below.)\n\nIn a nutshell, the game is an RTS RPG 4X strategy game. Your perspective is not explicitly outlined, but it is somewhat like you are an artificial intelligence that oversees high-level decisions for your civilization. You give ship orders, direct what planets to colonize, manage the economy, take action against threats, and make choices at key decision points.\n\nFor low-level management, you assign leaders to various positions like ship captains and planetary governors. The length of your game will encompass centuries, so leaders will suffer attrition from retirement or death. (This is why I describe your role as being like a guiding artificial intelligence, since leaders die of old age, but not you.)\n\nIndividual leaders have particular skills that influence where you assign them, and though they can learn new skills over their careers, they can sometimes develop negative traits. (Only a couple times did I find it necessary to reassign a leader to make their negative trait irrelevant.)\n\nThe mechanics have depth that you will be feeling your way through as you play. When there was something in particular that I needed to understand, either Reddit or YouTube had an answer for me.\n\nOverall, the manner of expansion and exploration feels much like being within a Star Trek universe. You need science vessels to survey systems before you can claim them. So, I found it useful to have multiple science vessels, one for each direction of expansion, with one extra ship for analyzing anomalies.\n\nAs you develop trade routes, pirates can become an issue that need to be suppressed using your fleets. However, rather than involve my main fleets, I found that having several small flights of ships were effective when patrolling trade route sections.\n\nMy Stellaris DLC:\n\t\u2022 Utopia\n\t\u2022 Apocalypse\n\t\u2022 Leviathans Story Pack\n\t\u2022 Synthetic Dawn Story Pack\n\t\u2022 Distant Stars Story Pack\n\t\u2022 Ancient Relics Story Pack\n\t\u2022 First Contact Story Pack\n\t\u2022 Humanoids Species Pack", "timestamp_created": 1736021671, "timestamp_updated": 1736021671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184769291": {"recommendationid": "184769291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013773288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 794, "deck_playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1736019446}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who has played thousands of hours of other Paradox games, namely EU4/CK3/V3, this game feels familiar yet very different. I find the early-mid game fun and engaging, exploring and surveying, uncovering the mysteries of the universe is a great way to spend a few hours. At this point though most of the universe is controlled by you and AI empires. \r\n\r\nThis is when the game starts to suck. Diplomacy is bare bones, limited to options such as trade, defensive pact, knowledge share etc. The AI empires don't feel very alive or interesting. Federations and the galactic community don't add much in the way of interest either, just different user interfaces for much the same things as before. \r\n\r\nWar is where things really take a nose dive though. Space battles on an individual level are fine and the combat animations are nice enough. But warfare is one element of the game without any automation, so when you are at war with several empires, be prepared to click a thousand times to move your fleet around. Often painfully chasing other fleets, which feels like a slug chasing a snail. \r\n\r\nI should add that I only have the base game without any DLC. This is the only Paradox game I havent purchased from the beginning, which means I'd have to spend several hundred dollars to get content which could make the game worthwhile. But as we know, games shouldn't have to be hundreds of dollars to be enjoyable. \r\n\r\nI don't recommend this game and I don't recommend the Paradox way of locking content behind paywalls.", "timestamp_created": 1736020311, "timestamp_updated": 1736020311, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184767074": {"recommendationid": "184767074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159088073", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1302, "last_played": 1735945682}, "language": "spanish", "review": "GOZ", "timestamp_created": 1736018612, "timestamp_updated": 1736018612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184766155": {"recommendationid": "184766155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028491252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2583, "last_played": 1735863449}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game, steep learning curve", "timestamp_created": 1736017873, "timestamp_updated": 1736017873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511627912521362305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184765591": {"recommendationid": "184765591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071734067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 6469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1846, "playtime_at_review": 3929, "last_played": 1737221614}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

"review": "This felt like one of those movies that started out really great, but halfway through gets derailed... and you keep with it because the first half had such promise... but then it never delivers and you're left disappointed.\n The first part of the game was great. Exploring around and claiming new systems, watching the border of your civilization grow in increments. The feeling of urgency, trying outrace the other civilizations for claim on this or that. Developing your research, and building your fleets. It was exciting finding new planets that were habitable, and sending colony ships to establish new worlds. There was this great feeling that it was all leading somewhere.\nAfter borders are established, you find yourself asking, \"Hmmm, what now?\" This isn't a problem for too long, as there is diplomacy to consider, colonies to develop, ships to design, fleets to build, outposts to be fortified. It's all leading up to something...\n\nFrom diplomacy to trading this game claims to have it all. except after about 25 hours you'll realize it offers all these things at the most superficial level. Here's Diplomacy: You can improve relations, which doesn't really do anything except make them willing to trade, or maybe eventually become your vassal. Sounds cool, right? Except they never want to trade resources on a monthly basis, which eliminates the usefulness of diplomacy altogether. You can do individual trades, where I'll give you X of this for X of that, but it's absolutely tedious to do so. When you're dealing with over 20k units of a resources, it would be nice to be able to just type into the text field \"20000\". Nope. You gotta sit there and click to increase the amount by 100 at a time. So, if you want to trade 20k energy credits for X amount of dark matter, you have to sit there and click, click, click, click. And that's just for once resource in the trade. Say you want to trade 5 or 6 different things.. Click, click, click.. The whole process makes trading so tedious, and half the time I'm just trying to get rid of resources or gain favor with whoever I'm trading with.\nExcept gaining favor doesn't matter. It benefits you in no way to gain favor with other civilizations. Doesn't offer you resources. They can become your vassal, except if they do it literally doesn't affect you at all. You don't get access to their resources, and if you do... or something does happen... it's not obvious to the point that a first time player would notice.\nAnd that's what you begin to realize after 40 hours. Nothing you do outside of managing your resources really matters. You uplifted a species into sentience? Cool. It doesn't affect anything except you get to read some pop-ups about their progress. If it adds a new race to your civilization, I didn't notice. By 40 hours I had tons of different species roaming around. But here's the thing: I had no sense of that. There's all this stuff supposedly happening, but no visual representation of it actually happening. I know that's probably too much to ask for in a simulation of this scope, but my mind goes to games like roller coaster tycoon or Theme park, or even Sim City and Rimworld, where you can SEE the progress you're making, you can see the little models roaming around your creation. Here you can't tell what your pops are doing... how they're living... it's all just a few words of text that left me feeling disconnected and dispassionate about what I was building.\n\nIt was just a bunch of symbols on a world map, and numbers corresponding to your resources. And the resource mechanics, while not difficult to balance, aren't exactly clear either. You build a new district or building, but the effects don't immediately take place. They go up after a \"tic\" or two. When you have about 20 different colonies to manage, and all types of buildings and districts are going up at once, it's hard to gauge exactly how resources will fluctuate. Sometimes i'd see drastic changes, once having a massive surplus and the next operating at a deficit. Sure, I could have paid more attention to all the details of upkeep and how much this or that costs... but there seriously is information overloading going on, and at some point you just want to get on with it. After a while I felt like I wasn't playing an empire simulator, but rather just an economy simulator. Constantly jumping between screens to build this or that.\nAnd that's another thing that started to drive me nuts after a while. You can't unpause the game for longer than 5 seconds without being overwhelmed by notifications. You get pinged with a new notification so often that it's nearly impossible to focus on the task at hand. You're constantly distracted by something, and it left me feeling like I'd forgotten something, or something else needed tending to. \n\nSo diplomacy is hollow... that leaves us with war, right?  Surely spending a couple hours designing many different ship loadouts with all the fancy new toys I researched ought to lead to some fun, right? So now let's pick a fight with my belligerent neighbor who keeps talking smack.  I waged war on him, completely overwhelming his puny ship designs with my superior fleet. I took system after system, eventually subjugating the rude birds under my rule.  Sounds fun, right? Not really. Here's combat in Stellaris: You spend several weeks or months of game time moving your fleets into position. You fan the flames of politics to justify the war... and then you launch your shock and awe campaign.\nThat first battle, I didn't know what to expect when I moved my fleet into range of the enemies fleet. The numbers representing the strength of their fleet were pitiful compared to my own, but still I was nervous. I had no idea how to command my corvettes, frigates, and destroyers. would it be like homeworld? 3d fuzzballs of spacewar mayhem?  Nope. 2d, and while visually cool, there was nothing more to it than watching a bunch of ships fly around zapping each other with light and missiles. Coulnd't tell who was who, and there was absolutely no input from me aside from a decision to retreat or not.  All it was was watching the numbers of the respective fleets go down until one was left standing.\n\nSome will say that Stellaris was never designed to be tactical, and it's more of a strategy game. I kind of get their point... but the problem isn't even that it's not tactical, or player involved enough, it's that you can't even tell what's going on.\n\nAll the time I spent designing all kinds of ships, and I couldn't even tell which one was performing in action. I couldn't pick one out from the other, and had no idea what sort of effect each loadout was making on the battlefield. You know how you think something might work on paper, but in practice its totally different? You can't tell if that's the case here. You just load up your different ships however you want, but at the end it just equates to numbers on a screen, and you have no idea which weapons or combinations of weapons are performing effectively or not.\n\nSo, combat was definitely a flop. And the strategic side of the war wasn't really fun either. Just keep a fleet stationed in differect sectors of your domain. No real strategic thought to it whatsoever, except where to attack next. \n\nON top of that, keeping your ships upgraded is absolutely tedious.  As soon as you re-outfit your entire fleet, a new upgrade comes along that requires you to go in and redesign all your ships--AGAIN.  And again. and again... and then your ships gotta go to a shipyard to get outfitted... so plan your wars around your next upgrade.  It's just tedious and annoying... altogether.. without even the benefit of a payoff.  Personally I think adding an option to fight a tactical battle or autoresolve could save this game, and then have some total war warhammer type battles, or battlefleet gothic style, or even homeworld style.

vorstellen kann.\nAllein die Erstellung der eigene Spezies, ist ein Traum f\u00fcr alle Scifi Fans. Du kannst nahezu jede Art von Volk erstellen was man so aus anderen Universen kennt. Nen brutales Terranisches Empire aller Warhammer, die komischen Parasit\u00e4ren Weltraumschlanngen aus Star Gate, eine Wohlwollende F\u00f6deration wie aus Star Trek. Oder lieber die Assimilierenden Borg?\nNen alles verschlingender Schwarm wie die Zerg, aus Starcraft, oder Tyraniden aus Warhammer?\nEs gibt quasi kaum grenzen.\n\nDie Diplomatie ist auch ziemlich gut, ich kann ganze Reiche standartm\u00e4ssig erobern, mit ihnen zusammen verschiedene Arten der F\u00f6deration gr\u00fcnden, oder sie per Diplomatie ganz in mein Reich einverleiben.\nVieleicht werd ich aber auch selbst einfach zu Galaxy vernichtenden Krise, oder zum Retter eben jeder vor dieser.\n\nAlso was das Spiel an sich angeht, geht der Daumen ganz klar nach oben, und es w\u00fcrde von mir ne 1+ bekommen m\u00fcsste ich in Schulnoten Urteilen.\n\n\nGanz gro\u00dfes Minuspunkt ist allerdings die Performance im Endgame. Das Game l\u00e4uft auch bei gro\u00dfen/Riesigen Glaxykarten (welche mir wegen der KI Viefalt halt am meisten Spa\u00df machen) traumhaft. Im Endgame, wenn dann die Flotten gr\u00f6\u00dfer werden, und die KI anf\u00e4ngt Habbitate zu spamen, und die Megastructuren zunehmen....geht das gelagge los.\nIn Friedenszeiten noch ertragbar, wird das ganze bei gro\u00dfen Kriegen durch Krisen fast unspielbar und zu nem reinen Lagfest.\nIch gehe auch nicht von aus das es an meinem Rechner liegt, weil er die empfohlenen Anforderungen noch \u00fcbertrifft, und bei anderen Spielen nicht so einbricht. Sondern einfach davon das es im Endgma einfach zuviel wird was da berechnet werden muss.\n\nAlso: +++ f\u00fcrs Spiel an sich, -- f\u00fcr die Performance (nur im Endgame),", "timestamp_created":

Why?\n\n1. Performance. This game is 8 years old but it still runs slowly. The coding was not done with optimization in mind at all. It should be fast.\n\n2. Event results are important and opaque. They're not shown or easy to guess. This favors people who look them up online or memorized them. That's bad game design.\n\n3. Too many shallow systems. You can design your own ships, but it's just putting the latest researched things in a few slots. You can manage planet economies, but all the incentives are towards dedicating each world to 1 resource type, so just do that.\n\n4. Too much accumulation of tiny bonuses. +5% here, +10% here, sure it adds up, but the bonuses barely affect strategy. Instead of making the player want to do something different, they just average out into gradual overall improvements, with each individual bonus being forgettable.\n\n5.

It's that once you've played 10 minutes of a paradox game you have more or less the broad experience of any of them. Queue up research, queue up buildings, turn on 4x speed and then wait for something to happen. It's not even that the waiting is particularly long or intolerable, it's just the fact it's the neutral state of the game, especially once you're efficient at setting up and automating early game. Sometimes nothing really interesting happens for minutes at a time and so it's hard to really review a game play loop that consists of around 50% waiting because whether everything else is worth the investment is almost wholly predicated on your tolerance for waiting. I tolerate it fine, but not a single friend I've gotten it for has been able to sit through even half a campaign. You're either the target demo or you're not and if you don't know if you are, you're probably not.  \n\nTwo, the other reason it's hard to review a paradox game is because infamously for their products about half of the game is scattered across ~40 DLC, making an accurate portrayal hard to nail down. Do I review only the base game even though that hasn't been my experience for years? Do I review the game in its entirety and give a complete view even if it means using the DLC packs I don't recommend? Or do I only talk about the ones I think are good and just let you figure out the rest? Which one of these is even the 'real' Stellaris?  It's easy to mislead people into thinking they'll necessarily have the same experience as I am describing out of the box, only to be disappointed when the space dragons are from a dlc, so I need to make sure I mention that. When I start needing to make a spreadsheet just to discuss the game to make sure I'm not lying to people about its content, I think that's another point against recommending it to people outside the community.\n\nNow my issue isn't that the DLC exists, I get it, you can't have large company with shareholders and lots of employees update a complicated game in perpetuity for absolutely free, that's just not the real world as much as we wish it was. My issue is a combination of the volume, age, and price of the DLC working against the players. There is a lot of ancient DLC that adds features that other DLC later built off of, like Megacorp. I can't actually imagine playing without Megacorp, because in addition to adding mechanics the game feels absolutely naked without, it simultaneously adds value to other DLCs; e.x. Buy the necroids species and you get a unique civic for a corporate death cult. There's plenty of interactions like that and I would like the fact that old content kept adding value to new content... if Megacorp wasn't also still for sale separately too. And still $20- half the price of the entire base game. For an expansion that's 6 years old. It sucks too because now the newer DLC, instead of getting to build off the assumption of the older DLC , it ends up actually having ADDITIONAL pay-walled options instead of extra value. Instead of being a cute interaction, it's a double pay walled civic perk for $30 - you need BOTH to use it and it's not even a good one. It's really just unacceptable that 5+ year old DLC haven't been rolled into the base game, I refuse to believe whatever they'd lose on 'new' sales is more than what they're already losing by maintaining this impenetrable money wall that keeps out perspective players and pisses off older ones until they stop spending. \n\nEven if you want to argue that age doesn't depreciate the value of DLC (I disagree), then you still have to contend with the fact the volume of the DLC is a nightmare for anyone new or curious about the game - and that's not good for growing or even maintaining the player base. It's approaching an on-boarding cost that is simply unreasonable for anyone but true Dire Whales, and I do not believe Stellaris is the type of game to hold a Genshin tier whale pod that'll keep it afloat, it's just not that type of game. I started playing Stellaris shortly after it came out, I bought only the DLC I wanted as they came out and never felt salty about spending $10 or $20 once or sometimes twice a year to support a game I'm still enjoying. But anyone playing now has to purchase this entire back catalog - and if they want the same experience they need to buy years of DLC all at the same time instead of getting to space it out over years like I did to make the price tag easier to swallow. Sure, you don't NEED it, but that loops back around to, well, that's like half the features of the game. Maybe the review you read didn't mention that the one thing you wanted to try out is one of those DLC features - so now you have to do research before you buy it to make sure you're getting the experience you want. It's a mess of a purchasing decision that adds layers of complication it doesn't need as if TRYING to scare people away from spending money on it. It's truly baffling. If you have to choose between spending $300 on a full game or $30 on half a game, I feel like most are going to rightly choose \"buy something else entirely\". And I honestly think they're right to. \n\n(I will not address the subscription because I don't want to encourage it)\n\nI waffled a lot on whether to ultimately give it a thumbs up or down because at the end of the day I do enjoy the game. I still put 8 hours into a new campaign every few months and I enjoy doing it.

I'd see promotions for it but couldn't wrap my head around what it is.  It wasn't until I tried Crusader Kings 3 that I realized Paradox's unique style and approaches to games.  (Which can be good and bad but more on that later.)  Stellaris is a strategy game in spirit of the Civilization series.  You basically take control of a stellar empire and try to build your way up in the galaxy,.  Much like the Civ series, there are multiple paths to a victory and even if you lose, you can still keep playing after someone is declared the victor.  Once you wrap your head around the formula, it's pretty fun. \n\nSo the good? Stellaris is an excellent strategy game.  There are loads of technologies, civics, ethics and more in the game.  The models and graphics all look good for what it is.  The music is stellar (ha!) and keeps you in the mood while in a long marathon session.  I really enjoy the politics in the game and the depth of the technology trees. \n\nThe bad: The most common complaint of any Paradox game is the DLC.  If you look at it from the standpoint of buying the game and waiting to buy the DLC somewhere down the line during a steam sale, it isn't so bad. But much like the Sims, jumping into the series after the release of like 15 DLCs is daunting and expensive. Luckily, they released the monthly subscription pack that while optional, gives you access to all the DLC.  I like it in ways because sometimes you may not be playing it as much so you can always cancel it.  \n\nOverall: I am really enjoying the game. I had a few weeks off for Christmas break from work.  I got Indiana Jones on gamepass for PC. Played a little bit of it and ended up back on Stellaris for 3 days in a row instead. (not a knock, Indiana Jones is fun but I guess I ended up preferring to play Stellaris.) Here's hoping for many more hours. Oh, did I mention the mods? Paradox games are often mod friendly.

Then the DLC too. I disagree with the price of the DLC when its not on sale - the value isn't ideal, especially when you can get the mods for free. but the quality of the DLC is solid.

parere riguardo questo prodotto.\nSemplicemente top, un capolavoro, un gioco sia strategico che geopolitico, che concerne la gestione di uno stato spaziale in ogni singolo aspetto di esso.\nHo giocato tanto alla modalit\u00e0 giocatore singolo, che personalmente trovo molto divertente in quanto l'IA \u00e8 abbastanza avanzata e sa muoversi bene da sola, rendendo la sfida abbastanza complessa e costringendo il giocatore ad intraprendere la via della diplomazia, la quale quasi sempre \u00e8 la miglior soluzione.\nNonostante ci\u00f2, ho giocato in egual misura alla modalit\u00e0 online in primis, e non appena \u00e8 stata rilasciata anche alla modalit\u00e0 cooperativa, che trovo sia una spettacolare aggiunta, in grado di portare tanto divertimento per le persone che vogliono giocare utilizzando la stessa nazione galattica; nonostante ci\u00f2, ogni tanto quest'ultima modalit\u00e0 \u00e8 affetta da diversi desync che iniziano ad avvenire una volta raggiunta la met\u00e0 della partita.\nIn qualunque caso, la modalit\u00e0 online mi ha insegnato ancora di pi\u00f9 le tattiche migliori da attuare in partita per superare la concorrenza degli altri stati, infatti giocare insieme ad uno o pi\u00f9 amici pu\u00f2 essere un grande vantaggio in questo prodotto, incoraggiando il lavoro di squadra e l'apprendimento imparando l'uno dall'altro le meccaniche di questo gioco che rimane uno dei giochi pi\u00f9 complessi che io abbia mai giocato (in generale, la complessit\u00e0 \u00e8 una caratteristica dei giochi di Paradox, come per Hearts of Iron IV e Crusader Kings III)\nGli sviluppatori rilasciano continui aggiornamenti e dlc, i quali purtroppo sono per la maggior parte a pagamento, ed il quale prezzo di un singolo dlc talvolta risulta esagerato, ma in qualunque caso la variet\u00e0 delle meccaniche del gioco \u00e8 in costante sviluppo, quindi troverete sempre nuove cose da fare per gestire il vostro stato al meglio.\nNonostante tutto, consiglio questo gioco in tutta la sua completezza.", "timestamp_created": 1735520211, "timestamp_updated": 1735520211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

But I'm sorry.... every game that you cant buy as any kind of Complete Edition for $50\u20ac at least a few years after release is pure scam. For $100\u20ac you can buy dozens of games with much more variety of gameplay. Fresher ideas and more depth. This game is now almost 9years old.\n\nThink about this:\n\nThe original game with all its game mechanics, visuals, sounds, engine, ideas from the concept stage to it being polished and ready for sale is $4\u20ac now.  \n\nSome of the DLC was ready when the original game shipped. Some was in different stages of development other ideas existed already.  Everything else that came after it is probably less complicated to do than the initial game yet costs 30x more. And some of it is based on community ideas too so not even their own intellectual creation.\n\n\n\nSame reason why e.g. a SuperSmashBros on Switch for $50\u20ac with 50 fighters and 50 stages that incluces the whole game enginge, graphics, sounds, menu, netcode etc....  is a steal compared to a single fighter with a stage that costs $5\u20ac.    \n\nThere is no way DLC is worth what people demand for it. And at that point every developer loses (and should lose) every customer that has at least a minimum amount of self respect.\n\nIf this game will ever be \"PAY $50\u20ac and you will get everything that exists and will ever exist.\" Then I will buy it.  Making games is easier than it ever was especially with A.I now.\n\nI am writing this because I would like to play the content yes. I already said I liked the original game.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Von der ersten Sekunde an wird man in eine faszinierende und unendliche Galaxie katapultiert, in der jede Entscheidung, die man trifft, weitreichende Konsequenzen hat. Das Hauptspiel bietet bereits eine beeindruckende Grundlage an M\u00f6glichkeiten, unterschiedlichen Rassen und komplexen Mechaniken, die die Neugier und den Entdeckerdrang wecken. Doch die wahre Pracht entfaltet sich erst mit den zahlreichen DLCs, die bis 2024 erschienen sind.\n\nDie Vielfalt der Reiche und Spezies, die man erstellen kann, ist einfach \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigend. Jede Entscheidung, ob es sich um die Auswahl einer Spezies, die Wahl des Regierungssystems oder die strategische Ausrichtung der Forschung handelt, f\u00fchrt zu einem einzigartigen Spielerlebnis. Die verschiedenen DLCs, wie \"Distant Stars\", \"Federations\", \"Nemesis\" und \"Overlord\", erweitern das Gameplay auf bemerkenswerte Weise. Besonders \"Federations\" bringt eine neue Dimension der Diplomatie und des politischen Spiels ins Geschehen, w\u00e4hrend \"Distant Stars\" mit aufregenden Erz\u00e4hlstr\u00e4ngen und Geheimnissen punktet, die das Erkunden der Galaxie noch spannender machen.\n\nDie Musik ist ein weiteres Highlight von Stellaris. Der mitrei\u00dfende Soundtrack untermalt die Epik des Spiels und sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass man sich tief in die Atmosph\u00e4re der intergalaktischen Abenteuer hineinziehen l\u00e4sst. Die Kombination aus futuristischen Kl\u00e4ngen und majest\u00e4tischen Melodien schafft eine immersive Erfahrung, die das Spiel noch unvergesslicher macht.\n\nEin weiterer Pluspunkt ist der hohe Wiederspielwert. Jedes Spiel gestaltet sich anders, sei es durch die Wahl einer neuen Spezies, das Ausloten anderer Strategien oder das Eingehen auf verschiedene Ereignisse und Geschichten, die sich w\u00e4hrend der Erkundung entfalten. Man findet sich oft in neuen, unerwarteten Situationen wieder, die einen dazu anregen, immer wieder neue Ans\u00e4tze auszuprobieren.\n\nAllerdings ist zu beachten, dass Stellaris eine gewisse Komplexit\u00e4t mit sich bringt. Die Vielzahl an Mechaniken und Strategien erfordert, dass man sich intensiv mit dem Spiel auseinandersetzt, um das volle Potenzial auszusch\u00f6pfen. Doch genau diese Herausforderung macht das Spiel so lohnenswert. Wenn man erst einmal den Dreh raus hat, wird man belohnt mit einem tiefgr\u00fcndigen und fesselnden Erlebnis.\n\nInsgesamt ist Stellaris ein herausragendes Spiel, das durch seine Vielfalt, das durchdachte Design der Reiche und die packenden Geschichten besticht. Mit den DLCs wird das Gameplay kontinuierlich erweitert und bereichert. Wer bereit ist, sich in die komplexe, aber faszinierende Welt von Stellaris zu vertiefen, wird mit unz\u00e4hligen Stunden voller Freude und Entdeckungen belohnt.

O jogo possibilita a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de federa\u00e7\u00e3o, seja com fins de pesquisa ou guerra. Sistema de vassalagem e dominio de territ\u00f3rio. Sua civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7a com as configura\u00e7\u00f5es de esp\u00e9cie e tra\u00e7os de governo estipulados pelo jogador, antes do in\u00edcio da partida, permitindo um foco maior na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de naves com desconto, ou explora\u00e7\u00e3o de itens. IA bem agressiva, que tende sempre a tentar cercar o jogador e impedir a expans\u00e3o, \"estrangulando\" o seu progresso pelo mapa estelar nos sistemas interconectados. H\u00e1 algumas diferen\u00e7as por esp\u00e9cie e planeta, que fazem a an\u00e1lise do terreno e buffs de constru\u00e7\u00e3o uma op\u00e7\u00e3o sensata antes de uma aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de territ\u00f3rio. A IA age r\u00e1pido e de forma implac\u00e1vel, fazendo com que se necessite pausar algumas vezes, ou diminuir o fluxo de passagem do tempo para uma boa olhada no imp\u00e9rio do jogador, a fim de impedir d\u00e9ficit de recursos ou poss\u00edveis revoltas das colonias desamparadas. Todas as naves podem ser customizadas com seus tipos de armas, conforme o desbloqueio da pesquisa. Os l\u00edderes funcionam como her\u00f3is da civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, propiciando bonus de acordo com a escolha do jogador. Jogo divertido de jogar com amigos pacientes, que queiram aprender a gerenciar a partida e que saibam seguir dicas dos jogadores mais experientes. Qualquer um que tenha jogado e n\u00e3o recomenda esse jogo, possivelmente se frustrou pela expectativa de um Age of Empires ou jogos simples de estrat\u00e9gia de guerra, quando na verdade este jogo cresceu muito mais com as DLCs constantes, que rechearam o jogo de possibilidades e o tornou um jogo muito mais complexo do que simplesmente coletar madeira e carne e criar um soldado que bate no inimigo. A perda de naves e necessidade de reparo e escolha de um comandante de frota, remete aos antigos jogos de Star Trek Armada. Vale a pena jogar. O jogo base \u00e9 caro, assim como as DLCs, ent\u00e3o sugiro aguardar uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o que v\u00e1 at\u00e9 70 reais aproximadamente, lembrando que somente um jogador (Host da partida) precisa ter todas as DLCs, para que os demais players possam jogar o conte\u00fado completo. Tenho 697 horas jogadas no momento desta an\u00e1lise e s\u00f3 consegui completar a cole\u00e7\u00e3o depois de anos de jogo. Vale a pena aproveitar as promo\u00e7\u00f5es, que nesse momento est\u00e3o com 90% no jogo base(R$14,39) e 50% nas DLCs.

No game has come close in engaging my imagination, focus, and creativity. I love the feeling of creating my own space opera (dune, star wars, etc), learning the interwoven systems that make the simulation feel so believable, and pondering my next move as I go about my day. If you at all loved imagining what the rest of the Star Wars, Dune, or Star Trek universes were doing as the main story went on, you'll find so much joy and excitement in Stellaris. Words fail me! I love this game!\n\nThe continuous bug fixes, reworks of old broken systems, and mostly great DLC makes me feel so relieved and happy that Stellaris will have a long life and will go down in history as the gold standard for the genre. I own all the DLC and have definitely gotten my money's worth, especially since they continuously update and fix older content!\n\nThere is no genre of video games as rewarding as the grand strategy / simulation ones. If you are at all intimidated by Stellaris but still curious - the game can be played as slowly as you'd like, and is meant to be enjoyed over the course of days and weeks, rather than crammed into a late weekend night. Just launch the game and start as the humans, and just let yourself play it for a short while each day as the week goes on. Your brain will retain and learn new things each night. Stellaris, along with Crusader Kings 3, are the most beginner friendly of the paradox / grand strategy games out there!", "timestamp_created": 1735328580, "timestamp_updated": 1735328580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533783197402954102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183907593": {"recommendationid": "183907593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299918476", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 576, "playtime_at_review": 17958, "last_played": 1736901137}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, but does have a learning curve.

Small indie company cannot afford to update basic functionality and mechanics, but can afford to release 999 dlcs (and I am talking not only about Stellaris).\n\nI love the game, and community is one of the most active in game industry (Paradox community overall), but Paradox lost any kind of respect to their fellow consumers long time ago, and that is very sad, because their games are unique, there are no adequate alternatives. Thanks god for people who make mods, with them it is possible to fix most of the problems.", "timestamp_created": 1735269668, "timestamp_updated": 1736261713, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508292198181152344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183835595": {"recommendationid": "183835595", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230125372", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 578, "playtime_at_review": 1066, "last_played": 1736636694}, "language": "english", "review": "space :D", "timestamp_created": 1735268126, "timestamp_updated": 1735268126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183835474": {"recommendationid": "183835474", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179590241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1735337834}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Age Expansion Simulator\r\nAutism Edition", "timestamp_created": 1735268028, "timestamp_updated": 1735268028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183834870": {"recommendationid": "183834870", "author": {"steamid": "76561199760966012", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1064, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1737017615}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\uff0c\u8d8a\u73a9\u8d8a\u4e0a\u5934", "timestamp_created": 1735267555, "timestamp_updated": 1735267555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183830851": {"recommendationid": "183830851", "author": {"steamid": "76561199548983429", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1734760958}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6839\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u5bf9\u300a\u7fa4\u661f\u300b\uff08Stellaris\uff09\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff1a\n\n1. **\u6e38\u620f\u7279\u8272\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6**\uff1a\n   -

The complete edition is now on sale for $125, $280 being the original price.\r\n\r\nThe game without DLC's is just barren and boring, most new people will end up losing interest in the game without ever even finishing their first campaign. And if they don't, they will on their 2/4th campaign because everything happening will just be predictable and a waiting game of constant micromanaging. Without any exciting stuff happening after the year 2250/2300.\r\n\r\n83% of Stellaris owners never conquered another nations planet according to the steam achievements.\r\n94.1% of Stellaris owners never have finished and won a singleplayer campaign\r\n\r\nEven the starter edition is $50, now at an all time low because of the winter sales at $18. Yet for this price they only give you 2 DLC's (Utopia and Synthetic Dawn). 2 great expansions but still only a incredibly small addition to what this game has to offer at such a steep price.\r\n\r\nNot a singular new player stumbling upon Stellaris is willing to put down $150 for a bunch of DLC's, instead they'll buy the cheaper versions without any or very little DLC's. And be quickly disappointed (in most cases) as these versions only hold 5/100th of what the game has to offer. And if they do enjoy it, they'll have to spend a bunch of money on additional DLC's just to prolong their enjoyment of the game\r\n\r\nI really feel like this is a huge reason why most of the influx of new players during sales instantly vanishes the next month, and why the multiplayer scene is rotten and dying.", "timestamp_created": 1735252167, "timestamp_updated": 1735252530, "voted_up": false,

Set the THING in PANEL. And then you spend ten minutes clicking random things and doing yet more web searches until you find it. \r\n\r\nAnd yet you'll play it for tens of hours.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty meh. Without an historical setting to frame the game, the glaring artificiality of it is apparent and how it's really just a box full of game mechanics, without anything like a story to hold it together. Sure, sure, there's some oblique references to Stanislaw Lem here, but it's not like it's based on the works of Lem. It's a grab bag of tropes. The DLC are more tropes thrown together. If they're tropes you like, it's fun. But as more and more of them are available, it's a stone soup of a game.

The mechanics are pretty easy to get a hold on for a new player, I had no problem figuring out what everything did and the best way to do x to get y. The lore feels rewarding to try to find and there are so many little tidbits and story snacks to consume sometimes I forget that each galaxy is random.  Sometimes the game can get pretty slow, only to hit you with 55 notifications, six different attacking fleets, and a mid-game crisis. Things can get overwhelming sometimes, and in my opinion, that's when the game truly shines. Feeling like your empire is one starbase away from destruction, yet somehow keeping it together is an unmatched feeling that I just haven't gotten from other games until now.\nYou get to create your own empire (duh), but when you do there is a chance for that empire to show up as an NPC in one of your games which was SO COOL when I first saw it. It sounds lame, but trust me, it's a nice refresher to have a personalized and life- like empire instead of the boring regular ones. (don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the base ones, It's just less fun as they lack creativity compared to fighting the imperium of man for example). The play styles are amazing to try out, I personally love eradicating empires as life-hating communist robots from space Moscow. This game lets you take so many paths of action, I love it. It isn't unheard of, but it's another great boon.\nThe game isn't without its faults, the roll system is infuriating in the early game when you can't spare leaders for example, but they are minor and so few it makes the game feel polished to perfection, at least for me personally.
