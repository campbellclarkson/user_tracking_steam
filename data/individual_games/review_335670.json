mechanics affect the game. To be clear the game is not difficult, it's more of a annoying love-hate relationship that I can't recommend. \n\nSo first off to any one who is going to play anyways I have some suggestions to help you grasp things. \n1. After the first fight you might have the \"wary\" debuff. rest at the starting campfire they offer NO MATTER WHAT! Status buffs and debuffs are pretty massive in this game and with wary you lose 70% total defense period.\n2. after you've done the intro parts you might want to restart the game(no joke). You can save any items you want on the ground in the intro and come back for them after you get magical madoka'd by the truck. not really too important unless you want perfection like me\n\nok anyways now that y'all are ready to say hi to the wasteland let me explain where it gets easy and falls apart. About 10% through the game you gain the ability to turn bottles into op firebombs and a big meme in the community is \"just throw a firebomb at it\", but what this means is after you gain them enemies have to become glass canons to compensate. This doesn't make the game any harder really but what it does do is limit the effectiveness of doing anything other than steamrolling. \nTheres no middle ground between abusing the garbage combat mechanics and using self control against wiping everyone. and thats also a factor in why hard mode is so desperately thrust in your face in the beginning, but honestly it just sounds like more of a dumb chore I don't have time for.\n\nIn the end I just say throw the baby out with the bathwater. Theres nothing redeeming in the story even though I wanted an edgy game and overall its all just trash. throw it away. \n\nSpoilers from here on.\nOur mc is also irredeemable as the whole story only happens because of his selfishness. His friends said it best when they told him to give her to the rando army and in the end no one avoided anything. I do like his friends as characters though, They do a great job of providing in game motivation once you find out they're still alive helping her. I continue just to see sticky honestly and finally have a beer with him again.\n\nIn the end we're all pretty stupid for liking this game but I still enjoyed way too much of it and am still going. I can't recommend it but you can make your own choice.\n", "timestamp_created": 1736222591, "timestamp_updated": 1736223571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385949134826660156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184924236": {"recommendationid": "184924236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017941116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1079, "last_played": 1736023995}, "language": "english", "review": "For me it was pretty hard to grasp what LISA actually had to offer as a game. The pictures and vids were a bit cryptic to me, so I want to tell you about the mechanics first.\n\nLISA is a  2D side scrolling RPG with turn based battles. You will meet different \"heroes\" that you can recruit for your party, manage equipment and use items and abilities. Sounds pretty common, but thats not what defines LISA. What is it then?\n\nFor me its hard to describe in words. LISA is - different. Its unique. The way the story goes. The world, full of cruelty and strange mutants. The people you meet, how they are and what they do. And I want to give a special mention to the sound design, which is absolutely amazing and adds a lot to the atmosphere.\n\nI can only highly encourage everyone who is into experiencing something more uncommon and is fine with the mechanics to play this game.\n\nLISA is not without flaws. Sometimes its a bit hard to figure out where to go or what to do next. It's also very cryptic, especially considering the underlining world building. What is this world, who are these people, why do they do what they do. I found myself reading the wiki a lot, else I would have had issues understanding a lot of what was going on. If you want to go without the wiki, the DLC (\"The Joyful\") is doing a big part of clarifiying things, but sadly is way inferior to the \"main game\".", "timestamp_created": 1736166535, "timestamp_updated": 1736166535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184920881": {"recommendationid": "184920881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274189403", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 1319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 343, "playtime_at_review": 1319, "last_played": 1736385791}, "language": "english", "review": "its one thing to hear its like mother 3 and roll your eyes but to feel it carry that style of rpg and make it more serious and more intuitively raise that platforms complexity with its immersive decision making that matters with its emotional impact and simple but understandable consequences because the resources matter not just more buttons to hit or overly complicating stats and balance to be more engaging, after playing i watched a video showing what happens with each decision and how it affected me and it was really cool or even little personal stories like my russian roulette champion fardy who won me many mags with no save scum absolutely undefeated made everything feel more real\nits a simple tale too when it comes to its major plot points almost cliche movie like with this father fighting the world to save his daughter and by the end and what i didnt get in the beginning was the foolishness of brads fairytale fantasy in this very serious world it all really started to snap when the gang you fought with just come out with what should have been obvious from the start they all thought this was just their side of the gang trying to get some puss all the care i put in to save their lives the limbs i let brad lose\nabsolutely superb the only thing thing that took me out of it is things like buddy getting her face clawed up by some freak and is still like no get away from me im gonna go to the evil mask man like ???? \nlike i get shes not gonna instantly be like oh daddy save me but damn\nlevel pacing could have been better tho i liked all the levels alot but in a 2D space and having 5 different doors with massive biome changes and those to have a bunch of sercrets, jokes, loot and other stuff you dont want to miss like some cool optional enemy is as cool as it is overwhelming which is very \n9.5/10 really makes me want to see a mother 4 more now tho\n\nLISA THE JOYFUL: liked it alot tho it had its problems like it had a degree of lost charm and character interaction but retains the solid immersion and i loved the tight focused mechanical change and i didnt use joy so the challenge but i also feel art design and level structure has suffered but the story was good too\n8 i guess but thats just because it really could have had more to it ", "timestamp_created": 1736163190, "timestamp_updated": 1736386833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184909926": {"recommendationid": "184909926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207049647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1225, "last_played": 1736153473}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lisa es un juego con una historia postapocal\u00edptica dura y cruda, donde te obligan a tomar decisiones crueles y dif\u00edciles, en las que los objetos valen m\u00e1s que la vida de los personajes y en ocasiones tienes que elegir entre ellos o un personaje.
