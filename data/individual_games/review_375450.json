Ascension (this specific version of Sphere of Influence) captures the progression from mere Officer to Daimyo wonderfully. \n\nYou start small with your own little hamlet where you build a small insulated economy through a basic yet rewarding (spatial) puzzle mini game. Then you progress to be a player on the actual campaign map - perhaps you are given a castle to rule, or at least to administer. From there, you start to rule multiple castles and provinces, become the daimyo of your own clan. The final stage is then to have a clan so powerful that you have leaders that rule entire provinces for you, and execute military campaigns without your micromanagement, but merely following your high level orders.\n\nApart from this, the game of course features all the important characters from the sengoku jidai, and has a good amount of historical events. \n\nDefinitely recommended for anyone interested in this time period of Japanese history, and for any fan of (character-focused) strategy games!", "timestamp_created": 1737402381, "timestamp_updated": 1737402381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 716, "total_negative": 309, "total_reviews": 1025}, "cursors": {"AoJ4isXW4/8Cc77HrgM=": "Mon Jan 20 18:24:52 2025"}}
