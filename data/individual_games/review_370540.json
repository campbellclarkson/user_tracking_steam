Probably the most advanced strategy game ever. The attention to details is stunning. Every single vehicle and aircraft is modelled and rated including all division leaders and upwards.\r\n\r\nThe game is easy to play but hard to master. Supply is working properly, raillines are your main routes. Panzers are your friends on open grounds. The enemy A.I is excellent and very hard to lure.  The Air war is abstract and somewhat hard to understand. The manual are huge and almost on 300 pages. I have not read more than the tutorial and parts of the manual then I started playing for 200 hours and don\u00b4t see the need to go back because many rules are details that don\u00b4t affect the whole very much in either case.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended game. Most similar game would be the Decisive campaigns series. Both are excellent choices.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736286188, "timestamp_updated": 1736286188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 512, "total_negative": 55, "total_reviews": 567}, "cursors": {"AoJ43unT9vICcu2TkAI=": "Mon Jan 20 18:19:24 2025"}}
