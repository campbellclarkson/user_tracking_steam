I first tried the demo which seemed to work as expected. I then purchased the full copy and was not able to get past the launcher force closing. My only tinker steps to alleviate was to try a hex editor trick in which I could not find the indicated byte in the guide. I immediately returned. I have played Rising on Xbox for your info, and it was good. \n\nSo onto Fusion. I had a minor hiccup in the first launch. It asked for a CD key and such. I believe there was a login request as well. I unfortunately dont remember specifics, but the problem I ran into on first launch seemed to clear up after retrying a second time. The game itself runs great on deck with default video settings, no tweaks made. As for the gameplay I do seem to prefer it over when I played rising on Xbox series X. I understand why risings UI is criticized after playing Fusion. I have no experience with evo. I recommend this version for deck owners. Also I want to add that I hate these required launchers other than steam as well. I do try to avoid supporting AAA companies, but a great game is a great game that unfortunately the publisher taints the developers.", "timestamp_created": 1737149788, "timestamp_updated": 1737149788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546436309814453125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "185134381": {"recommendationid": "185134381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209426225", "num_games_owned": 574, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 430, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1736730926}, "language": "english", "review": "imagine getting handed down an xbox one, and the first time you open it, you scroll through the list of games, and see TRIALS FUSION.\r\n\r\ni originally played this way back when it was closer to new, and i loved it. i never got incredibly far, really. but i had a great time laughing at the ragdoll physics.\r\n\r\nnow, as an adult. i played through all but 1-2 of the basegame tracks that were a little too hard for me. and man. it's fun. trials is fun. it's a very vibes-driven type game for me, i like the backgrounds and environments a lot, and them breaking down basically as soon as you open your replay and enable the freecam is part of the appeal.\r\n\r\nthis might be peak trials, honestly. the fmx system is a biiit weird and jank but it is also relying on ragdoll physics and weird stick inputs so it's kinda also funny and interesting to me.", "timestamp_created": 1736367442, "timestamp_updated": 1736367442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546497941017150879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184765295": {"recommendationid": "184765295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081434885", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 577, "last_played": 1736017134}, "language": "english", "review": "Ubisoft platform is buggy and slow.
