Unfortunately, I cannot recommend that you currently (January 2025) purchase the game on Steam, because of some kind of error going on preventing many people, including myself, from launching and playing the game. You can check the Steam forums and other places on the internet - when you launch the game, Steam will say \"Updating Executable\" but the executable never updates and the game never launches.\n\nI've tried every solution people have suggested and none of them worked for me. There's many people who say the solutions don't work for them either. Some people suggest that you have to wait a while; I've waited a few days and still not succeeded. I'll happily change my review to positive if the issue ever gets fixed - apparently 2K said they fixed the issue last month yet many people (again, myself included) are still having the problem. Some users suggest it has to do with Steam's old DRM that is out of date called CEG (Custom Executable Generation) but I'm no expert in any of that. Many users report the GOG version of XCOM EU/EW works just fine.\n\nSo, buyer of the Steam version beware!\n\n::EDIT:: So, after I posted this review, the game started working again. Coincidentally, someone else on the forums had the same experience. I'm still tentatively going to keep this negative because so many people are still having problems.

None of the fixes worked for me, I just made my complaint and tried loading the next day. I am still having some issues with saves in which the turn never ends, essentially forcing me to quit, but this time I haven't bothered verifying the integrity of game files through steam.\n\nI'm going to leave the review negative (at least for now) but I'd like to stress that my issue isn't with the game itself. This is a fine turn-based tactical strategy game. It's not too complex but has enough depth and progression that the gameplay doesn't become stale. My issue is with the situation itself, with Valve and with the publishers. The game works on the DRM free GOG so it appears this bug is a Steam DRM issue, and one that when looking at the discussion forum, neither Valve nor 2K are willing to take responsibility for. Civ V (from the same devs/pub) is apparently in a similar, broken state.\n\nThis isn't the first 'old' game I've had issues with on Steam either. I recently played Saints Row 3 and was experiencing stuttering every minute or so. It turned out it was trying to connect to none existent servers and that was causing the freezing. Luckily PCgamingwiki had a fix that worked but the fact that these problems arise shouldn't be acceptable, even on older games.\n\nDigital distribution has long been the norm for PC gaming and for better or worse, Valve (and Steam) are synonymous with the pastime. Many of us have hundreds of games and more importantly, hundreds or thousands of pounds invested in this software. They basically have a monopoly and have gotten lazy with it. It isn't right that single player games we've bought can just stop working on a whim, even ones released over 10 years ago. Valve's own recent survey showed a significant portion of its users are still playing older games, so lack of interest is no excuse. \n\nIn an ideal world the companies that own and make money from these games, would ensure they worked. Indefinitely. Or we'd all have switched to services like GOG, but the features and convenience of Steam have kept it as the dominant service.

Super baffling how a game is still allowed on Steam that doesn't work. I was super excited to start my X-COM play-through just to be met with \"Updating executable\" for it to end up not launching at all. \n\nNo word from 2K nor Steam. [b]Would not recommend purchasing any 2K titles on any platform[/b] as this isn't just a singular issue with X-COM but also including Civ 5 which also doesn't want to launch. This all occurred after I noticed there was an update released for the games...\n\nOnce they removed the 2K Launcher from their games, even on their FAQ it was listed:\n\"Q: Will I lose access to any of my games?\n\nA: No, so long as you purchased the game on Steam or Epic, you\u2019ll continue to have access to it on that platform.\"\n\nThat was clearly a lie, even after having uninstalled the game, reinstalled a bunch of times, do a clean wipe of all folders relating to X-COM and running multiple verify integrity checks for the game to still not working is laughable. \n\nWhat a great start to a new year by sending out a patch that bricks the games that you paid for. Tremendous job...\n\n[b]Update Edit:[/b]\n[b]It's in the middle of the night, at 12:55 AM on Wednesday of January 8th, 2025[/b]. I decided to give this game one more shot in terms of it launching, low and behold it magically starts up again. I have no clue why or what caused my game to finally start back up again. Nothing new was added, the game wasn't added to any of my game update logs either...\n\nI managed to start the tutorial and am able to play X-COM again. Hopefully this bug doesn't occur again, but I will leave my review as negative as many others are unfortunately also still experiencing this bug. With no real explanation as to why the game started up again, I am still super cautious on this bug reoccurring again with the \"Updating executable\". \n\nI will re-update my review to [b]POSITIVE[/b] once I have [b]fully finished[/b] my X-COM play-through [b]AND[/b] 2K or Steam [b]provides an explanation[/b] as to why the game took such a long time to be fixed or what even caused this in the first place. Before that, my review will stay [b]NEGATIVE[/b].\n\nI hope everyone enjoys their New Years and Holidays!

Balancing your squad\u2019s combat readiness with the demands of managing resources, building facilities, and researching alien tech creates a constant sense of urgency. Every decision feels meaningful, and every mistake feels like your own \u2013 which makes your eventual victories all the sweeter.\r\n\r\nThe tactical combat is simply chef\u2019s kiss. Each mission is like a chess game where one wrong move can cost you a soldier you\u2019ve grown attached to. The turn-based gameplay is brutally fair, rewarding strategic thinking while punishing recklessness. The thrill of landing a last-ditch critical shot or executing the perfect flanking maneuver never gets old, even a decade later.\r\n\r\nWhat truly makes Enemy Unknown shine is its emotional core. Watching your soldiers grow from inexperienced rookies into battle-hardened veterans creates a strong bond with your squad. The permadeath mechanic only heightens the stakes \u2013 losing a soldier isn\u2019t just a gameplay setback; it\u2019s a gut punch. Every loss is personal, and every success feels like a triumph against impossible odds.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s visual style is clean and functional, with just the right amount of flair to bring the alien threats and your soldiers to life. The soundtrack, composed by Michael McCann, is haunting and atmospheric, perfectly setting the mood for humanity\u2019s desperate struggle.\r\n\r\nSure, there are a few nitpicks, like the occasional frustration of missing a 95% shot (we\u2019ve all been there) or the relatively simple base-building compared to its classic predecessor. But those are minor blemishes on an otherwise stellar game.\r\n\r\nIn 2025, XCOM: Enemy Unknown remains a must-play for anyone who loves strategy, sci-fi, or just a great story of underdogs fighting back against overwhelming odds. It\u2019s a modern classic that set a gold standard for the genre and still has the power to grip players today.", "timestamp_created": 1736152872, "timestamp_updated": 1736152872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184906746": {"recommendationid": "184906746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338344877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 257, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1736241433}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game but pls fix bug \"updating executable\"", "timestamp_created": 1736149554, "timestamp_updated": 1736149554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184894166": {"recommendationid": "184894166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093865395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6671, "last_played": 1672639472}, "language": "english", "review": "Windows 11 not working; broken again by 2K (with no help from Valve), same as in Civ 5.\n\nDON'T BUY FROM STEAM, DON'T BUY FROM 2K", "timestamp_created": 1736132470, "timestamp_updated": 1736132470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512278318405151367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184888117": {"recommendationid": "184888117", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970892857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5059, "last_played": 1734307653}, "language": "english", "review": "Does not run anymore. 2k Support basically says: \"We know.

Dieses Spiel stellt deine strategischen F\u00e4higkeiten auf die ultimative Probe und h\u00e4lt dich von der ersten bis zur letzten Minute in Atem.\n\nZugeben, was Remakes und Neuauflagen angeht, bin ich grunds\u00e4tzlich erst einmal skeptisch, manchmal vielleicht sogar voreingenommen. Sodass diese es manchmal besonders schwer haben, mich zu \u00fcberzeugen. Aber schlie\u00dflich m\u00fcssen sie ja auch in \u201egewisse Fu\u00dfstapfen\u201c treten oder noch besser: Die Fu\u00dfstapfen \u201e\u00fcbertreten\u201c. \ud83d\ude09 Und gerade im Fall von XCOM. Das erste und originale Spiel von 1994, [b]X-COM: Ufo Defense[/b] \u2013 auch unter dem Titel [b]UFO: Enemy Unkown[/b] bekannt \u2013 habe ich geliebt und lange N\u00e4chte damit verbracht. Und obwohl es ein Single-Player ist, so haben wir uns sogar zu zweit oder dritt vor dem R\u00f6hrenmonitor versammelt, um zusammen die Spannung zu genie\u00dfen.\n\nAber was [b]XCOM[/b] von 2012 wirklich auszeichnet, ist seine unglaubliche Tiefe. Jede Mission f\u00fchlt sich an wie ein spannendes Schachspiel, bei dem jeder Zug entscheidend ist. Du musst deine Soldaten mit Bedacht platzieren, die Umgebung ausnutzen und jeden Zug genau planen, um die feindlichen Alien-Kr\u00e4fte zu besiegen. Dabei sorgen die zuf\u00e4llig generierten Missionen und Karten f\u00fcr endlose Wiederspielbarkeit und eine unvorhersehbare Herausforderung bei jedem Durchlauf.\n\nDie Spannung wird durch die beeindruckende Grafik (f\u00fcr 2012) und den atmosph\u00e4rischen Soundtrack weiter verst\u00e4rkt. Die detaillierte Darstellung der au\u00dferirdischen Bedrohung und die intensiven Gefechte lassen dich tief in die Welt von [b]XCOM[/b] eintauchen. Das Gef\u00fchl, wenn du eine schier unl\u00f6sbare Situation meisterst und deine Soldaten lebendig nach Hause bringst, ist absolut unvergleichlich.\n\nWas [b]XCOM: Enemy Unknown[/b] ebenfalls besonders macht, ist die emotionale Bindung zu deinen Soldaten. Jeder Soldat hat eine eigene Geschichte, und es ist herzzerrei\u00dfend, wenn einer von ihnen im Kampf f\u00e4llt. Diese emotionale Tiefe und das strategische Gameplay machen das Spiel zu einem wahren Meisterwerk.\n\nKurz gesagt: [b]XCOM: Enemy Unknown[/b] ist ein Muss f\u00fcr jeden, der taktische Spiele liebt und sich einer packenden Herausforderung stellen m\u00f6chte. Ein zeitloses Spiel, das auch nach vielen Jahren nichts von seinem Reiz verloren hat.\n\nDie Entwickler kommen wohl nicht oft raus?!\n", "timestamp_created": 1735926926, "timestamp_updated": 1735926926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184660022": {"recommendationid": "184660022", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974225150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1735924604}, "language": "english", "review": "doesn't work anymore", "timestamp_created": 1735924619, "timestamp_updated": 1735924619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184648819": {"recommendationid": "184648819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045025235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 888, "last_played": 1613204639}, "language": "english", "review": "games broke", "timestamp_created": 1735917752, "timestamp_updated": 1735917752, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184647132": {"recommendationid": "184647132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012292634", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1147, "last_played": 1735643732}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly the game is unplayable.

You get two moves if you don't shoot on your first move. No more managing multiple bases with sat coverage performing the tasks. Of course the original game was programmed to attack your bases if you got too far ahead so that's missing here but having to go into a downed terror ship provides a much bigger challenge,  Cut scenes provide a much greater narative and you really feel like your the commander.\n Although this is older than XCOM2 I think this game is superior to it in many ways. XCOM2 added a lot of soldier customization and squad management but sadly that's about it. You don't go in to downed ships. In fact mission types are pretty limited. The 'alien Boss's are more gimmick than challenging' The chosen just have lots of hitpoints and gimmick abilities. Because the A.I. is also weak it's not hard to lure any alien, even the chosen, into an easy turkey shoot.\n  The A.I. here is much better. the boss's here are far more dangerous and the narrative focus is far better. Add in the long War Mod and it just doesn't get any better. Of all the xcom games this one stands above all the rest.\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1735694201, "timestamp_updated": 1735694201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455465823411941528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184377493": {"recommendationid": "184377493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004118746", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 374, "playtime_at_review": 9103, "last_played": 1736389986}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately, after contacting 2K games and asking about the issue, it seems the updating executable doesnt have a solid fix that 2K can advise on, as such I am leaving a negative review as the game is literally unlaunchable right now on steam.
