The world is bizarre yet wonderfully unique, and the memorable characters make the experience even better. The game feels like a more cracked version of something like Fallout: New Vegas with more western spaghetti elements thrown in it. The focus mostly on side quests and choices that genuinely impact the outcome on your adventures.\n\nThe humor is the heart and soul of this game, it's pretty special. While the main campaign isn\u2019t particularly long, the content packed into the game is more than satisfying. It\u2019s also not grind-heavy (unless you want it to be) and the combat, while simple, gets the job done. In fact, many situations can be resolved without resorting to fighting, which adds a refreshing layer of choice to the gameplay.\n\nThe only negative i can think of is that there are some quests or puzzle that's not really explained well on what to do that if you're struggling, there's no shame in looking up a guide for it, one of the big side quest of the game of the game requires an object that you find from a random encounter. \n\nif you're looking for a game to have a good laugh and engage in the weird worldbuilding, I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1735827403, "timestamp_updated": 1735827403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "184509835": {"recommendationid": "184509835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958340917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 313, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1737080875}, "language": "english", "review": "great game true its just stick figures but the story and rpg style is fantastic i cant stop playing this game i love it i recommend it if you aing got much to do and want a fun/quick game to play", "timestamp_created": 1735804139, "timestamp_updated": 1735804139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184494350": {"recommendationid": "184494350", "author": {"steamid": "76561199695664714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1832, "last_played": 1735788958}, "language": "english", "review": "funny to cast beans at dead dudes  10/10", "timestamp_created": 1735788609, "timestamp_updated": 1735788609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184472848": {"recommendationid": "184472848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000461284", "num_games_owned": 1822, "num_reviews": 261, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 718, "last_played": 1735767220}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, I am not going to sugar coat anything here. \n\nThe good part is the jokes, exploration and the combat is alright.\n\nThe bad part is random encounters while exploring and vague quest reminder from your partner.\n\nThese random encounters 50% of the time will be real bs, when I was playing for first 30 minutes I somehow encountered a cow that had 84 hp while I am dealing at maximum 7 damage. Considering that much hp has only when enemy has high stats meaning the enemy can two shot the player. Of course there is ability to surrender to the enemy and that sounds fine except it will still count as losing. In this game it is not possible to die, instead of dying player is transported back to his/her room and new day starts. Sounds pretty normal right? Not really because if you had used some buffs that last for day it all will be consumed. One time I surrendered to an enemy and I could continue journey and rest of times it was loss, i don't get it.\n\nAlso, player has no idea what kind of damage will deal these random encounters, is it going to be melee, ranged, poison, fire, spooky or lightning? The bad part about elemental damage is that you only get resistances in mid game while you can encounter snakes that deal fire damage before getting to mid game.\n\nThis game does not have quest log per say, instead you must interact with your chosen partner and ask about main quest or side quest, but unfortunately your partner most of the time will give vague description what you must do and it gets confusing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1735770172, "timestamp_updated": 1735770172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55381399393081665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184407089": {"recommendationid": "184407089", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031495643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1736311814}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed the mechanics, as well as the funny story and worldbuilding.", "timestamp_created": 1735718192, "timestamp_updated": 1735718192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184399752": {"recommendationid": "184399752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116283418", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 898, "last_played": 1735710259}, "language": "english", "review": "divertidissimo. cheio de conteudo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 um RPG muito profundo, mas tem muita coisa pra fazer, muito segredo pra achar. ele \u00e9 facil at\u00e9 (principalmente stackando comida e pegando 180 de moxie, tudo morre em 1 hit), mas os playstyles s\u00e3o at\u00e9 bem variados. o humor \u00e9 otimo, simples e engra\u00e7ado, e combina muito com o jogo. no geral, vale muito o pre\u00e7o (ainda mais considerando que a DLC \u00e9 baratinha, e muito muito boa), da pra passar umas 20h jogando f\u00e1cil, deve ser papo de 30-40 pro platina", "timestamp_created": 1735710437, "timestamp_updated": 1735710437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469168901443481445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184393619": {"recommendationid": "184393619", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974134465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1735703998}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.
