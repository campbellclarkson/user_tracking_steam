similar to Smash Bros, it certainly don't feel like a smash clone.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the pixel art animations and how technical they can be. They really help you understand the core gamplay of a platform fighting game by letting you understanding timing of frames. Also the tutorials, albeit difficult, are a great way to help you understand both the general mechanics of the game and the in-depth moveset of every character.\r\n\r\nThat's right, because the selling point of this game resides in the diversity of how each character feels. Everyone of them feels unique thanks to a wide range of different moves. I really like the fact that this game brings IDEAS to the genre. There's the tanky character which can recover itself by creating pillars underneath itself, the flanky one that can hang up at distance to an enemy it has previously marked etc.\r\n\r\nAlso I wanna point out that there's a pletora of game modes that really help the game feel complete, at the same level of the leading figure of the genre.\r\n\r\nOverall I think this is a really well crafted fighting game and the developers' passion is visible, if you're interested to the genre you should definitely try it.

Characters are good, the story mode is ok, maps are decent, and DLC content is fine. But this game wouldn't be where it currently is without its workshop support, this, has truly brought the best out of this above average game.\n\nImagine Ronald McDonald fighting Mario in Xen. No? Well, you're lucky, this game can do exactly that and more. There are endless possibilities and ways you can mix-match characters and stages to make a fight unique and outstanding.\n\nI don't have enough words for this game, just, play it, download whatever you like and give it a go. You'll have fun.\n\nQuick Score: 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1736195913, "timestamp_updated": 1736195913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

If you want to play a game similar to Smash Bros that still feels unique and that you can play with your friends without needing to either be in person together or pay for a subscription, this is for you. The vast modding scene for this game also helps it feel fresh and fun at all times. It's not the hardest thing in the world to set up a simple character mod so long as you can understand some basic code and do some pixel art animations. But even when you're not playing with mods enabled the different characters play really differently from each other but still feel like they all work together.
