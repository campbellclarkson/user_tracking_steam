In Headspace, if you need a certain body to solve a puzzle, head out and find that body to bring back to the puzzle room.\r\n\r\nI had a great time playing this game.

While it has been a while since playing this game, I'm really impressed how they handled areas like the world and its bizarre/dark humour and especially the combat.\r\n\r\nThere's always a surprise and charm to be had in this game and I do insanely recall an amazing part of the game where you come out feeling like a total BOSS by the end of it (no spoilers, heh). \r\n\r\nAlong with the phenomenal soundtrack that blends the future sci-fi and the retro feel of the bit of the 1960's vibe in there, there is so much that this game does to bring in the best possible experience for a gamer.\r\n\r\nI also might suggest something like this to someone who is a Star Trek fan. I'm not even a Star Trek fan and I feel this fits that original Star Trek series so dastardly well. Double Fine really provided a unique vision and a one-of-a-kind experience here.
