the right thing commander. Just... do the right thing.\u201d[/i]\n~Director Boyle[/h1]\n\nAt the end of 2000s, [b]EA[/b] destroyed pretty much everything there was about [b]Command & Conquer[/b]. It was almost like they were on a mission or something. They've shut down [b]Westwood[/b], they've canceled their [b]Tiberian Twilight[/b] (AKA [b]C&C3: Incursion[/b], a direct sequel to [b]Tiberian Sun[/b]) and even after the franchise was given to other people under their wing, they didn't stop. Sure, what [b]Mark Skaggs[/b] and his team did in [b]C&C Generals[/b] was anything [i]but[/i] [b]C&C[/b] we all used to know, but it was still a solid project. Yet [b]EA[/b] scrapped the sequel, turned it into an f2p game and then, after literally everybody hated the idea, canceled the whole thing for good. End of the story. Which left [b]EA[/b] in a very [b]Finding Nemo[/b] situation. Remember that \u201cNow what?\u201d scene? Well, that's pretty much what happened to [b]EA[/b]. They've wasted quite a lot of money, yet they ended up with nothing. Original makers were no more, the old series was dead and the \u201creboot\u201d canceled. It was time for them to stop for a moment and actually think 'bout what to do next. Guess what? They actually did that for a change. [i]Think.[/i]\n\nWhile [b]Generals[/b] game was praised by many for its gameplay, many others refused to accept it for being too different from the original series [i]and[/i] not following the original story / canon. Decision #1: a new game in the series is going to go back to the roots. In other words, [b]EA[/b] was about to revive [b]Westwood[/b]'s [b]C&C3[/b]. [b]Westwood[/b] already had lots of plans for their sequel, like that alien race called [b]Scrin[/b] (we've already seen their ships in the [b]TS[/b] and the [b]Renegade[/b]) so naturally, we've got that. Still, just pretending that [b]Generals[/b] never happened would have feel like going back to the stone age. Therefore, decision #2: a new game, while going old school, will keep lots of the elements from [b]Generals[/b].\n\nThere was a problem, though. [b]Westwood[/b]'s [b]C&C3[/b] was supposed to be the end of the road. Remember how [b]Tiberium[/b] was slowly taking over the planet in the [b]TS[/b]? The [b]Incursion[/b] was supposed to be the end of that story, [i]but[/i] [b]W3D[/b] engine (renamed to [b]SAGE[/b] by [b]EA[/b] after they were done with [b]Westwood[/b]) didn't support the [b]Tiberium[/b] growth. Decision #3: to keep as many people who worked with games on [b]SAGE[/b] before ([b]Generals[/b], [b]Battle for Middle Earth[/b]). They'll figure something out. Don't let them do their way with the cutscenes, though. Nobody liked what they did with those and pretty much every review went hard on [b]Generals[/b] for that. So, decision #4: let's make some old-school cutscenes, but make them expensive like never before to avoid cheesiness. Finally. Multiplayer. Nobody liked [b]Westwood Online[/b] service. Everybody loved [b]GameSpy[/b] in [b]Generals[/b]. Decision #5: to make multiplayer based on [b]GameSpy[/b] service and push into that territory as hard as possible. That's it. That was the idea. And after that? After that it was all up to [b]EA Los Angeles[/b] (former LA division of [b]DreamWorks Interactive[/b]), which finally became somewhat stable after all the acquisition chaos. Well. Ladies, gentlemen, everybody else, please welcome, [b]Tiberium Wars[/b].\n\nThe first thing I've noticed back in the days was how similar it was to [b]Incursion[/b]. Not content-wise (I'll return to that later), but visually. Not like we had lots of pictures from [b]Westwood[/b]'s canceled game, but still, judging by what we did have, [b]TW[/b] was exactly that. It looked like what old-school fans waited for the whole time, the original concepts were still recognizable, etc. It felt good. Really good. Sure, lots of the original ideas were scrapped (originally, [b]Westwood[/b] planned four playable factions \u2013 [b]GDI[/b], [b]Nod[/b], [b]CABAL[/b] and [b]Scrin[/b], while [b]Tiberium Wars[/b]  only has two \u2013 good ol' [b]GDI[/b] and [b]Nod[/b] with tiny four missions long bonus campaign for [b]Scrin[/b], which you unlock by beating both others), but still, it was [i]way[/i] better than nothing.\n\nAnd you know what? Seeing the old gameplay to return felt good too. Not because it was [i]old[/i], obviously, everything needs to evolve, but because it felt... [b]C&C[/b]. If you know what I mean. [b]Generals[/b]? If something, it felt more like something from [b]BLIZZARD[/b]. No [b]Dune[/b]-like harvesters, builder units that can build anywhere on the map... [b]Tiberium Wars[/b]? It brought all the familiar stuff back. We're building with our yards again, we can't build too far away from our buildings, harvesters are back... In other words, it [i]is[/i] [b]C&C[/b]. Which, again, doesn't mean it forgot about [b]Generals[/b]. There'll be those points we'll be able to capture for bonus income, the abilities, while not revolving around experience anymore, are still kinda presented in a way (they've kinda combined those with those powerful attacks from the original [b]C&C[/b]), etc. Also, they didn't forget about [b]Red Alert 2[/b]. Not only infantry will be able to occupy the civilian buildings, we'll also get real places like the [b]White House[/b] and the [b]Buckingham Palace[/b]. Lots of bonus objectives were added too, which adds to replayability.\n\nUnfortunately, the new guys? They didn't really figure anything out about the [b]Tiberium[/b]. And as the result? The whole idea got scrapped. Which was a [i]huge[/i] mistake. Why? Well, because it makes things... weird. Instead of a sequel, [b]C&C3[/b] feels more like a remake of the [b]Tiberian Sun[/b]. Something that takes place in the alternative universe, in which nothing from it happened. And you know what? The story only makes things worse. Remember [b]Kane[/b] having an injured face after his temple was destroyed at the end of the very first game? Well, he's all healthy now. Why? I dunno. Technically, there was a strong hint at the end of [b]TS[/b]' expansion to suggest he's a clone now, but nothing like that is told officially here. Instead, we've got a bunch of boring talks and copy/pasted stuff from previous games. Blah-blah-blah [b]GDI[/b] needs to protect the planet, blah-blah-blah [b]Kane[/b] shoots traitors (remember [b]Seth[/b]? There's a female version of him now)... Boring. [b]Hollywood[/b] cast helps, though. There's [b]Billy Dee Williams[/b] from [b]Star Wars[/b] and [b]Batman[/b], there's [b]Michael Ironside[/b] from [b]Top Gun[/b], there's [b]Jennifer Morrison[/b] from [b]House[/b]... Heck, [b]GDI[/b] campaign even has two different endings! Still, boring story is boring. And the fact that it ends with the cliffhanger only makes things worse.\n\nThey did try with the multiplayer, though. They really did. Heck, they tried to turn [b]C&C3[/b] into sport by introducing us to so-called [b]BattleCast[/b]. A service that used to let us schedule games and watch them like our usual sport broadcasts. Note the \u201cused to\u201d part, though, because obviously, multiplayer here is long gone too. That's just what [b]EA[/b] does. They make online-oriented games and then quickly shut the services down. Just because.\n\nStill, [b]C&C3[/b] was a thing. Was it perfect? No. Aside from boring story, I could mention things like speed settings being gone for good (which was one of my biggest complaints about [b]Generals[/b], I just can't enjoy RTS games when they're too slow, and [b]C&C3[/b] sure is too) and some campaign missions that didn't give us enough freedom and as the result felt more like a puzzle with only one correct solution. But it was a thing. Finally, after taking over, [b]EA[/b] established a solid new place for the series. They did something right for a change. [b]C&C3[/b] was like a new start. A thing to make us believe that future was bright. Was it, though?

Though there are some issues with this campaign. That being the balancing for the units changed since the launch of the game and the campaign was negatively effected from this, the main issues are that rocket squads were tuned to be stronger causing them to out range your defence building, this is bad because some missions are no-build and your defences get wrecked far harder than expected. On the GDI campaign you will feel this the most while the Nod campaign is playable start to finish. I'd recommend a mod or to patch to a previous version to experience the campaign how it was meant to be. \nThe units are a very good point to the game as well and are some of my favorite in any rts period. They are all different from one another with the progression from one tier of tech to the next being very rewarding with the units looking and feeling more powerful than the previous tier. If you finish the campaign I'd recommend you to try out the skirmish as the factions are really fun to mess around with against the ai, especially in a ffa 8 player match or a team fight. If you want to try out multiplayer there is a launcher and a community outside of steam as EA is no longer supporting it but there are enough players that you should be able to get a game any time in the day.\n\nGreat game and personally my favorite in the Command & Conquer series alongside its expansion Kane's Wrath, 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1736299984, "timestamp_updated": 1736299984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184978364": {"recommendationid": "184978364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048426414", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 224, "playtime_at_review": 821, "last_played": 1737153621}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u0431\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439.", "timestamp_created": 1736210406, "timestamp_updated": 1736210406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184969476": {"recommendationid": "184969476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142254666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 388, "playtime_at_review": 9102, "last_played": 1736558990}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente jogo, muita divers\u00e3o em fam\u00edlia jogando no modo multijogador!", "timestamp_created": 1736201826, "timestamp_updated": 1736201826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184965140": {"recommendationid": "184965140", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080919275", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "playtime_at_review": 4912, "last_played": 1736204150}, "language": "english", "review": "C&C Tiberium Wars is simply the best RTS ever created.", "timestamp_created": 1736198178, "timestamp_updated": 1736198178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184964358": {"recommendationid": "184964358", "author": {"steamid": "76561199157316478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1623, "playtime_at_review": 2343, "last_played": 1737139460}, "language": "german", "review": "Cooles Strategie Spiel\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736197549, "timestamp_updated": 1736197549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184930569": {"recommendationid": "184930569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020313737", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1441, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1736527256}, "language": "english", "review": "I Have Been Playing Command & Conquer Games Since the Launch of the First Command and Conquer Back in 1995 it Cost a Mere R85.00 Those day's and They Made History Being That They Addressed You Personally as Commander in the In Game Video's ...

There was once a revolutionary series of RTS games that helped define the genre, but alas they were owned by a doomed development studio. The were then adopted by a great evil. An EAvil if you will. Thee company slapped the series logo on thier new RTS that while not terrible, lacked the soul of its ancestors. But one day somthing happened to the EAvil. Like the Grinch they had a moment of revelation and began the great work of reviving the long lost game series. And thus C&C Tiberium Wars was born. it was not perfect, but if you squinted at a picture of it you could see the resembalance to its great grandfathers. Then by some miracle a second twin emerged from the EAvil's dark womb. They named it Kanes Revenge, and for a time all was good in the world. The EAvil soon returned to its wicked ways and went on to birth an abomination that ravenously consumed the series...But that is a story for another time. For here before you lay the golden child of the lost tribe of Westwood. Treat her well and introduce her to some Mod friends that she might thrive under your care.

It's likely just reviews from gamers that want epic cutscenes instead of learning/playing games themselves. Every mission is reasonable & has a puzzle for you to figure out, often times with most of the pieces already in place.\n\nThe game requires a focus on more than just tank spam to win on hard difficulty. It isn't quite Starcraft 2 level complicated, but a well balanced army will always beat spamming just 1 unit.
