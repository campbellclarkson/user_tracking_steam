Developed by FromSoftware, this spiritual successor to Demon\u2019s Souls introduced the world to the dark, brutal, and intricately designed kingdom of Lordran, captivating players with its unforgiving difficulty and deeply rewarding gameplay.\n\nAt its core, Dark Souls is about learning, growth, and perseverance. Every enemy, every boss, every inch of Lordran is a test of your skill, patience, and determination. Death isn\u2019t a punishment but a lesson, urging you to adapt, strategize, and try again. The combat system, characterized by its weighty, deliberate feel, demands precision and mastery. Each swing, roll, and parry carries consequences, turning even minor skirmishes into thrilling encounters.\n\nThe world of Lordran is a masterpiece of interconnected design. From the moment you set foot in Firelink Shrine, the game encourages exploration, rewarding curiosity with shortcuts, hidden paths, and treasures. The seamless way areas like the Undead Burg, Blighttown, and Anor Londo connect creates a sense of place and discovery that few games can match. The atmosphere is oppressive yet mesmerizing, with crumbling ruins, foreboding forests, and majestic yet decayed architecture painting a picture of a world on the brink of collapse.\n\nThe storytelling is subtle and enigmatic, unfolding through cryptic dialogue, item descriptions, and environmental clues. Instead of spoon-feeding a narrative, Dark Souls invites players to piece together its lore and themes. It\u2019s a story of cycles, despair, and fleeting hope, where the fates of gods and mortals intertwine in tragic ways. The ambiguity gives the world an air of mystery, making every revelation feel earned and impactful.\n\nBoss battles are the game\u2019s defining moments, each presenting unique challenges that test your reflexes, strategy, and resilience. Whether it\u2019s the iconic encounter with the towering Iron Golem, the haunting beauty of the Abyssal Artorias, or the relentless aggression of Ornstein and Smough, these fights are unforgettable, blending spectacle with substance.\n\nThe game\u2019s mechanics emphasize personal growth. The bonfire system serves as both a sanctuary and a risk-reward mechanic, while the leveling system allows you to tailor your character to your preferred playstyle. Whether you wield a hulking greatsword, delicate sorceries, or a trusty shield and spear, Dark Souls offers a wealth of options for creative builds.\n\nThe haunting score by Motoi Sakuraba underscores the emotional weight of the game, with somber melodies accompanying moments of quiet reflection and thunderous orchestration heightening the intensity of boss encounters.\n\nDark Souls is not a game that holds your hand, and its difficulty can be intimidating for newcomers. Yet, for those willing to embrace its challenges, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and mastery that few others can match. It\u2019s not just about beating the game, it\u2019s about conquering yourself, pushing through frustration, and emerging stronger on the other side.\n\nFor its groundbreaking design, unforgettable world, and deep, meaningful gameplay, Dark Souls remains a titan in the gaming world. Whether you\u2019re a first-timer or a returning champion, venturing into Lordran is an experience that will leave an indelible mark on your gaming journey.

It was a unique experience with some pretty good boss battles, and some good locations to explore, however I do feel like this game gets a little bit too much praise, even for it's time. This game came out in 2011, Borderlands 2 came out in 2012....\n\n             I 100%ed the achievements on steam on NG +4, and Guess what? This has to be one of the most over hyped games of all time, with the most die hard edge lords defending it known to mankind; it's kinda cringe. I remember seeing everyone praise this game when it came out, back in 2011, for being hard and captivating. I don't see many talking about the downsides of this game, and its short comings. I found myself online a lot of time,  reading up on forms about players going through similar issues that I was having with the game. \n\n               After playing the game and actually breaking down the game elements, I just felt a huge disconnect. Putting in another ~20hrs into gameplay after beating the game has made me see even more flaws in development choices with enchanted weapons, boss enchantment weapons, hidden buffs/debuffs on equipment, spells, ect. This game does a poor job on informing its players(in-game) and its a big f*** you by the Devs, and it does it on a really shit engine with a terrible character control model, and with dog shyt hitbox's and collision boxes. I'm all for shitting engines and graphics when the control models are tuned in,  but this game just has a lot of dog shyt moments.  \n\n              I like the game's aura and esthetics, and I believe it's the main reason why it popped off back in 2011. However for me this is mediocre game, with alright moments and stagnant lows. The hyped killed it for me, I tried to go into this game blind to get an authentic experience and was left disappointed. I beat this game in 1 week with the DLC and the hardest boss was Manus on NG+,  if it wasn't for the Devs sh!ty game philosophy I would have smoked his ass on the Default playthrough.  \n\n           To conclude this rant, the lows of this game sit at 4/10 and the highs sit at 7/10, this game hovers around a 5/10 or a 6/10 for me.....

I also have no desire to spend the amount of time and dedication to a game that punishes you for being a casual player. I won't be getting any of the subsequent games.\n\nUpdate: I wanted to give the game more of a chance. Turns out, on the 2nd level, there are 3 directions you can go. 2 of them lead to impossible death, while 1 is the way you're supposed to go. The problem is, the route you're supposed to go is much hard to find than the other 2 routes, which are plain as day. I ended up having to start over because I used up all of my items, humanity, and souls trying to go the 2 impossible routes. Now that I know which way to go, the game isn't quite as punishing. I'm still not thrilled about the lack of explanation as to how things work since wasting items on experimentation is not something you can afford to do in this game. I find myself often looking up information in guides, which to me should be a last resort. That tells me this game wasn't made well.
