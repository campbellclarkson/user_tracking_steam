The game starts off quite slow, but the story gets really good around  the 15 hour mark and kept me hooked until the end. I also loved the intricate puzzle design that keeps building on every unique ability that you learn over the course of your playthrough. However, if puzzles are not for you, the dungeons could be a bit tedious.\n\nMy only complaints about Crosscode is its length and the combat. \n\nThe game is quite long, requiring about 60 hours to beat the main story and all side missions. The side quests are cool, but get pretty repetitive after a while, and don't give out very good rewards. The open world sections of the game are really well made, but require a lot of repetitive backtracking if you mess up and miss a jump during one of the many parkour challenges. Some players may also struggle to discern what areas of the level are traversable due to having verticality in a 2D game.\n\nEvery scripted combat sequence has a very specific method you are supposed to use to beat each enemy. At times I felt like I was being railroaded into using a specific tactic rather than having the flexibility to choose my build. Some enemies also felt way too tanky causing combat to drag on forever. If combat is not for you, the devs also added accessibility slider for players who want to skip the challenge and see the story.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Crosscode to anyone who loves

I understand that they are there to enhance the experience of \"being inside a game\" but that doesn't make it good, like this is literally why I don't like MMOs. \n\nAdd to the fact that the level design is incredibly puzzling and tedious to explore because every new area you have to platform and parkour through a maze of obstacles and it's genuinely confusing to even find a proper path at times due to the depth perception of the platforms, getting around the world itself is a puzzle. Speaking of puzzles, there's an over abundance of them too which really slows down the pacing and most of them require precision aiming and are also incredibly tedious. The game feels more like a puzzle game with RPG mechanics thrown in and not the other way around.\n\nHowever all of that is still not nearly as annoying as how damn grindy the game is, you know...Just like a real MMO. Like they call them \"side quests\" but you're basically expected to do all of them otherwise you won't even be proper level or have good enough gear to take on the main quests so they barely even feel optional at that point.\n\nI hear the story gets more interesting, but right now there's nothing about this game that captivates me enough to want to push through it. I also feel like a lot of my problems stem from the fact that I just don't like MMOs in general and what a shocker that the game where you play a character inside of a fictional MMO actually plays like a real MMO. So I just don't think the game is for me which is super disappointing because the pixel art, character sprites and music are all great and I enjoy the flow of combat and sense of progression too, but everything else is just a complete slog to get through.

Crosscode is a gigantic game, stuffed to the brim with content, that is in my opinion, both a blessing and a curse.\n\nFirst, let's start with the good. Which is QUITE A LOT:\n\nThe Story... It's incredible! While it feels light-hearted at first, it touches some deep existential themes and will leave you thinking quite a few times. The way the story is told is very consistent, all the main characters are well written, have great visual designs, their dialogues are consistent, and it's fun to see their development as the story goes on, but they never lose sight of who they really are... [spoiler] As cynical as this sounds for this game. [/spoiler]\n\nIt plays great, it has good, precise movement, awesome combat, and great interactivity. The combat is just exceptional, it has those elements, long range, short range, and the special arts are just pure insanity (especially level 3). The enemies and bosses are usually great, some aren't (more on that later), but most of the bosses felt beatable and fair, even though HARD AF.\n\nCrossWorld oozes charm, the world of the game has several different regions that look and feel awesome to explore, and that aligned with the awesome graphics, incredible pixel art, and a great soundtrack, makes the experience one level above other games of the genre. All maps are fun, feels metroidvania-ish, but it's not really that. The cities are well designed and nice to explore too. It's supreme!\n\nSome mixed feelings:\n\nWell, Crosscode is not an easy game, it's clear from the deep combat and powerful enemies that Radical Fish expected you to suffer a little, and it's fine. There are a few things I don't like, like enemies that fly or go below the ground, those can be boring to beat, but there's always an easy way to kill those. It's a fair combat, some bosses are brutally punishing, but nothing is unfair or has issues with telegraphy. Also, it's pretty rare to get hit out-of-screen, but it can happen sometimes.\n\nAs for the bad:\n\nThe puzzles, oh boy... You need to have a huge brain to beat CrossCode without help from guides or something. Even some chests require you to have a degree in 4D chess to obtain. And hard puzzles are not a problem, I like puzzles! BUT, like I said, CrossCode has CONTENT, it's a huge game, and yea these hard puzzles everywhere and at all times can get very frustrating and annoying.\n\nThe dungeons are immense, some with over 1 hour long, filled with pixel-precision puzzles and unique powerful enemies. Yea, these get annoying too, especially in that part where there are 3 dungeons in a row. I don't like when my open-world game restricts me into a dungeon for that long.\n\nNow, my biggest gripe with this game is the controls. Seriously, I [b]HATE[/b] the controls. It feels subpar on kb/m, and it also feels subpar on gamepads. You need to be precise, but the melee combat in the keyboard is just HORRENDOUS, you need to keep the cursor above Lea while using the direction in the board to attack in that direction. Why not use M1 for Melee and M2 for Ranged? I just don't get it, and you can't rebind mouse buttons too. I had to keep switching between gamepad and kb/m, so it was gamepad for combat and kb/m for puzzles and menu navigation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the end, CrossCode took me around 60 hours to beat (save time), which is quite a lot. In Steam, I have logged almost 93 hours, but that's mostly because I got tired of the game on some occasions and went to watch a video or do something else with the game open. Honestly, I feel like it overstays its welcome a little, but it is not that the game is filled with filler, it's just too much to do and discover. The DLC has a good change of pace, so it gets better. The DLC dungeon is by far the absolute best of the game (more on that in the DLC review). Overall, I think CrossCode is one of the best indies around. While it has its flaws, the good parts are just too damn good. I love and cherish this kind of game, with true creativity that pushes the boundaries forward.\u00a0\n\nWith all that said, Alabaster Dawn is most likely a buy-on-sight situation.", "timestamp_created": 1736731984, "timestamp_updated": 1736732017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185472083": {"recommendationid": "185472083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100334750", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 3242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 838, "playtime_at_review": 3242, "last_played": 1736718705}, "language": "english", "review": "In CrossCode, you will spend 10 minutes trying to parkour for a box, and once you get to it you'll receive 5 healing items and a slightly okay piece of armor", "timestamp_created": 1736718788, "timestamp_updated": 1736718788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185471186": {"recommendationid": "185471186", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973407472", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6426, "playtime_at_review": 11261, "last_played": 1737401653}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't believe I missed this game's existence for the past 6 years.

The art style, music, characters, gameplay, story, everything is perfectly packaged into this 20$ game, i feel bad for even buying this on sale.\nThe game feels refreshing amidst the other RPG's, it throws a lot of features at you right at the start which might be a lot for everyone but it does it so well. All the intricate details about the combat and puzzles are explained great and the game lets you get used to all of it by the time you are faced with tougher challenges, and puzzles.\nNow for the puzzles, either you love them or hate them. Personally if you are looking for only action driven RPG without much of the bus stops that puzzles in this game are, then i would suggest to pass up this game, for me i absolutely loved them. I was never a guy who enjoyed puzzles in games but this game changed my mind, the more you progress through the game the more elements you unlock for combat reasons, but they are not only used brilliantly for combat, they are integral part of solving puzzles in so many different ways aswell, sometimes i appreciated them more than the actual combat.\nCharacters are all written, not perfectly, but in a way that not a SINGLE one of them feel like a side fodder ready to just be used for plot reasons and become forgotten as soon as they fulfill their purpose, all of them have their quirks and character and feel like actual real players of the game and it makes you like them and care about them. The protagonist, Lea, is one of my favorite ones aswell, i've never had expected that a protagonist who can't speak would be the one to show the most emotional connection between herself and the others she gets to know along.\nMusic in this game is absolutely gorgeous, thank you Deniz Akbulut, it always hits the right spot in every single moment, be it the hectic combat or the bop that is the Faj'ro temple while you are running around shooting at the bubbles, or the more dramatic moments in the story, it just hits different.\nCombat is very intricate, there are decent amount of mechanics you need to keep in mind when going into fights, like elemental resistances, what type of build you want to roll with. There are a lot of modifiers which can dictate what kind of playstyle you want to go for, do you want to max out your close range melee mashing damage, or maybe spec into guard type of playstyle where you try to parry most of attack, maybe max out your focus (my favorite) and let your high crits and your constant barrage of attack arts demolish your foes, you can pretty much customize the way you combat however you want and it is amazing. Each element has a certain focus like ice being more defensive and shock being very quick and big damage but that still doesn\u2019t invalidate them in other segments of the combat. Apart from monster slaying you will do, there will be couple PVP (against other character players) battles which in my opinion are the peak of the combat in Crosscode and there you can truly test your skills since they can also use all the tricks you can aswell.\nTLDR: Amazing game, amazing soundtrack, amazing characters, very good story and i adore it, try it if you have the time :)\n",

"review": "As of 2025, one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nFirst, the art - I'm a sucker for pixel art, and CrossCode does pixel art *incredibly well*. You can see the personality in the biomes, the mobs, and especially the characters. A standout example is the main character, Lea - coupled with her inability to speak, her facial expressions through the pixel art really add a lot of charm. For an art style whose *definition* is simplification (due to having less real estate), CrossCode is able to turn that convention of pixel art on its head.\n\nNext, the story, which made me invested. I wanted to see Lea find out more about herself, interact with her friends and overcome obstacles. [spoiler]It also raised some interesting philosophical points on AI, which I appreciated a lot in a sci-fi game.[/spoiler] It does suck that we don't really get to see much of the side characters, but I can't really complain - the main plotline really does immerse you into CrossWorlds.\n\nFinally, the gameplay itself. The puzzles were super satisfying to solve, especially (hear me out) the super frustrating ones. Some of the puzzles involved lots of moving parts, sometimes requiring you to switch between elements and hit targets at precisely the right times. While it is annoying to *just* miss certain timings, making you have to start all over again, I felt a real sense of accomplishment and satisfaction at finishing a precise series of puzzles.\n\nFor the combat, it's your bread-and-butter approach of finding an enemy's weakness and exploiting it to beat them. The game does get really creative with what the weaknesses *are*, which reflects the amount of effort the devs put into CrossCode itself.\n\nBuy CrossCode, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1735924759, "timestamp_updated": 1735924759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184644980": {"recommendationid": "184644980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452908277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 2007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2007, "deck_playtime_at_review": 2007, "last_played": 1736104992}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Ultra good", "timestamp_created": 1735915502, "timestamp_updated": 1736105045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "184639810": {"recommendationid": "184639810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198947811540", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2736, "playtime_at_review": 582, "last_played": 1736821260}, "language": "english", "review": "Top ten Chef Sandwiches:\r\n1.

This is a really, really good game.  From the basic look of it, it actually has no right to be this good.\n\nThe action is very responsive, and the attacks are very much a risk/reward calculation in real time.  Do you blast out that combo but take a hit, or dodge out and save the health?  There are consumables for heals, equipment, teammates, etc.  You get melee attacks, ranged attacks, dashes (which can be outfitted to deal damage as well).  Also the story is actually really fun so far!\nIt does take an hour or two to really unlock all the features, because the game wants to get you used to each mechanic piece by piece... so if you only play for 30 or 40 minutes it is going to seem a bit limited.  But get a couple hours in, get to the first real world area and you'll have things in hand.\n\nThe character models are great, and the art is great.  Overall this is just really, really impressive and I cannot believe it was on sale for like $6 on the winter sale.  Pick this up if you have not already, it is even worth the $20 it normally sells for without question.  Though, yes, I do always wait for sales myself.\n\nAs someone who played games through the late 80's and 90's, this captures the retro vibe more accurately than any other title I've played.  The music, the sound effects, everything is pure nostalgia.  It's kind of glorious in that sense.\n\nI do recommend a gamepad for this one, though I guess it technically isn't required.  But I wouldn't want to play it with just mouse and keyboard.  It has a toggle for xbox or ps gamepad control layout so that it references your buttons correctly.  The only downside is that other than that toggle, there is no control remapping I can find.  You use the buttons the devs wanted you to, regardless of how you feel about it.  I was a bit miffed, because I'm so used to 'b' being dash in my other games, but in this one I have to accept 'a' as dash.  I mean it is what it is, but it's a valid critique in my book.

It's like experience the same story again but now we got EXTRA content!\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- The control, using controller, can be a bit awkward, especially during long range attack. And since this is used for puzzle, it is actually very very hard. It's really tough trying to aim properly using the controller. Though, I suppose this is not exactly the developer fault since I dont think there's any better way to do it. And luckily the puzzle speed can be reduced to help.\r\n- The height of the platform can sometime be difficult to tell. Which one has the same height that I can jump to? Which one is lower so we have to avoid? Which one we cant reach? Currently I have to use the long range attack to test the height but if I dont I usually get disoriented.

I bought it on a whim on a Switch eShop sale and fell so deeply in love with it that I bought the game a second time just to have it on PC. It's that good.\nThe dedication put into this game shows throughout the whole thing, from the little in-jokes and references to the genuinely amazing story. I'm not joking when I say that during my 1st playthrough on switch, I cried, laughed, felt most emotions that media makes me feel; and then I felt it AGAIN on my second playthrough here. This game's story and characters are so well done; and the gameplay is no slouch, either! It's incredibly smooth and satisfying to play (when I'm not getting my face handed to me by overleveled foes or stumped by a puzzle; one of my only gripes is that this game is HARD sometimes). The combat is admittedly not really as deep as advertised imo, since I often felt like I was just swinging away at the enemy and dodging occasionally, along with switching up elements sometimes, but what's here is so fun that I don't really care if it's not super deep. Against strong enemies, the game starts to feel almost souls-like in a way, with how I would keep dying and learning how to better combat them. And once you hit your first S-Rank killstreak you can never go back man, it's so fun! That's not even getting into the puzzles and exploration, both of which are very fun, and the sheer amount of sidequesting material to be found.\nWhat I'm trying got say is this: PLAY CROSSCODE RIGHT NOW!! You wont regret it.\n(oh but don't play this w/ keyboard & mouse. There's no autofire on keyboard & mouse so you have to click every time you fire projectiles and it sucks. Play with controller instead, since controllers have autofire and it is so much better.
