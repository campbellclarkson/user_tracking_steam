Whether you're reliving the classic battles of the original trilogy or exploring the origins of beloved characters in the prequels, the game delivers a delightful blend of puzzle-solving, action, and quirky humor.\r\n\r\nOne thing worth noting is that the store page still refers to the game as having \"all the movies.\" While this was true at the time of its release (hence the name The Complete Saga), it doesn't hold true anymore since the sequels have since been released. Updating the store page to clarify this would help avoid any confusion for new players.\r\n\r\nDespite this small oversight, the game remains a must-play for fans of LEGO, Star Wars, or both.

dose of jank. 4/5 [/h3]\n\n[i] On my scale, a 4/5 game is great. It goes beyond simply \u201cgood\u201d and elevates the experience with a solid story, a particularly noteworthy process of development, and/or innovations in mechanics which are satisfying to figure out and implement. [/i]\n\nBy far the majority of people who are looking at this game in 2025 are doing so because they grew up playing this version of Lego Star Wars, so the vast majority of you need no introduction to what this game is.\n\nSo a quick little summary for those of you who may not know: this is one of the original releases of Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga. It is [i] not [/i] the true original, as attested to by two of the actual original levels you can unlock when collecting enough gold bricks, but the few changes they have made (like those levels) are generally QOL improvements and the addition of extra challenge levels/content. Either that or I never got as far as the bonus levels as a kid, lol.\n\nThis is a perfect Steam Deck game. I played it through to 90%, including all gold bricks, on the deck and it worked perfectly. I could have done the blue minikits too, but by that point I had already played through all the levels at least twice and was like \u201cok that\u2019s enough.\u201d Maybe I\u2019ll go back one day, but not now.\n\nBiggest downside to the Steam Deck platform is the lack of multiplayer, but if you\u2019re playing on the Deck you probably don\u2019t have someone to split screen with. If you do, however, the true classic Lego Star Wars experience is the good old split keyboard arrangement, preferably with a sibling that you can kill repeatedly for taking your studs (money). \n\nIt has a lot of charm and a lot of content, although if you are playing efficiently you can beat the game fast, probably in about 20-25 hours (I was not playing efficiently, I was playing like a greedy loot goblin collecting each silver stud as if my life depended on it). \n\nThis is a great game for kids to play together (most of the time, see above killing each other comment) and even for kids to play with their parents. I remember this game for playing with both my brother and my dad, and it is a very straightforward game with linear levels but many puzzles. I do own the Skywalker Saga version of Lego Star Wars, but have yet to play it and cannot give a good point of comparison. \n\n In some cases, you can solve the puzzles through unintended means. My favorite example is in the Episode 4 tuskan raider level: I didn't think to use the creature to reach the ledge where you access the red brick and instead got up there after 15 minutes of trying to position myself on flowers. There aren\u2019t many of these cases, but there are enough for you to do them accidentally and then be like \u201coh I wasn\u2019t supposed to do it that way.\u201d\n\nIt does show its age in a few places. You cannot skip cutscenes even after playing through the story once, some minikits are very lazy compared to others which have entire elaborate puzzle rooms built around them, studs can have weird pickup hitboxes/radius, the bonus levels are almost entirely ass, and there is very little reason to replay completed levels after collecting all the minikits via free play. By the time you actually have all of the extras, you don\u2019t really have any reason to use them at all, which is kinda sad and disappointing. I remember there being more to do in this game from when I was a kid, but I think that was because I was mainly killing my brother and fooling around and having fun, without also factoring in some degree of \u201cI can complete this\u201d mindset. \n\nNow, is this nearly 15 years-old game worth $20? Ehhh. If you\u2019re super nostalgic about it, then full-heartedly, yes. If you have someone you plan on playing this split-screen with, then also yes. If you\u2019re going to play this alone and/or you just like Lego games in general, then my recommendation is wait for a sale. Very worth even at $10 and it has gone down to that area a few times. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I paid for it, but I\u2019m pretty sure it was less than $10. Wait for that and you have a very well worth little game on your hands.", "timestamp_created": 1736899995, "timestamp_updated": 1736899995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "185605768": {"recommendationid": "185605768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830609049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1933, "playtime_at_review": 1424, "last_played": 1737064147}, "language": "english", "review": "It's made really well with a bunch of levels that make you think.

classic. It is one of the most iconic video games of all time, especially for Star Wars fans and LEGO fans. I have quite the history with this game, as the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game (2005) was one of my first experiences with video games and Star Wars. Many others have given this game the praise it deserves for being a faithful and fun adaptation of the original six films. I am a huge fan of the gameplay, how you can play as all of your favorite characters and even the customizer is fun. Basic, but fun. My biggest issue with this game, however, is the post-story content. While the hub is fun and I like free play, the challenge modes and especially the Super Story segments of the game are a drag. You don't receive any benefit and it makes you replay these levels over and over again, which is not terrible since they're fun and enjoyable levels, but it just gets tiring after a while. Overall, however, this game is a classic for a reason, and I love it with all my heart. I only knock it down a tiny bit due to the Super Stories and Challenge mode. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1735373250, "timestamp_updated": 1735373250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648876428604125977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183963363": {"recommendationid": "183963363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195710101", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 496, "last_played": 1736132660}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 LEGO kkk\r\nCom mod grafico esse jogo tras uma nostalgia grande e ainda fica bonito igual os legos atuais.\r\n\r\nJogo b\u00e3o", "timestamp_created": 1735373037, "timestamp_updated": 1735373037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183952104": {"recommendationid": "183952104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022041905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 216, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1734894784}, "language": "english", "review": "I can relive my childhood with friends thanks to steam remote play\n\ngameplay has NOT aged well, probably only worth it for the nostalgia factor (but still worth it because we're /that/ nostalgic for lego star wars)", "timestamp_created": 1735362121, "timestamp_updated": 1735362121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183946329": {"recommendationid": "183946329", "author": {"steamid": "76561199279051508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1736850796}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "topzera vtnc fases originais\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735357102, "timestamp_updated": 1735357102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183946298": {"recommendationid": "183946298", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213071385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1711157438}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than skywalker saga by miles, amazing character roster, good hub, but its insanely easy so it could get boring after a while. only really worth it if you're a star wars fan", "timestamp_created": 1735357075, "timestamp_updated": 1735357075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183943210": {"recommendationid": "183943210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107686311", "num_games_owned": 741, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1575950354}, "language": "english", "review": "I knew these games inside and out as a kid", "timestamp_created": 1735354388, "timestamp_updated": 1735354388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183941088": {"recommendationid": "183941088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057335613", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1736540642}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy recommend.
