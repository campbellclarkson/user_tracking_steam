Now it might make some people upset that the mechanics of this game aren't the most lore-friendly, being that this game is the only case where we can grow spikes out of our backs, but Nirn [spoiler] canonically isn't real, [/spoiler] I say anything goes.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that make your character, race, and class, race has some stat effects and its own set of passive skills you can unlock, while classes will give you exclusive skills that are both active and passive. Each class has 3 skill categories, their DPS skills, their Tank skills, and their Support skills. DPS skills do damage, duh, and apply effects onto enemies, Tank skills draw aggro and protect you from damage, and then support skills provide utility to your group, not always just healing, but still mostly healing. Then there are weapon skills which are attacks and passives exclusive to that weapon, and then there are armor skills which are just passive and improve the performance of armor, and then there's a whole load of secondary skills that are unlocked by doing certain activities and are by far the most painful to progress, especially the crafting skills. The combat-related skills can be very fun to progress as you try to figure out your playstyle and optimize your character, but the rest of them are a huge pain, they involve immense repetition and it can get very stale, very quickly, but the payoff is pretty good, having a well-made character is super fun to play with, especially in a group.\r\n\r\nYour gear is another very important thing, there are a few ways to obtain weapons and armor: Craft it, find it, receive it as a quest reward or random drop. The gear you're gonna want is gonna belong to sets, which give you stat buffs depending on how many pieces of the set you have equipped, and based on how many stat buffs a set maxes out at, you can get about 2-3 full set bonuses when fully kitted out. You have 2 weapons, 6 armor pieces, and 3 jewelry slots (2 rings and one necklace). Pieces of a set can be obtained two ways, boss drops in dungeons and then crafting, and there is no overlap, specific sets can only be found in dungeons while the others can only be crafted at specific stations in specific parts of Tamriel, some of which require DLCs to access. But it doesn't matter how you end up getting your gear, crafting is very important. Crafting is super simple, you only need two types of items to make it, the item which determines the quality of your gear which just determines the level of your gear and then the style material which is purely cosmetic but you still need one to craft anything, just one style material per item though, so don't worry. In order to craft higher level gear you need the necessary skills unlocked in the crafting category for that specifc type of crafting, there are 7, 4 of them are for gear, the other 3 or for consumables, each takes their own materials (except style materials) and need to be leveled up separately, this can be done by crafting items that belong it that category, disassembling gear, (gear made from other players and gear with bonuses listed for disassembling will give you the most XP for it) and doing writ quests, which require you to craft some specific items for rewards, you get one per crafting category per day. You can also put secondary effects on gear, which require their own items which you find through various means, and the only way to craft gear with these effects is to destroy gear with the effect to research it, which is put on a timer, which is an exponential increase each time you do it, going up to a month, it's really not that fun. The grind for gear is probably one of the most tedious parts about it, it's not hard, just time consuming, use some add-ons if you don't want to be searching forever for crafting materials, Zenimax allows it so it's fine.\r\n\r\nThe actual gameplay is actually quite fun, you end up getting two weapon slots for double the amount of skills you can use, just push a button to swap weapons and now you have different skills to use, what I often do is have my setup skills on one weapon while all of my attacks are on another. The name of the game is use your skills effectively, most classes have a \"spam skill\" that you're meant to use repeatedly when you're not using something else, and some classes are built around the spam skill, like the Arcanist, where each time you use the spam skill, you generate something called crux, and some skills consume it, and they get more powerful the more crux it consumes, I really like it and I think it's super fun. The game is most fun when played with a group, dungeons are 4 players, and then Trials are 15, and Trials are my favorite, especially when they're planned well, and it feels super good to win them, its really where the MMORPG magic shines. I also don't recommend playing in first person, it might feel more like Elder Scrolls that way, but you're putting yourself at a disadvantage, you'll be losing a lot of sight that way, and the game seems built around third person despite defaulting to first.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are much more cartoony than the other Elder Scrolls games, they don't look bad necessarily, Elder Scrolls games never looked that bad when compared to games of the time, but the ESO artstyle is different, and I think it fits well.\r\n\r\nThe Soundtrack isn't super special, it's mostly just rehashes of old songs from the series, but that doesn't stop it from sounding pretty good, all Orchestral and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThe writing in this game is pretty balls, it's very clear that story was not a huge concern for Zenimax, at least not in the dialogue, I never bothered listening to it, the stories were never that engaging, some of the story moments can be really cool, be it the bossfights or the end of the main story, but overall it leaves a lot to be desired, I love good stories, games like RDR2 and Cyberpunk 2077 have some of my favorite stories and my ears were wide open and listening to all the dialogue even though the games were dozens of hours long each.\r\n\r\nThis game is not lacking in content by any means, the base game alone will give you a couple dozen hours, both by doing the main story and going through all of the zone stories, I'd recommend doing a good chunk of the Base Game before deciding on buying any DLCs.\r\n\r\nThe DLCs in this game are a bit strange, first are the chapters, these are the big DLCs and they add the most content, usually in the form of new classes and mechanics, each chapter comes with a new Trial, a new area to explore, new quests, a new story, etc. After a chapter releases, soon after we get some smaller, follow-up DLC, these will be in the form of zone and dungeon DLCs, zone DLCs add new areas with new quests and story while the Dungeon DLCs add new replayable dungeons to grind for items in, neither Zone or Dungeon DLCs add new mechanics or classes, but these follow-up DLCs are also usually continuations of the Chapter DLC's story, if you care about that at all.\r\n\r\nThis game's community is a mixed bag, there are the enjoyers, and then the complainers, you'll see the enjoyers actually playing the game and are a part of a guild to do dungeons and trials with and help their fellow players out, while the complainers usually stick to the forums to bitch about whatever complaints they have, and sure, their complaints are valid, but I

"spanish", "review": "The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) es un MMORPG ambicioso que promete capturar la esencia de la legendaria saga de Bethesda en un formato multijugador masivo. Sin embargo, la experiencia puede ser un arma de doble filo dependiendo de tus expectativas.\n\nLo positivo:\n\nUn mundo vasto y hermoso: Tamriel est\u00e1 incre\u00edblemente detallado, con biomas variados, ciudades ic\u00f3nicas y una atm\u00f3sfera que remite a los juegos principales.\n\nContenido inmenso: ESO ofrece a\u00f1os de expansiones, DLCs y actualizaciones que han agregado m\u00e1s zonas, historias y mec\u00e1nicas. Si eres fan de la narrativa y las misiones secundarias, encontrar\u00e1s cientos de horas de entretenimiento.\n\nFlexibilidad de clases y combate: El sistema de habilidades es muy personalizable, lo que permite experimentar con diferentes builds y estilos de juego.\n\nExperiencia cooperativa: Aunque puedes jugar solo, las mazmorras, pruebas y PvP brillan m\u00e1s con amigos o una buena guild.\n\nLo negativo:\nEconom\u00eda desbalanceada: ESO sufre del temido modelo \"buy-to-play + microtransacciones\". Aunque la suscripci\u00f3n mensual no es obligatoria, sin ella te sentir\u00e1s limitado en aspectos clave como la capacidad de inventario, la recolecci\u00f3n de materiales y el acceso a ciertas zonas. Adem\u00e1s, la tienda de coronas est\u00e1 plagada de cosm\u00e9ticos y \"conveniencias\" que bordean lo abusivo.\n\nInicio confuso para nuevos jugadores: La curva de aprendizaje puede ser brutal. Si eres nuevo en el g\u00e9nero o en la franquicia, las mec\u00e1nicas y sistemas te abrumar\u00e1n r\u00e1pidamente.\n\nProblemas t\u00e9cnicos: A pesar de los a\u00f1os, ESO no est\u00e1 exento de bugs, ca\u00eddas de servidores y tiempos de carga largos. Esto puede romper la inmersi\u00f3n y frustrar a quienes buscan una experiencia fluida.\n\nRepetici\u00f3n y \"grindeo\": Aunque las historias principales suelen ser interesantes, muchas actividades secundarias se sienten como un trabajo mon\u00f3tono (cosechar materiales, farmear cofres, etc.).\n\nPvP inconsistente: La experiencia en Cyrodiil (zona de guerra PvP) es irregular, con problemas de lag masivo en las batallas a gran escala.\n\nVeredicto:\nThe Elder Scrolls Online puede ser una experiencia fant\u00e1stica si eres fan de la saga, amas los mundos abiertos y tienes paciencia para lidiar con un modelo econ\u00f3mico que no siempre es amable. Sin embargo, no es un juego para todos. Si buscas algo m\u00e1s casual o menos dependiente de suscripciones y compras adicionales, tal vez este no sea el MMORPG para ti.\n\nPuntuaci\u00f3n: 7/10\nUn mundo hermoso con alma, pero atrapado en las garras de su modelo de negocio y algunos problemas t\u00e9cnicos persistentes.", "timestamp_created": 1737288769, "timestamp_updated": 1737288769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

But I will summarize my issues and as always take with salt. \r\n\r\n1. Game play. I am only level 25 so perhaps it gets more complex. But its the same tired 'I have five skills on a bar' type of game play that was pretty dated with WoW. Its not the model per se; diablo IV uses that approach with a degree of success. Its that the skills don't really work together in any meaningful way. You for example don't seem to take a skill and then create a build around that skill (aka POE and Diablo). I have an attack skill for my sword, a movement skill, a defensive skill. all of which are just sort of meh\r\n\r\n2. Build creation. I don't expect POE level complexity, but so far its basically a bunch of pretty bland skills that all seem pretty meh, and dont really evolve that much as you level them. I mean mutating a skill into A or B, with pretty slight differences between the two options, is not exactly robust build creation here. \r\n\r\n3. Leveling experience. Run from quest to question, do something. Watch your leveling bar slowly creep up. Back and forth, back and forth. Again it's not that its 'bad' but seriously its basically cut and paste MMO's from 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n4. The basic game engine. You feel like a rag doll, floating across the field, getting stuck on every blade of grass. Nothing has any weight or sense of impact. \r\n\r\n5. The UI. O sweet gods, the UI. It makes me want to claw my eyes out. \r\n\r\nNow all of these complaints are a bit unfair. To me this feels like an old, dated MMO that has simply not kept up with the times.  It is also the simplest game I think I have ever played. \r\n\r\nSo those are my complaints, but I hesitate to call it 'bad'. Clearly there are positives: The game works, there are tons of people in the game itself, and it has been around for years. So clearly there are things that lots of folks do like. \r\n\r\nPerhaps just unfortunate that I could not see those positives during my (limited) time.", "timestamp_created": 1736990004, "timestamp_updated": 1736990004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510945498943328857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185681761": {"recommendationid": "185681761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079344799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1299, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1737411810}, "language": "english", "review": "lots to do very fun\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736989964, "timestamp_updated": 1736989964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185678211": {"recommendationid": "185678211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345332757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 810, "playtime_at_review": 944, "last_played": 1737412231}, "language": "spanish", "review": "lokuraaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "timestamp_created": 1736984945, "timestamp_updated": 1736984945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185672443": {"recommendationid": "185672443", "author": {"steamid": "76561199423056951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6849, "playtime_at_review": 727, "last_played": 1737412379}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a Skyrim fan, I LOVE this game!", "timestamp_created": 1736977655, "timestamp_updated": 1736977655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185670865": {"recommendationid": "185670865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245773818", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 95155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95155, "last_played": 1728817717}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u044c\u044e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b.", "timestamp_created": 1736975821, "timestamp_updated": 1736975821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185669619": {"recommendationid": "185669619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019146783", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 52568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2163, "playtime_at_review": 51851, "deck_playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1737309731}, "language": "english", "review": "Game started out great and is now dying.

The staff don't know how to fix the old spaghetti code so the game runs terribly with frequent launcher issues and crashing issues.  Sometimes you just won't be able to play until the next launcher update.  The questing is very boring so you'll find yourself skipping through all their expensive voiced dialogue they boast about having.  Combat can be fun sometimes but PvP builds are simply hard to keep up with.  They removed group cuing for Battle Grounds because their programmers couldn't fix the bugs in the group cuing system and gave up, making Battle Grounds pointless and really ruining PvP for me.  They also ruined Imperial City PvP zone.  If you like running in a zerg and sieging forts, that's the only PvP experience that can be some fun if the game runs properly. More and more new game assets are poorly designed reskins.  Housing is pretty much the only thing this game does well except they kneecapped the item limit to be the same as that of console versions.  \r\n\r\nMy main reason for doing PvE group content was for PvP gear, so without that carrot I feel very unmotivated.  All I do is farm mats and sell them, and decorate my houses at this point.\r\n\r\nAll of this while the game is painful to play without a Plus subscription due to artificial limitations placed on storage to force you to sub.  I swear I only have so many hours due to a combination of forgetting the launcher open, farming to support my housing addiction, and pure sunk loss fallacy.  With my launcher woes that have become more and more frequent I think I might finally just give up on this game.  It was at least comfy for it's familiarity, but now is a source of such frustration that I can not justify spending around a hundred bucks for a year's subscription.  In fact, I wish i could get a refund on my last year's worth of Plus, since I so often can not even get the game to work.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I have a decent gaming computer that plays other games fine.  It's 110% a Zenimax problem, and I hope their workers who just voted to unionize mostly get the ax.  The only ones who seem competent are the furniture designers and zone asset designers, no joke.

The lag and atrocious server performance are inexcusable for a game this size. Every time there\u2019s an issue, they trot out the same tired excuse: \u201cIt\u2019s a DDOS attack.\u201d At this point, that explanation feels more like a running joke. Face it, Zenimax\u2014it\u2019s your subpar servers.\n\nThe overland difficulty is practically non-existent. It\u2019s a theme park for players who want to stroll through quests without any challenge.

Forget about it. The only thing Zenimax reliably churns out is new items for the cash shop. And let\u2019s talk about those loot boxes\u2014a sleazy, exploitative tactic designed to milk money from players.

The fact you have to animation cancel every single action you take with a basic attack to be optimal is a stupid game design and an unimmersive element. That big shiny new spell you casted? Immediately cancel the animation or you lost dps output. For those unaware people expect you to download an add on for raids or upper level play that shows you when to animation cancel, and if you don't do it, you are performing extremely suboptimal. Getting max level gear is artificially gated behind a silly post max level leveling system that doesnt feel rewarding to go through, just a \"muscle through this\" feeling. Structured PvP scene is dead and its impractical to believe you will be able to get a queue in with your friends in under 10 minutes. Not reminiscent of Oblivion or Skyrim. Graphics are disappointing. The community was nice though. After putting 400+ hours in I would say avoid. If you are enticed by the \"action\" combat I'd try New World.

Played heavily on console before switching to PC. Overall, I think this game is great, but your enjoyment will depend heavily on what you are looking for. If you love Elder Scrolls lore and quests, then this is a game for you. I primarily play solo, but there is plenty of dungeons, group content, and trials (this game's version of raids) to do. Some quest lines are better than others, but some of my favorite stories have been found in this game. There's also multiple types of PVP, but I have limited experience with that since I tend to not do PVP in MMOs.\r\n\r\nI think this game has some of the best character customization of all the major mmos right now, but it can be a bit complex. Classes are more of a thematic choice than anything else with every class being able to fill any of the three roles. Then there are more skill lines you can unlock as you play through quest lines. Every class can use every weapon with each weapon type having it's own skill line. Then when you hit level 50, you unlock the Champion system which allows you to fine tune your character. Of course you can look up builds, but I find it more fun to experiment, respecing frequently, and finding different combos that work. However, depending on your build, you can quickly become overpowered with a lot of content. There is harder content in this game, but most of the quests will be a breeze. This does get a little disappointing when you spend hours enjoying a questline that has been building up a major enemy. Only for them to take 30 seconds to fight because of how easy they are to beat. \r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind if you are interested in playing is how the monetization works. You can buy the starter edition which gives you the base game and the Morrowind chapter. This hundreds of hours of content, but there's also going to be a lot of other content that comes with the later DLCs and there's a lot of them. You can pay for the monthly subscription and get access to everything and earn the premium currency every month. This is the more standard MMO experience like WOW or FFXIV where you have to pay monthly no matter what. This will not give you the most recent chapter though. Of course you can also just buy the expansions that you want to play, a la carte style. The biggest issue I have with this is that the craft bag is locked behind the sub. This makes non-sub players really struggle with inventory management as the game has become bloated with crafting materials. This is great if you really like crafting and pay for the sub, but will quickly become frustrating with inventory management if you don't pay.\r\n\r\nThe future of the game is also at an interesting point. I'm choosing to remain optimistic with it, but we will see with time. They've announced that Gold Road will be the last chapter and they are changing their content model to seasons instead. Many people have labeled this as the game going into \"maintenence mode\". I don't think that is the case as Bethesda has another game that uses the season model instead of expansions: Fallout 76. Love that game or hate it, it has gotten a lot of good content over the years with this model. But that is to be seen with what it will look like with ESO. \r\n\r\nMy only other biggest issue is just how often I have trouble logging in. I constantly get the error that there is an unexpected internal error and it won't let me log in. Nothing will ever fix this issue. I just have to wait for a bit and try again and usually I'm able to log in. Not the end of the world, but it is an annoying regular issue.", "timestamp_created": 1736714836, "timestamp_updated": 1736714836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185450160": {"recommendationid": "185450160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054117498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 686, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1737194944}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f88\u597d\u3002\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9b54\u517d\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u73a9\u3002\u4e5f\u4e0d\u70e7\u94b1", "timestamp_created": 1736699267, "timestamp_updated": 1736699267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185441856": {"recommendationid": "185441856", "author": {"steamid": "76561199654278855", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 14198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 453, "playtime_at_review": 13963, "last_played": 1737406154}, "language": "german", "review": "ich habe mit skyrim angefangen  und  bin froh mir eso gekauft zu haben es isteine andere erfahrung als ein singelplayer nat\u00fcrlich, aber ich finde es sehr detailert und das jeder npc vertont ist ist so befriedigend, noch dazu feier ich pers\u00f6hnlich die bardenlieder in den tavernen", "timestamp_created": 1736692448, "timestamp_updated": 1736692448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185438907": {"recommendationid": "185438907", "author": {"steamid": "76561199493478562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3759, "playtime_at_review": 5825, "last_played": 1737408768}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good MMO.

It's probably the most immersive MMORPG I've played. The combat\r\nfeels better than it looks, though its very frustrating that your class choice feels useless since most of your\r\nbuild will end up coming from skill lines available to all classes, and ever since Arcanists release, all the other\r\nclasses feel dead compared to it. Dragon Knight is second place in terms of still being worth playing, but by and large, the rest of the classes, especially necromancer, just suck to play. For the record, I'm talking about my experience in PvE, as I don't do ESO PvP. \r\n\r\nThe weapon skill animations especially feel lackluster, bow is the worst offender with its light and heavy attack animation. Scribing allows us to- in a VERY limited capacity that effectively amounts to yet another cash grab- change the color of SOME skills. But its a far cry from the animation overhaul that was needed.\r\n\r\nSome of the more recent systems are cool ideas, like scribing, that have been implemented quite poorly. Instead of changing up your skills like it sounded like at first, it just gives you a new skill in each category \r\nthat you can tweak after you unlock it. Players are getting really tired of the microtransactions, its especially bad for new players that don't know what to expect from zos. There is a lot of bloat in the crown store that is really just there to scam unsuspecting players, things that are not, and will never be worth your Crowns ($) and Gems (gambling scraps). There remain many design choices that are just stupid and hinder players. You charge crowns to gift something to a friend, only to find out that your account- which has been in good standing since BETA in 2014- is not eligible to gift crownstore items. Apparently you have to file a support ticket just to ask to gift things with your already spent money. So many things in this game are so much more of a hassle than they need to be. If the developers have any common sense, it is overruled by the\r\nfinance team and reduced to r**ard level choices by the time it reaches the players.\r\n\r\nThe gambling is especially bad. The things you are spending 80$+ to try and get are so rare that you will never get them unless you sink multiple hundreds trying. Admittedly you can farm Seals and get things\r\nthat way, but its very, very, very slow. You need 16,000 seals for a radiant mount, and you can farm only 30 per day with a bonus of 250 per week. On top of this, you only have three months before the stock changes,\r\nPersonally, every time I have gambled- I am left with nothing but immense regret and cosmetics that aren't what I wanted and will never use. \r\n\r\nThe community is fairly good. Most people are willing to help a newbie out, crafters will be happy to craft for you if ask politely. Guilds are constantly recruiting and the playerbase is active. It can be a bit tough to learn some of the dungeons as veteran players speedrun them so aggressively that you wont be able to keep up or have time to learn mechanics unless you look up a guide, which isn't a big deal given that most of this is decade old content, but it is a hurdle for newer players.\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with DEI content, ESO has it. There isn't alot, but you see bits of it here and there. Especially with some of the npc companion quests. (unlockable AI party members)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the game is still very good, but it is weighed down by cash grab design choices and a lack of QoL you would expect in a ten year old game. Many games have a lot of potential but fail to truly reach anything close to what they can be. This is true of ESO even more than usual. The game world is truly massive, and beautiful, but the game systems and available activities outside of combat truly fail to capitalize on the world they have crafted.\r\n\r\nI don't regret my time spent on ESO. I don't regret buying it. I do regret every penny I've spent on micro-transactions, because the gambling and baiting is just that bad. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend anyone new to MMORPGs to try it, it would be gruesomely frustrating for them. And for anyone who is an MMO veteran, proceed with caution. The game is good, but it is not even in the same reality as the concept of \"user friendly\".\r\n\r\nLast word? If you love Elder scrolls type gameplay, you will find ESO to be an amusing attempt to spin it into an MMORPG. It falls far short of the singleplayer games, but it can still be a good time in the same world with the same or similar concepts. And you get to share it with other players. Sometimes that means fighting them for chest spawns, sometimes that means partnering up with strangers to raid public dungeons. My final bit of advice? If you have never played ESO and want to start, find a friend who knows the game to help you. Navigating this particular MMORPG is as dangerous as any dungeon, with far more traps set by the developers to waste your time and steal your money. Most of them can be avoided if you are aware of them.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736449509, "timestamp_updated": 1736449509, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522205471992492676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185198308": {"recommendationid": "185198308", "author": {"steamid": "76561199333871625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4050, "playtime_at_review": 1807, "last_played": 1737351867}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Maravillosa aventura; un mundo entero para hacer turismo de fantas\u00eda y magia, con su toque de combate...

Das klingt gro\u00dfartig, und viele Spieler sch\u00e4tzen genau diese Vielseitigkeit. Doch trotz der vielen Optionen f\u00fchlte sich das Gameplay oft leer und repetitiv an. In der weiten Welt von Tamriel gibt es unz\u00e4hlige Quests, aber es war nicht immer die Art von Abenteuer, die mich packte. Vielleicht liegt es an meiner Vorliebe f\u00fcr die Einzelspielererfahrungen der Elder Scrolls-Reihe, aber Online-RPGs haben einfach nicht denselben Charme f\u00fcr mich.\nErz\u00e4hle deine eigene Geschichte \u2013 Aber irgendwie mit weniger Magie\n\nDie M\u00f6glichkeit, deine eigene Geschichte zu erleben, ist ein zentraler Bestandteil von ESO. Die Erz\u00e4hlweise und die Struktur des Spiels bieten dir eine tiefe und komplexe Geschichte, die in vielen Aspekten faszinierend ist. Doch irgendwie fehlte mir die Magie, die Skyrim oder Oblivion f\u00fcr mich so besonders gemacht haben. Es war nicht nur die Epik der Erz\u00e4hlung, die fehlte \u2013 es war auch das Gef\u00fchl von Isolation und Entdeckung. In ESO l\u00e4uft alles in gro\u00dfen, oft \u00fcberf\u00fcllten Online-Welten ab, und das Gef\u00fchl, ein echter Held in einer lebendigen Welt zu sein, wurde leider ein wenig durch die st\u00e4ndige Pr\u00e4senz anderer Spieler getr\u00fcbt.\nDie technischen Aspekte \u2013 Frustrationen, die die Freude tr\u00fcben\n\nEin weiterer Punkt, der mir schwer auf den Schultern lag, waren die konstanten Updates und die enorme Dateigr\u00f6\u00dfe des Spiels. Mit \u00fcber 130 GB zu Beginn und zus\u00e4tzlichen 100 GB f\u00fcr Updates, ist es kaum zu fassen, wie viel Speicherplatz dieses Spiel einnimmt. Wenn man bedenkt, dass gerade in einer Zeit, in der die Festplattenkapazit\u00e4ten begrenzt sind, solch ein Massivspiel vor einem liegt, ist das eine ziemliche H\u00fcrde. Klar, Updates geh\u00f6ren dazu, aber es ist frustrierend, wenn das Spiel scheinbar nie \u201efertig\u201c ist und immer wieder eine noch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Menge an Speicherplatz verlangt.\nDie Kontroversen \u2013 Politik und DLCs, die den Spa\u00df mindern\n\nDie politische Ausrichtung und die Entscheidungen der Entwickler, die neue, ideologische Themen in das Spiel zu integrieren, haben bei mir ebenfalls f\u00fcr Unbehagen gesorgt. Die Absicht, bestimmte Themen in einem Spiel anzusprechen, mag vielleicht gut gemeint sein, aber ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, dass solche Elemente die Stimmung tr\u00fcben und vom urspr\u00fcnglichen Spa\u00df des Spiels ablenken. Als Spieler will man einfach in eine neue Welt eintauchen und sich nicht mit Themen konfrontiert sehen, die mehr politisch als spielerisch motiviert erscheinen.\n\nZudem haben die st\u00e4ndigen DLCs und Mikrotransaktionen ihren Tribut gefordert. Als jemand, der mit den klassischen \u201ealles-in-einem-Paket\u201c-Spielen gro\u00df geworden ist, war es schwer, mich an das moderne Modell von Online-Spielen zu gew\u00f6hnen, bei dem man f\u00fcr zus\u00e4tzliche Inhalte st\u00e4ndig extra bezahlen muss. F\u00fcr mich nahm das irgendwie etwas von der Freude und dem Komfort, das Spiel in seiner vollen Pracht zu erleben, ohne immer an weitere K\u00e4ufe und Erweiterungen denken zu m\u00fcssen.\nFazit \u2013 Ein solides Spiel, aber nicht mein Fall\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Online hat zweifellos eine gro\u00dfe und treue Community, und f\u00fcr viele bietet es eine fantastische M\u00f6glichkeit, die Welt von Tamriel in einer neuen Art und Weise zu erleben. Die Freiheit in der Charaktergestaltung, die umfangreiche Welt und die M\u00f6glichkeit, das Spiel mit anderen zu teilen, sind die St\u00e4rken, die ESO zu einem beliebten Titel machen. Doch f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich war es einfach nicht das gleiche Gef\u00fchl wie bei den klassischen Elder Scrolls-Spielen. Das Spiel bietet viele beeindruckende Features, aber ich kann nicht leugnen, dass ich eher der Einzelspieler-Typ bin, der sich in die tiefen, offenen Welten von Skyrim und Oblivion st\u00fcrzt.\n\nFazit: Wenn du ein gro\u00dfer Fan von Skyrim bist und dir schon immer gew\u00fcnscht hast, diese Erfahrung im Mehrspieler-Modus zu erleben, k\u00f6nnte The Elder Scrolls Online genau das Richtige f\u00fcr dich sein. Wenn du jedoch, wie ich, die isolierte und erz\u00e4hlerische Tiefe eines Einzelspielerspiels bevorzugst, wirst du dich hier m\u00f6glicherweise nicht ganz zu Hause f\u00fchlen. Trotz allem bleibt es ein gut gemachtes und beeindruckendes Online-RPG, das seinen Platz im Genre verdient.", "timestamp_created": 1736428896, "timestamp_updated": 1736537622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185176389": {"recommendationid": "185176389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062735050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 101, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1736627583}, "language": "english", "review": "disconnect at every 5 mins ,fuck this game", "timestamp_created": 1736423117, "timestamp_updated": 1736423117, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500509679317474365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185175322": {"recommendationid": "185175322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029142854", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 300729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2734, "playtime_at_review": 298553, "last_played": 1737382527}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr mich ist TESO, auch wenn es kleinere Schw\u00e4chen hat, ein sehr gutes MMO.

I'm trying it just to see if it'll fix an issue I'm having with detecting it in the Nvidia App, since there's currently a reward for running it for 50 mins through Nvidia.\r\n\r\nNo Steam Achievements, I consider a plus, as the plethora of ingame achievements can be grindier than I prefer for Steam.\r\n\r\nNo reall \"pay-to-win\": their ingame purchases are almost all about cosmetics, though there's also a fair bit of \"pay-for-convenience\". Like, buying the monthly \"ESO+\" subscription gives you much more storage space, etc, to the point that most longtime players swear by it as it just makes the game way more convenient. Similarly, you can buy pets who act as shopkeepers, bankers, etc. so you don't have to lug your loot back to a town. If you've already achieved something grindy on one character, you can usually pay to unlock it on another character to avoid doing the grind again; I've never bothered, but nice that the option's there. Most cool stuff (mounts, housing, etc) can be obtained for free; you can just get more of them with money.\r\n\r\nDifferent areas of the game have different modes: single-player, or play casually with friends (\"overland PvE\" - what I'll talk about most here), group co-op (\"Group PvE\": Trials, Group Dungeons), and player-vs-player (\"PvP\").\r\n\r\nLike myself, I'd say most players come from the single-player Elder Scrolls fanbase, rather than from other MMO fanbases, so we want single-player or casual small-group co-op content. Most agree that PvP just isn't the game's main strength. PvP has three forms: open-world battles based around besieging keeps across Cyrodiil (I rarely see more than a couple dozen people in a siege, though); similar fighting but in the Imperial city, where it's more about capture-the-flag; and 4v4 \"battlegrounds\". It's OK if that's what you're into.\r\n\r\nSome areas require or at least encourage co-op. At the moment, even the areas which encourage co-op (\"Group Dungeons\") can mostly be solo'd unless you go for the harder \"veteran\" difficulty, though a few dungeons have \"mechanics\" that require two or more people. Trials are 12-person things where you go up against heftier NPC opponents (\"mobs\"). Trials and Dungeons are non-casual, in that it's kinda a jerk move to drop out in the middle of running one.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of the world, however, is \"overland\". Despite its name, this includes a lot of the underground smaller delves. You can do this in a group or alone, but really, solo play is *better* unless you commit to doing quests together, otherwise you fall out of synch, where one person has a quest to run off and complete, while someone else has already done it. Like, my wife and I have characters reserved just for playing together. Fro the most part they've made it so that you at least CAN group together, though, regardless of whether you've done the quest in that area or not.\r\n\r\nBut casual PvE is where the game shines.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly what all the devs enjoy, and clearly what most players do, too. There is *months* of story-based quest content, that mostly isn't just oldschool-MMO \"kill 10 rats and come back\" but more like \"find out who's behind nefarious goings-on by searching for clues, talking to people, fighting, exploring, interacting with the world, etc\". Not saying there aren't any grindy quests: just that they aren't the norm.\r\n\r\nThe main questline of the area is story-based, and there're a significant number of story-based side-quests in each zone too. Just about every delve has one, plus there are many others throughout the world, as both fixed and random encounters.\r\n\r\nThen each zone has about three repeatable \"daily\" quests (meaning you can't usually pick up the quest more than once a day, not that you have to do 'em all every day: there's well over a hundred!). These are usually one simple \"kill <random boss>\", one \"do some repeating world event\", and one \"complete a delve\", but can also include things like \"win a card game\" or \"sneak through this area and assassinate a target\" or \"steal an item in this building\" or... you get the idea.\r\n\r\nAs well as the solo questing, there's also lots of other things to do: the \"tales of Tribute\" card game I already mentioned; legerdemain has you picking pockets and stealing from houses; crafting is a whole specialty you can sink years into mastering; fishing (collect 9 rare fish from each zone for an achievement); housing (you can buy and craft furniture, invite people to it, and make things convenient by putting all sorts of utilities like bankers, merchants, crafting tables, training dummies, mundus stones, etc all close together; you can tour other people's works and see some truly amazing stuff they've made (my favorite was a Borg Cube); arenas (where you go through several rounds of monsters, in interesting environments that make it harder but more interesting); the \"infinite archive\" (like an arena, but an unlimited number of rounds); antiquities (where you solve a couple of simple puzzle minigames to find and dig up interesting things); and more I'm forgetting.\r\n\r\nThe game is designed to support being played intermittently; you pick it up when there's an event, or a new release, and then you drop it for a while, and come back when there's something else cool going on. But at the same time, it's also designed to make you WANT to keep playing, to complete that outfit, to finish decorating that house, etc.\r\n\r\nOverall: I've been playing for over ten years, and there's still so much I haven't yet done in the game. And I likely never will, because they expand it at least as fast as I can consume the content.", "timestamp_created": 1736262424, "timestamp_updated": 1736262424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744976222515106201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185021702": {"recommendationid": "185021702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399248441", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5916, "last_played": 1679078681}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyunu 10 saat falan oynad\u0131m launcherdan indirme yapmas\u0131 88 saat s\u00fcrd\u00fc", "timestamp_created": 1736259737, "timestamp_updated": 1736259737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185016687": {"recommendationid": "185016687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060592901", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "playtime_at_review": 2049, "last_played": 1737196607}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435, \u0442\u0443\u0434\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0434\u044b\u043c, \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e :)", "timestamp_created": 1736255098, "timestamp_updated": 1736255098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185015415": {"recommendationid": "185015415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194248858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1736253608}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Why did I buy this stupid game?

all previous chapters on winter sale some two weeks ago, hoping to give this game a try one more time. I had the base game already, tried it 5-6 years ago bit I did not pick it up. Now, I got a friend who is willing to play it with me, since he moved to another continent, and the DLC was on a significant discount, but this is just not possible. I was really hoping that this would be our quality time since we played together a lot when he was in town, but it's just sad that I can't start this game.\n\nAfter the lengthy installation, trying to start the game was impossible. Every time I tried to do that I got the message \"Unable to initialize connection to steam\". \n\nNow, I did try to troubleshoot the problem via official ESO website about this problem which suggest getting steam offline/online etc, but it did not help. I have tried to log in into my ESO account associated with my email, tried to change my password and recover my user id, but whatever I do, the email from their side never comes. I have even troubleshooted email permissions on my side thinking that was the problem, but it is not. I was hoping, by accessing that account, that I would establish the connection with Steam and solve the issue. Bit it was in vain. I have also reinstalled and installed the game three times (once in other folder), which also did not bring any success. \n\nIt is was really frustrating going through all of that without any result. And I thought ESO is the one game I could play with my friend since there are so few games that could work with both of us, that are online and have some kind of progression. \n\nI wanted to do a refund, but I stopped to give it a one last try with you guys here. If anyone has some advice, please feel free to reply with the possible solution.

are incredibly hostile to anyone who doesn't just open their wallets every time the crown store refreshes. They also lied to its playerbase about the fixes.

can be frustrating due to obstacles like rocks and steep hills forcing you to take pointless detours.\r\n-Ability pathing can be confusing; an undo option for morphed abilities would be helpful.\r\n-Can definitely feel overwhelming at times.\r\n\r\nThe format of this MMO is both entertaining and liberating, offering numerous quality-of-life features. The early game is enjoyable, and the end game remains engaging. Overall, I\u2019d rate it an 9/10 for MMOs (Keep in mind I don't usually like MMOs) and a 7/10 overall. It\u2019s especially fun with friends, and the game boasts an active and engaging community.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend getting the game on sale, though the full price isn\u2019t a bad deal if

However, if you're into veteran dungeons/raids, you'll find out that the Devs (Zenimax) are EXTREMELY incompetent and unprofessional. They don't actually dedicate time to fixing bugs. They say they will, but then we have bugs that have been around for over FIVE YEARS. On top of that, they don't play their own game and from the very little they have shown on streams, they don't even have people within the company who are able to play and properly test veteran raiding.\nForums? Good luck with that. Any criticism is viewed as an attack, and answered either with a ban or with generic statements that don't actually mean anything.\n\nHere's a few examples of bugs: \n- You and a friend queue for a dungeon together as dps and tank. If the dps queues, you get in almost immediately. If the tank queues, the queue can bug and you'll get an endless wait, unless you keep regrouping and relogging. But then, when you try to regroup, you get sometimes a message that you are already in a group, even if you aren't.\n- join a raid group, port into the trial and the game kicks you from group immediately. In a loop. Doesn't matter how many times you try again.\n- You are in the middle of a raid and the servers disconnect you (which btw happens often). If you try to log back in immediately, which is normal to try to do, you get A LOGIN ERROR AND CANT LOG IN FOR FIVE MINUTES.\n- They don't have enough servers and they are poorly maintained, so each time an Event happens, raid instances are laggy and people get disconnected often. To make matters worse, they recently changed the game so when someone disconnects in raid, you lose vitality. So, if your raid is trying to get an achievement without deaths and someone disconnects, even if they dc alive, you'll lose vitality and will have to restart a 20 minute run.\n- There are serious heal/buff bugs, where certain skills don't target the players who need it. Like the same buff will refresh on the same players when you recast, instead of targeting first the players who dont have the buff yet. Some heals target people who are full health instead of low health.\n\nThe list goes on and on and these problems have been around for LITERAL YEARS and they either don't care, or don't have people competent enough to fix issues.

If they add the option to buy into that program with earnable in-game gold, then this will be a major major go(winner).", "timestamp_created": 1735808944, "timestamp_updated": 1735808944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184513256": {"recommendationid": "184513256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054447599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1867, "last_played": 1735805039}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has too many bugs", "timestamp_created": 1735808266, "timestamp_updated": 1735808266, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500509679317474365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184506521": {"recommendationid": "184506521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079432160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 7323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "playtime_at_review": 4802, "last_played": 1736435994}, "language": "english", "review": "If your willing to Role play it, the story and side quests are amazing along with the combat. you lowkey need to get the sub for it to be far more enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1735800314, "timestamp_updated": 1735800314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184504215": {"recommendationid": "184504215", "author": {"steamid": "76561199134760388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 10586, "last_played": 1737256737}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game, but easy to max up.

This game a whole bunch of systems that take a very long time to max out. For example, the Scrying and Excavating tree that you get from the antiquity quest-line takes ages to upgrade just to unlock the ability to scry high tier gear. Also, this is only available for that one character you did it on, and not account wide. Which is BS. To become a crafter takes a long time too, you have to level up your tree by doing daily writs (for ages), and getting the traits off of other gear for your collection, which has a cooldown. Basically if you aren't invested for the long haul you'll have to ask other people to craft you items and even miss out on high-tier loot, just because they have these horrible systems. Everything else is fun. The story is great, the amount of quality quests is good, and the ability to utilize mods is great! One thing I would recommend though, is to get the subscription just because it makes your life a lot easier and cheaper, since the DLCs are expensive to buy just themselves. Also, you get a crafting bag which makes the game playable for the most part; why I say this, is due to the fact that you have no bank or inventory space. You'll have to create mules just to hold your loot and materials if you don't have the subscription. An added bonus is recieving 1650 crowns to spend in the crown store.\n\nSide-note: don't spend your crowns on the crates thinking you'll get something good, because you won't. The chances of getting a good item is slim. You'll just get consumables which are worse than the things you can craft and some subpar cosmetic that doesn't look that good.

Bethesda y ZeniMax han logrado crear no solo un videojuego, sino una experiencia que redefine lo que significa estar dentro de un universo vivo.\r\n\r\n1. Un Mundo que Respira Magia e Historia\r\nTamriel nunca ha sido tan vibrante como lo es en ESO. Desde las dunas abrasadoras de Elsweyr hasta los majestuosos picos nevados de Skyrim, cada regi\u00f3n es un cuadro viviente que late con la promesa de aventuras \u00fanicas. Cada rinc\u00f3n tiene un secreto que contar, cada cueva una leyenda que explorar, y cada personaje una historia que escuchar. La diversidad de biomas y culturas es tan vasta que da la sensaci\u00f3n de que Tamriel nunca dejar\u00e1 de sorprenderte.\r\n\r\n2. Una Historia Personalizada para Ti\r\nLa narrativa de ESO no solo respeta el lore cl\u00e1sico de la franquicia Elder Scrolls; lo eleva. Cada misi\u00f3n est\u00e1 escrita con un nivel de detalle impresionante, ofreciendo giros inesperados y momentos emotivos. A diferencia de otros MMORPG, aqu\u00ed eres m\u00e1s que un jugador; eres el h\u00e9roe de una epopeya que evoluciona seg\u00fan tus decisiones.\r\n\r\n3. Una Comunidad Vibrante y Acogedora\r\nDesde el momento en que pones un pie en Tamriel, la comunidad de ESO te recibe con los brazos abiertos. Tanto si eres un jugador experimentado como un principiante, encontrar\u00e1s gremios dispuestos a ayudarte, eventos comunitarios que unen a jugadores de todo el mundo y una atm\u00f3sfera colaborativa que rara vez se encuentra en otros t\u00edtulos multijugador.\r\n\r\n4. Jugabilidad que Abarca Todo Tipo de Estilo\r\n\u00bfEres un guerrero incansable que busca el combate m\u00e1s desafiante? \u00bfO quiz\u00e1s un artesano que disfruta creando las armas y armaduras m\u00e1s codiciadas? ESO ofrece algo para todos. Con un sistema de combate din\u00e1mico y una personalizaci\u00f3n de habilidades que permite combinar clases, armas y magia, la creatividad es la clave para destacar en el campo de batalla.\r\n\r\n5. Una Cascada Constante de Actualizaciones\r\nZeniMax nunca deja de sorprendernos con contenido fresco. Cada expansi\u00f3n y DLC es una obra de arte que a\u00f1ade nuevas \u00e1reas, historias y mec\u00e1nicas de juego. Adem\u00e1s, los eventos de temporada y festivales aseguran que siempre haya algo emocionante en el horizonte.\r\n\r\n6. Gr\u00e1ficos y M\u00fasica que Tocan el Alma\r\nLa est\u00e9tica de ESO es simplemente impresionante. Cada paisaje est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado con esmero, mientras que la m\u00fasica, con sus composiciones orquestales \u00e9picas, no solo acompa\u00f1a al jugador, sino que lo transporta emocionalmente. El tema principal, en particular, es un himno que captura la esencia misma de la aventura.\r\n\r\n\u00bfPor Qu\u00e9 No Puedo Dejar de Jugar ESO?\r\nPorque ESO no es solo un juego; es un viaje. Es la posibilidad de convertirte en el h\u00e9roe de tu propia historia, de unir fuerzas con jugadores de todo el mundo y de ser testigo de c\u00f3mo un universo sigue creciendo y evolucionando con el tiempo.\r\n\r\nSi est\u00e1s buscando una experiencia que trascienda el g\u00e9nero MMORPG y ofrezca un nivel de inmersi\u00f3n que pocos juegos logran alcanzar, The Elder Scrolls Online es una elecci\u00f3n obligatoria.\r\n\r\nCalificaci\u00f3n final: 10/10.\r\nTamriel te espera, y cr\u00e9eme, no te arrepentir\u00e1s de responder a su llamado.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735689514, "timestamp_updated": 1735689514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184373292": {"recommendationid": "184373292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321819879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3448, "playtime_at_review": 12331, "last_played": 1737412870}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is one of my favs and has so much to the game your can never get tired of it", "timestamp_created": 1735684706, "timestamp_updated": 1735684706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513618707656860352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184372390": {"recommendationid": "184372390", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034807211", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1735688599}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735683922, "timestamp_updated": 1735683922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184371206": {"recommendationid": "184371206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834409049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5867, "playtime_at_review": 12524, "last_played": 1737371421}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Skyrim, but it's online.

It's extremely common to have 999 ping in this game when your internet is otherwise great, and when this high ping situation happens, it's usually accompanied with getting forcefully logged out and being unable to log back in until they have whatever server issues under control that are causing the lost connections. It can get extremely bad to the point where it truly is unplayable, and that really really stings if you're paying 20+ bucks a month for an \"ESO Plus\" subscription.\n\nThe balancing in each update is almost always terrible. What ends up generally happening is the staff cater so much to balancing for the PvP element of the game to appease the 25% of players that do PvP, but these changes throw the 75% who play PvE, under the bus. A class like Warden, which is generally mediocre or on the weak side in PvE, will get nerfed further because of 1 tiny weird strat that gives it a slight advantage in a niche PvP case. Another issue about balancing that I can't particularly prove, but I know is the case just from experience, is that they purposely make their newest paid content greatly OP to entice more sales, and then nerf that new content once it's free with ESO+. So it ends up as a situation where \"balancing\" isn't really about \"balancing\" but more about making sure the newest content is juicy enough to pay extra for. I can't particularly prove this, but check my hours and please take my word for it.\n\nAnother bad thing about this game is that it's very poorly moderated. When a user makes a report about another user, or the not-so-accurate cheat detection system thinks you're speedhacking because you're wearing the fastest gear in the game (true story), you will be guilty until proven innocent. Their policy for handling accusations is to ban the accused for 72 hours immediately without any form of proof. The accused then has to jump through hoops to appeal the ban, which results in a back-and-forth with an automated response system approximately 4-5 times until it is finally sent to a human for review. By that time, your ban is over, but you still have to jump through the hoops so that you don't keep the erroneous strike on your account, since you will be perma banned after 3-4 strikes. \n\nThe game itself is not bad at all when the servers aren't choking to death, but the extra nonsense that comes with it is definitely not worth it, especially for an MMO. It really sucks when you've invested SO much time into a game and the game ends up going downhill so bad managerially that you end up feeling like you lost a good chunk of your life to something that all of a sudden after many good years, suddenly crashed and burned.\n\nThey also manage their forums in a very sketchy way, shutting down almost all threads that criticize things in the game, and overall extremely aggressive forum moderation to the point where there's not much you're allowed to say about the game other than good things. They have a \"if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all\" kind of policy on their forums, which can be good, unless you think that any form of critique is not nice and answer back with a banhammer.\n\nLast thing to note, the scam/scambot scene is rampant in the game. Every 5 minutes your zone chat will have a new message from someone trying to \"sell\" in game stuff using stolen credit cards. You then get banned if you fall for their scam because your account is then tied to a purchase from a verified stolen CC. Most people with sense can smell these scams from a mile away, but it doesn't take away the fact that every 5 damn minutes you'll be reading this junk in the zone chat, and the only way to stop seeing this scam spam is to turn off the entire zone chat and become antisocial. This problem is made 10 times worse by the fact that the devs keep taking measures to fight back against the scammers in a way that ruins it for all the honest folk. For example, because the scammers were scamming too much, they removed gifting from the game entirely. So the 99% of honest folk got their gifting privileges removed because of the 1% of players that are scammers. After a while they sort of added gifting back into the game but you need to go through some giant application process by raising a support ticket and they either accept or deny you based on unknown criteria. I got denied for my application to gift again, and I still don't know why. I actually got denied 3 times because I tried to reapply twice.\n\nTrust me you don't want to get involved with this game, it will be lost time, and we humans don't live that long. If you want an MMO my recommendation is FF14. It's managed much better and the community is a million times nicer. They're a bit of a furry lot, but you can look past that when they're so damn helpful and positive", "timestamp_created": 1735636838, "timestamp_updated": 1735638095, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591379106044769287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184310491": {"recommendationid": "184310491", "author": {"steamid": "76561199799746620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1736077611}, "language": "german", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1735636253, "timestamp_updated": 1735636253, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184302784": {"recommendationid": "184302784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217600173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 40144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3723, "playtime_at_review": 31053, "last_played": 1737358888}, "language": "english", "review": "SUPER COOL", "timestamp_created": 1735630702, "timestamp_updated": 1735630702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184300048": {"recommendationid": "184300048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367189087", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "playtime_at_review": 1421, "last_played": 1736930316}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who loves MMORPGs, I can confidently say that ESO has given me one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.\n\n\"The world is breathtakingly immersive, from the detailed landscapes to the dynamic NPCs.\"\n\"The questlines are so engaging; I genuinely felt like a hero in Tamriel.\"\n\"The combat system strikes a perfect balance between strategy and action\u2014it\u2019s incredibly satisfying.\"\n\nIn just 20 hours, I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what ESO has to offer, but every moment has been pure fun.", "timestamp_created": 1735629102, "timestamp_updated": 1735629102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513618707656860352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184299450": {"recommendationid": "184299450", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990094367", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6697, "last_played": 1735057121}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, I really wanted to love ESO.

Plus on utilise un type de comp\u00e9tence, plus celle-ci augmente et nous propose de choix. C'est bien fichu parce que pour d\u00e9bloquer tout, il faut jouer de tout. Ca passe autant par les comp\u00e9tences de classe, que les guildes ou les armes utilis\u00e9es.\nComp\u00e9tences que l'on peut choisir ou am\u00e9liorer gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des points de comp\u00e9tences que l'on obtient soit en augmentant de niveau (jusqu'au lvl 50), soit en r\u00e9cup\u00e9rant des cristaux (shards), soit en faisant certaines qu\u00eates ou activit\u00e9s.\n\n- Puis un syst\u00e8me qui ressemble pas mal au Parangon de Diablo III, pour ceux \u00e0 qui \u00e7a parle, ou l'on peut monter jusqu'au niveau 3000+, qui apporte un arbre de comp\u00e9tence plut\u00f4t fourni.\n\n\nL'\u00e9volution dans le monde, elle, est assez similaire \u00e0 ce que l'on connait, on navigue sur la map soit \u00e0 pied, soit en monture (terrestre). Le bon point c'est que d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but on poss\u00e8de des points de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation dans toutes les r\u00e9gions, ce qui nous permet d'aller ou l'on veut quand on veut. Les mobs s'adaptent \u00e0 notre niveau (jusqu'au niveau de champion 160, ou le \"vrai jeu commence\"), rajoutant encore une couche sur le fait que l'on peut aller XP ou l'on souhaite. \n\nIl y a plusieurs types \"d'instances\", les Antres, qui sont des donjons relativement petits, avec un boss, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une qu\u00eate, et une shard. Les Donjons publics, un peu plus complets avec plusieurs boss, des qu\u00eates, etc. Si pour les deux premiers il est possible de croiser des joueurs, pour les derniers, les Donjons priv\u00e9s, vous ne croiserez personne, et il sera n\u00e9cessaire d'y aller en groupe (ou en solo, avec mon Templier j'en ai solo un, donc c'est long mais \"faisable\")\n\n\u00c9videmment il existe une pl\u00e9thore de qu\u00eates, principales (de zone ou g\u00e9n\u00e9rales), secondaires, r\u00e9p\u00e9tables.\n\n\nAussi, le syst\u00e8me d'artisanat, il est tr\u00e8s li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution de notre personnage, en effet ces comp\u00e9tences se d\u00e9bloquent de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les comp\u00e9tences d'armes ou de classe. Plus vous faites d'artisanat, par exemple de Forge, plus vous gagnez de l'exp\u00e9rience dans cette pratique et plus vous pouvez d\u00e9penser vos points de comp\u00e9tences dedans. \nIl existe un nombre assez impressionnant de composants, li\u00e9s soit \u00e0 votre niveau de personnage, soit ensuite \u00e0 votre niveau de champion. \n\nPour finir, en ce qui concerne l'abonnement ESO+, il n'est pas essentiel, oui il ajoute de la \"Quality of Life\" avec l'inventaire d'artisanat, mais si vous jouez pour le plaisir sans chercher \u00e0 looter tous les composants d'artisanats ce que vous voyez, il y a moyen de s'en passer. D'ailleurs la seule \"vraie\" raison de le prendre c'est clairement pour cet inventaire d'artisanat \"infini\", sans quoi ce qu'il apporte est franchement n\u00e9gligeable. Chacun y verra midi \u00e0 sa porte, mais il me semble important de rappeler qu'un MMORPG co\u00fbte tr\u00e8s cher \u00e0 entretenir, et qu'il me semble normal que pour un g\u00e9ant comme TESO, cela soit propos\u00e9 (et non \"impos\u00e9\" ...).\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nVerdict, c'est un bonheur \u00e0 jouer, tr\u00e8s grosse vibe Skyrim, sans \u00eatre exactement la m\u00eame chose. \u00c9norm\u00e9ment de contenu, dont la plupart peut \u00eatre fait en solo ce qui est un point appr\u00e9ciable, m\u00eame dans un MMO. \nBeaucoup de zones \u00e0 explorer, toujours un plaisir de retrouver les ambiances des zones comme dans les autres Elder Scrolls, m\u00eame si les zones ne sont pas fid\u00e8les \u00e0 100%, l'ambiance y est.\nLe gameplay est vif, le fait d'\u00eatre en TPS avec un viseur me rappelle TERA, c'est bien fait. J'ai vite fait test\u00e9 le PvP \u00e0 l'\u00e9criture de ces lignes et c'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t fun, tr\u00e8s nerveux, quant \u00e0 savoir pour l'\u00e9quilibrage c'est un autre d\u00e9bat dans lequel je ne m'aventurerai pas, puisque je n'ai pas assez jou\u00e9. \nJ'ai pas vu de bugs majeurs durant mes 70 premi\u00e8res heures de jeu, vite fait un PNJ qui n'apparaissait pas dans une instance, je suis sortie et revenu et il \u00e9tait l\u00e0.\nC'est un MMO sur lequel j'aime aller pour \u00eatre tranquille, exprimer ma \"compl\u00e9tionnite aig\u00fce\", monter mes comp\u00e9tences de personnage, d\u2019artisanat et profiter de l'ambiance en papillonnant pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des mat\u00e9riaux et autres collectibles.\n\n\ntl;dr: MMORPG reprennant l'ambiance de Skyrim sans \u00eatre Skyrim, grosse map \u00e0 parcourir, presque tout est faisable avec un seul personnage. Possibilit\u00e9 de solo \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de contenu, rendant le jeu tr\u00e8s chill. Gameplay assez nerveux et propre.

mobs and complete quest to level up, but I am not keen on the chapter / dlc model.\n\nIf you buy the base game, you get the base game and the Morrowind chapter to keep for life, yes.\n\nBut the way the purchase model is set up is that you can buy Gold Road and get a bunch of extra chapters and zones to play in, but surprisingly, there is very little dlc that can be bought directly on steam. Why? Because ESO has an in-game purchase model where you spend real money to buy the in-game crown currency, and then you use those crowns to buy dlc, which ranges from cosmetics to extra zones and areas that aren't a part of the Gold Road bundle, such as Murkmire. The only way to get these things is to use the crowns, instead of buying them directly as steam dlc.\n\nSo you can buy the base game, you can buy the big Gold Road bundle, but the devs still want you to spend extra money on top of extra money for chapters and dlc packs just to play the in-game content, or buy the monthly subscription...\n\nIt's disappointing that developers would do this, and that long-time mmo players encourage this with their purchases and subscriptions...", "timestamp_created": 1735401373, "timestamp_updated": 1735401373, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513618707656860352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183997523": {"recommendationid": "183997523", "author": {"steamid": "76561199754732581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4313, "playtime_at_review": 26958, "last_played": 1736183560}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u7684\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765 5000+\u5c0f\u65f6", "timestamp_created": 1735399414, "timestamp_updated": 1735399414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489795923233032227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183997283": {"recommendationid": "183997283", "author": {"steamid": "76561199542755912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 195, "playtime_at_review": 804, "last_played": 1735319233}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1735399249, "timestamp_updated": 1735399249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183990322": {"recommendationid": "183990322", "author": {"steamid": "76561199572737279", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 250, "playtime_at_review": 4676, "last_played": 1735322778}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El launcher es una poronga y es insultante tener que descargar los 120gb que pesa el juego una segunda vez desde ese launcher maldito que tiene problemas con la velocidad del internet", "timestamp_created": 1735394610, "timestamp_updated": 1735394610, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577194094657897949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183987412": {"recommendationid": "183987412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198956973025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 799, "playtime_at_review": 1979, "last_played": 1735655407}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6545\u4e8b\u5167\u5bb9\u4e0d\u932f , \u6253\u64ca\u611f\u9084\u597d , \u5730\u5716\u5927\u4efb\u52d9\u591a , \u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u7684\u904a\u6232", "timestamp_created": 1735392486, "timestamp_updated": 1735392486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183975920": {"recommendationid": "183975920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074049050", "num_games_owned": 2817, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 15051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15051, "last_played": 1734257663}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun MMORPG, but you need to buy DLC if you continue to progress.", "timestamp_created": 1735384430, "timestamp_updated": 1735384430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183970890": {"recommendationid": "183970890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154572841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 557, "playtime_at_review": 8914, "last_played": 1735584931}, "language": "english", "review": "Today marks a sad day for my Skyrim/Eso/Bethesda gaming. Today iv finally decided to call it after 300 hours of eso across xbox and pc and around 1000 hours on skyrim iv throwen the towel in. Not only is the community highly toxic the staff are equally as bad. Iv never had warnings on any game ever in 25 years ! This game just gets you to spend your money and give nothing in return that shouldn't be pay to pay eg a recourses bag. On xbox day one first year you could buy mounts with crowns not anymore. You could actually find helpful guilds willing to help new players...not anymore. The language Barrier is disgraceful and disgusting..if your going to advertise a game world wide and only supply 2 servers your going to get a mixture of people from around the world. This morning I posted to find any new guilds. in my post I put no toxic guilds/No drama otherwise u can suck on my hotdog.. reported and warning given ? Ah hotdog your telling me americans are getting offended by hotdog? Such a joke and childish act I wouldn't pay another cent to this creator and to show them I could care less I have deleted 300 hours worth of gameplay and uninstalled the game. On to throne of liberty ! Highly recommended to anyone looking for another mmo rpg\n\n\nOne last thing the game has gone down 4x in 4 weeks since buying it on pc. It will be free soon because everyone is abandoning it as u can tell by the player stat's per day is drastically declining.

But for Solo gaming and PVE play only, I can recommend this game at the current sale price with 67% discount for the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2662630/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online_Gold_Road/]The Elder Scrolls Online Deluxe Collection: Gold Road[/url].  The bundle includes all past 8 DLCs with some Deluxe items. The world is so huge so if you like exploration, this game is for you. There are varied Biomes with different creatures roaming around in their territories. Traveling is also easy when you learn how to use the Shrines and the Map. As the player discovers new locations and Shrines, the world slowly becomes more accessible. The combat system is great and player movement is quite fluid. I felt the difference every time I upgrade/downgrade my Character stats and gear. There are many game mechanics/systems aside from just fighting, item crafting, and housing.  There is also some sort of an archaeology system, spellcrafting, PVP, special events, and more.\n\nGame's visual quality is still quite decent for this day and age... when I used the \"DLAA\" option in my Graphics Card. The audio quality is top-notch. The background music, the special effects timing and crispiness + loudness of them are right on and have contributed greatly to the feel of combat and when exploring the vast world.\n\nWhat I don't like though is the [b]overpriced Crowns and the pricing of items in it's Store[/b]. They are just too expensive and unreachable for most folks. I suggest emulating the [b]Steam store[/b] and change their pricing model on these [b]Crown goods[/b] based on the regional location of the customer. Make it affordable to folks who like to buy sachets of shampoo's instead of a bottle, reloading of prepaid cellphone data instead of subscribing to a postpaid plan,  and so on... else just bundle all those Crown products and offer them as separate DLCs that usually go on sale and can be purchased by cash. By the way, the in-game currency system is also confusing for newbies but it works. There are Gold, Crowns, Gems, Event Tickets, Seals of Endeavor, and Writs if I remember correctly. They are used in different ways. But mostly to acquire more items and/or upgrades.\n\nIf you're looking for an MMORPG that can also work for solo PVE gaming aside from social gaming, [b]The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road Deluxe Collection[/b] might be for you. For players who complain about the game being too easy as they are masochist gamers who love the [i]Souls-like genre[/i], you can skip this title as you won't probably like it.  :-P  Game difficulty for this one is standard and the gear the player uses and his character stats will determine how a fight will go. It's a great combat system which the player has total control over. I just wish the Servers will be more stable so we can log in and play anytime we want. \n\nLastly, please be informed that this [b]10 year old game[/b] has accumulated a huge file size and so downloading may take time before you can play especially if your Internet access is slow. Upon checking my Steam directory for this game, it uses nearly [b]140 GB[/b]. That's nearly three times the size of [b]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1735370887, "timestamp_updated": 1735372043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5342140793800354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183958958": {"recommendationid": "183958958", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078647965", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1735367639}, "language": "english", "review": "bro the game is about 220 gb !!!!!!!! \r\nwhen you download the 120 gb from steam and you lunch the game its say you need to download another 100 gb in the luncher !! \r\ngo f#u&k youre self i not ganna download 220 gb for this", "timestamp_created": 1735368635, "timestamp_updated": 1735368635, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517410635948181152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183940838": {"recommendationid": "183940838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274725848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 11177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11177, "last_played": 1636052033}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend only to complete the story and leave.

BUT how on earth the Devs of this game understand the basic thing of what makes MMORPG game enjoyable? simply, they don't.\n\nI built a sorcerer, loved it and made many builds with it. What the devs do? Lets push some updates to change how casting skills work and ruin the build under the so called \"Game balancing\". Dumped the char and didn't play it again.\n\nThen i built a nightblade, loved how the sneaky kills can get you a chance for a solo in this game and spent sometime enjoying it. But again, update 44, Devs ruined the nightblade and changed how its skill works. Dumped the char and left the game for good.\n\nConclusion: when balancing the game YOU DO NOT change the way skill works. YOU CHANGE damage attributes / skill cost until you reach a desired balancing game play. i sincerely got fed up of how those Devs keep changing core skills and how they cast and decided to quit the game.\n\nSo if you are reading this review and considering to buy or play, JUST DON'T.

TL:DR: Is it even worth it anymore?\nBeen around since launch. Migrated to Steam only 3 or 4 years ago. So, my hours are not only accumulated here on steam...\n\nThis was the last good installment of the TES series. (off topic-ish) I believe TES6 will be garbage, look at starfield lol. \n\n(back on topic)\nI was a parse monkey, progging and an example of listening to the raid lead and parsing and not standing in stupid. I was a decent tanky healer in Cryo. I had free housing from dailies and such but, I kinda decorated the only house I bought, the enchanted snow-globe. Been a faithful with ESO+ for years, because, craft bag. You do not really want to have to play this game without the craft bag, that is the real veteran content of the game (note sarcasm)\n\nI am done.... \nJust done. \nThis game is not good anymore. When the zone chat started posting \"selling carry runs\" I sighed. This means, end game content is done and boring and really nothing left to do except give people fake achievements so they could appear to be veteran. \nAll this game is now...\nMoney dump - scribing so you can actually compete in pvp, housing (good lord the housing) cosmetics (pretty standard) eso+ for the craft bag, crowns for gambling. \nPvP- lagging, disconnecting, mount running simulator... if you can mount due to being bugged and stuck in combat\nPvE - well, there is no pve, you just enter a delve and sprint to the boss and then nuke them and then sprint out....Trials is end game and vet is exclusive. So, better start hitting that parse dummy or no one will even listen to you. PvE is a gear grind and boring. \n\nThe servers are a mess, if there is a PvP event, your PvE content will be lagged out bad, or you will disco every 5 to 10 min. Meaning, if you are in a trial or something , you get kicked off the game and have to back out all the way, sometimes reboot, log back in... You're 11 man team will have melted the boss and moved on, you lose your loot. If they do not replace you an add fill. They will never actually fix these servers. PvP lags no matter what. If someone starts bragging about their ping and not being disco'd, they are an elitist and they are lying. \n\nThere is no difficulty curve until you get to veteran, and then it is literally just a matter of gear, upgraded, and not standing in stupid for the dps.. which is everyone anyways, and grouping for a tank. The healer.... lol healing.... is only needed in vet trails, PvP healingis  self heals only, a dedicated healer is almost never necessary except for zergs, and healing for vet dlc content, but, if you don't have ESO+ or dropped a crap ton of money into crowns to buy the dlc's individually, you are not playing that content anyways. \n\nI am one of the only players who miss the zone difficulty before One Tamerial, after that, it was really really really easy, for the most part, if you have a crafter, you can start soloing world bosses at lvl 20, even lower levels than that if you have a toon leveled to CP160 and above. If you are brand new, you wont be doing that. But, you will not be dying to a pair of wolves like you could in WoW or any other mmo's where you run through a zone crapping your pants because a mob is chasing you down, \n\nWish it had not morphed into this. But, it did, and now I am a sad sad panda. I loved this game, I love TES.
