You won't know if you're ready to try the next star level of expedition until you try it, and then you'll either do okay or get instantly flattened right out of the gate and lose your run because your numbers needed to be 80% higher.\r\n\r\nAlso, the game sorta requires the two paid dlc to have a decent spread of content and *any* meta-progression, and even then this isn't really a title with much meta-progression in it.\r\n\r\nThose two things out of the way, this is a gem. It's a weird gem, and if you don't instantly click with its board-game-y flow and TTRPG-y combat you'll have a bad time, but I think it's neat.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is that you live in a world where exploring is a cool thing to do and fortunately lots of other cultures exist to be explored. You don't *just* kill other people and take their stuff for the british museum, though. You can wheedle and neg people in order to take their stuff---sometimes during the same combat.\r\n\r\nThere's a strange flow to fights in this, where the three diplomacy types (peaceful, mean, sword) have a rocks paper scissors and you and your enemies each have a main type based on which you've used the most during the fight, which determines a passive effect on all stats. This in turn interacts with different characters having different skill levels in the different types of diplomacy, and your main type at the end of each fight determining that fight's outcome in the story. It's not hard to play, but it's surprisingly intricate in terms of how you have to build strategies around it to maximize your outcome.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there's a whole macroeconomics metagame in between expeditions where you leverage your resources for bonuses that let you leverage more resources. By all rights, this *should* make the game really clunky, but it isn't. A decent run is a couple hours long, and it feels breezy the whole time.\r\n\r\nI think if people have issues with this game, they'll be over how sharp the difficulty spikes are between star levels. I had monomaniacally built for combat, was in the endgame after clearing a four star expedition, went into a five star expedition, got into a two star combat (which should be insanely low at that point,) and instantly party wiped. However, I also don't think this is a barrier to enjoying the game.\r\n\r\nIf anything here sounds interesting to you, get this one + dlc on sale. At 60% off of higher I think it's a very safe purchase. If you already like complex board games, go for it at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1736549563, "timestamp_updated": 1736549563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185020184": {"recommendationid": "185020184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081628754", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1734113688}, "language": "english", "review": "A very creative and innovative game, though it starts to feel repetitive sooner than expected. \nEven so, i recommend it for any hidden gem hunter.", "timestamp_created": 1736258379, "timestamp_updated": 1736258379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184423109": {"recommendationid": "184423109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026175118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2472, "last_played": 1735856871}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect balance brain work and click and chill", "timestamp_created": 1735733431, "timestamp_updated": 1735733431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183887491": {"recommendationid": "183887491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106246974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "playtime_at_review": 204, "deck_playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1737398154}, "language": "english", "review": "Realized this game existed through reviewing the old reviews left by the late reviewer TotalBiscuit, and am glad I did as this game is a total banger that allows for massive amounts of replayability.
