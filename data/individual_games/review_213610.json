Decades old at this point, practically a classic. If you have any interest in Sonic at all and haven't already played this game, give it a go.\n\nThis game has some jank that modern games just don't have any more. You could get a game by with a lot of jank as long as the style is cool, as this game demonstrates. I think Sonic Adventure 1 is better, but 2 is still great and innovated a lot with 3D Sonic gameplay. Expect mech stages to get old, but Sonic/Shadow stages are fun. Knuckles stages are there.\n\nThis game innovated on the Chao Garden introduced in Sonic Adventure 1. Diehard fans will tell you that the Chao Garden was one of the main selling points of the game, and I would've argued otherwise but even after so damn long and on a mission to just beat the game 100% ASAP, I still put more hours into the Chao Garden than I expected to. It's stupid, and it's fun. If SEGA ever moved to make a standalone game around these things there would be some money to be had, but they never did.\n\nIf you made it to this game after seeing the 3rd Sonic movie, this is the origin of Shadow the Hedgehog. Enjoy his stereotypical edge.\n\nReconsider planning to go into this game dry. This game is vastly improved with mods using the SAModManager.

I never beat SA2 and forgot about it for 20 years so I reckon it's time to fix that. I also figure \"played it once and let nostalgia take over\" describes the average fan of SA2. It's a beautiful disaster of a game but still a bad one, only worthwhile because of a fair price tag and being an entertaining train wreck worth experiencing once. You could always read the (recent, good) comics, watch the movies or get the new Generations title if you're a Shadow fan, SA2 isn't likely to surprise you with some hidden facet of quality only true fans can appreciate.\n\nSA2 starts as most Sonic games do: Dr Eggman wants power to conquer the world. He invades a government base, discovers secret experiment Shadow and embarks upon a convoluted plot to power a planet-buster cannon in a space station. Sonic has to stop him and gets tagged as a criminal since everybody in the world is colorblind and thinks Shadow's crimes are his. There's two paths split between good guys and bad guys and of course I jumped at the chance to play Eggman first but don't worry, you can play them in either order and the plot will still be a mess. SA2 experimented with giving characters (some) backstory and motivation, for better or worse. A lot of the VAs kill it, sometimes, between bouts of translation errors, holes in dialogue and scene editing and the takes that are genuinely bad. It's hard to describe the amusement of a scene without quoting the entire script where 3 characters will yell lines at each other out of order with the wibbly-wobbly facial emoting or the hard camera cuts between stages that were meant to be played on the other side beforehand. Characters teleport into scenes at random, entire new scenes begin practically in the middle of other ones and so on. Even for appearing at the tail end of the time when cutscene quality in a game was a blind gamble SA2 is rough. It's not like SA1 had good cutscenes either yet that game still delivered a few sincere narratives with good conclusions. SA2 won't be doing much more than the occasional cutscene kino.\n\nWhat kills SA2 is that the gameplay stinks out loud. There's a split between character pairs, with Sonic/Shadow doing traditional 3D Sonic high speed dashes along scripted Hold Forward moments, slower janky \"shooter\" platforming as Tails/Eggman in robots and the much-dreaded scavenger hunt missions of Knuckles/Rogue in smaller, more detailed 3D arenas playing bad rounds of hot/cold. Sometimes you fight a mediocre copy-pasted boss, and I'm aggressively qualifying them against other games of the time including SA1. Nothing is going to be in Egg Viper tier, especially the anemic character vs character \"fights\" with extra weak AI. \n\nThe hub world of SA1 is gone, SA2 being all linear stages played in a set order. So if you hate a certain pair of character stages... too bad! Sometimes stages are extra irritating, like being on a timer and near the end of both paths you get extra bad gravity swapping sections to throw you off ledges more often. SA2 is mostly dominated by poor 3D platforming with floaty unreliable controls in smaller, more confined areas with a camera that hates to turn if there's a wall within a city block of it. Most of your attacks have obnoxiously sticky tracking that makes it easy to throw yourself into instant-kill pits(Sonic/Shadow), brainless tracking that is pretty dull as your homing gun auto-wins almost everything(Tails/Eggman) or no tracking with a bad camera and slippery movement(Knuckles/Rogue.) Plenty of bugs too, some attributed to the awful job done porting the game to PC. Some mods exist to help, though they can't fix all of the fundamental problems with the game, like enemy placement where most hits come from something spawning above you off screen and dropping immediately into your path, that kind of trashy design.\n\nI suppose SA2 looks decent for the era. The music is another manic/depressive episode with loads of classic Sonic butt rock, including fan favorites like Escape from the City, Pumpkin Hill, I Am The Eggman, Shadow's theme(and most of his stages.) There's also plenty of phoned-in low-energy generic tracks with poorly done sound mixing so you can spend an entire stage listening to the too-loud humming of hover dollies or stock alarm noises on infinite loop instead of the music. Still, I'll give this to SA2 as a plug, a lot of the nostalgic fan fervor comes from the ear worms delivered here.\n\nAt the end of the day and this review SA2 isn't too good. It might be your 7/10 hidden gem or childhood favorite and if so more power to you but it felt like a direct downgrade at release, is a bit of a series embarrassment that easily explains where Sonic 06 came from and only has barely enough weird energy going to justify a single lifetime playthrough if you don't just watch somebody else do it. It's hard to imagine running stages multiple times in a row to land better times and get all the emblems when you can swing your arm and hit 10 better platformers these days. A lot of the final stages involve throwing yourself at gravity or rail sections and praying they work before you run out of lives and don't even get the decency of using checkpoints. Your reward for sticking with SA2, a mediocre game, is to watch it blossom into a wretched one.\n\nBut hey, $10 for a funny bit of stupid gaming history.

I guess I'll begin with the fact that this is a part 2 to my original review posted for Sonic Adventure DX, in which at the end I said I looked forward to playing Sonic Adventure 2, to see how it has improved and or changed. Suffice to say, I wasn't pleased in the slightest.\r\n\r\nI'm not even gonna bother with the positives, cause I couldn't find many or any. I guess it's cool that this game is where Shadow and Rouge come from, some of my favorite characters from not just the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise but also media as a whole. But I'll be honest, had I not liked these characters from before playing Sonic Adventure 2, I would not have cared any more for them because of this game.\r\n\r\nI genuinely don't know what people see in this game to like it as much as they do. The physics are mostly the same as Sonic Adventure 1's, but every bit of fluidity of that game has been lost. The somersault being mapped to the same button as spin dashing, the spin dash having a delay and carrying more weight with it than being able to use it for funky shortcuts, the absolutely god awful detection with the rail grinding which 90% of the time sent me to my death, the overly large Treasure hunting stages not helped by the the new radar system which is completely inferior to what was already in Sonic Adventure DX.\r\n\r\nIronically, the stages which people dislike the most, being the Mech based stages, have the least of my problems with the game, though they still are too elongated and feel both heavy and slippery at the same time. I much preferred the way E-102 Gamma was done in Sonic Adventure DX. \r\n\r\nAnd that's another thing with this game that I don't understand, the fact that all of the stages and gameplay types have been put into one entire campaign mode split into two. If you didn't like a gameplay type or character from Sonic Adventure 1, you could simply choose not to play as them, or leave them to last or do it however you wanted. But with this game, you don't get to choose as you're forced to play as every gameplay type back to back, and it breaks the flow so much. Not to mention, people always say that only 1/3rd of the game is fun, if you ask me 0/3rd of the game is fun.\r\n\r\nThe cutscenes and dialogue manage to be even worse than Sonic Adventure DX in my opinion, despite having more direction and actual animation to them. Again, had I not known the plot about this game beforehand, I'd not understand a single thing about its story. I honestly don't know why this game is as well received as it is.\r\n\r\nAnother point would be people saying the game needs some mods for it to have the definitive experience, but I honestly fail to see how that's acceptable in any way. With Sonic Adventure DX, despite all the jank, I didn't feel the need to install any mods for the experience to be \"improved\", while it seems like with Sonic Adventure 2, unless you get the mods you're not gonna get to experience the game in any way that is close to being acceptable. \r\n\r\nWith Sonic Adventure DX, I went to the trouble of 100%'ing it and getting all the achievements because of how much I enjoyed it despite all its problems. With this game, I frankly didn't wanna even finish the main story, let alone 100% it.\r\n\r\nAll and all, I'll give this game is a 4/10. It's not the worst way to spend your money, and you might find it more enjoyable than I did. But I honestly failed to see how this game is as beloved as it is, as I found it to be one of the worst experiences of my entire gaming history. I do not recommend it myself, I'd more so recommend getting Sonic Adventure DX and modding the assets of Sonic Adventure 2 into that, and god knows there are tons of mods for that game that do just

If I hadn't waited so long to attempt booting the game, I would've refunded it when I had the chance. [b]Do not buy the game until the errors are fixed by the developers themselves.[/b]\n\n[u]For the developers:[/u]\nAttempting to boot the game brings me to a Settings popup. Regardless if I leave it alone or attempt to change settings, I get hit with the error [i]\"Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately. InvalidArgument=Value of '0' is not valid for 'index'. Parameter name: index.\"[/i]\n\nAttempting to Continue does nothing. Details and Quit are the only functioning options there. I can provide the full Details error if needed, seeing as the game consistently shows me the error with every attempt.\n\nI've tried closing out and reopening, uninstalling and reinstalling, installing to my internal harddrive and external harddrive. I'm a Windows 10 user and, based on the System Requirements being updated for beyond 2024, I should be able to play the game without a problem.

I had high expectations going in, because everyone says this is \"The best 3D Sonic game\" and it's the one that introduced Shadow, but unfortunately I just feel that too many aspects of this game were poorly executed. \r\n\r\nThe cutscenes don't do a good enough job at conveying the story, with massive jumps happening between each event, or important plot points feeling completely glossed over (The entire thing with Maria and Shadow for example, I don't know why she was important to him aside from the game just saying she is.) The cutscenes are also just really poor quality, with completely abysmal voice acting and direction, even for the time. I had a difficult time feeling invested in the story because of both of these issues, and any time I began to invest myself in the plot, there would be some laughably terrible line delivery or absurd cutscene timing.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the stages, I enjoyed the Sonic and Shadow stages the most, although I felt they were a little too linear a lot of the time, relying less on platforming and more on just holding forward and watching loops or rail grinds happen. Whenever I had proper control over Sonic or Shadow in the stronger platforming sections I had a lot more fun.\r\nUnfortunately, these stages only make up about one third of the overall game, with Tails/Eggman and Knuckles/Rouge stages taking up the other two, and they are a downward slope in both my enjoyment and their quality. I was regularly calling Knuckles stages \"The Knuckles Try Not to Kill Yourself Challenge\" due to how they always came up immediately after I started enjoying anything.\r\n\r\nI honestly have a hard time seeing what made this game so popular in the first place, with great music and a great intro stage being all I can really give it in terms of memorable moments, as well as a decent (final) ending. \r\n\r\nAll of that said, I did enjoy the game just enough to try out the first Sonic Adventure on Steam (with Dreamcast Conversion of course, don't worry) and I'm genuinely loving that game from start to finish. I'm sorry I wasn't able to love Sonic Adventure 2 the way I feel I was meant to, and maybe it was just a little too rich for me, but either way I'm glad I found something I love because of my mixed experience with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1737025507, "timestamp_updated": 1737025507, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493996590375900269", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185697761": {"recommendationid": "185697761", "author": {"steamid": "76561199673207351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 860, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1737386988}, "language": "english", "review": "would 100% play again!", "timestamp_created": 1737016493, "timestamp_updated": 1737016493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185696472": {"recommendationid": "185696472", "author": {"steamid": "76561199751919038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 249, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1737031896}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and cool", "timestamp_created": 1737014144, "timestamp_updated": 1737014144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185693075": {"recommendationid": "185693075", "author": {"steamid": "76561199143512112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 520, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1737342685}, "language": "english", "review": "sonic!!! the hedgehog!!!", "timestamp_created": 1737007813, "timestamp_updated": 1737007813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185693048": {"recommendationid": "185693048", "author": {"steamid": "76561199365451486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1737203114}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3055\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u6700\u9ad8\u5091\u4f5c\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u3042\u308b\u306a\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\r\n\u5727\u5012\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5965\u6df1\u3055\u3002\u795eBGM\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\r\n\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u8cb7\u3046\u306a\u3089\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u00d7\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3057\u307e\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1737007758, "timestamp_updated": 1737007758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185690548": {"recommendationid": "185690548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879246443", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1737096719}, "language": "english", "review": "shadow:3", "timestamp_created": 1737003345, "timestamp_updated": 1737003345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185686496": {"recommendationid": "185686496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170599937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 759, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1737263738}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't remember this game being as hard when i was an 8 year old with a gamecube. holy shit i raged a handful of times.

"english", "review": "Sonic Adventure 2 is not just a game; it's an experience that has etched itself in the hearts of countless gamers since its release in 2001. As a sequel to the iconic \"Sonic Adventure,\" this game successfully builds upon its predecessor, offering a rich blend of captivating gameplay, exceptional graphics, and an engaging storyline that can enthrall players for hours on end.\n\nFrom the moment you boot up the game, you are greeted with the dynamic and upbeat soundtrack that Sonic games are known for. The soundtrack of Sonic Adventure 2 is an incredible collection of tracks that perfectly encapsulates the essence of the franchise\u2014energetic, catchy, and downright exhilarating. Songs like \u201cLive and Learn,\u201d performed by Crush 40, are not just background music; they elevate the experience, making each level feel alive and packed with adrenaline.\n\nThe introduction of a dual storyline\u2014featuring both heroes and villains\u2014adds a layer of depth that sets it apart from its predecessor. Players get to experience the conflict between Sonic and his friends, including Tails and Knuckles, against the enigmatic Shadow the Hedgehog and his scientist ally, Dr. Eggman. This dual narrative intertwines beautifully, providing players with different perspectives and motivations, making the plot feel more intricate and engaging. Shadow, with his mysterious background and tragic story, became an instant favorite for many fans, offering a compelling contrast to the bright and cheerful Sonic.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Sonic Adventure 2 truly shines. The game introduces a diverse array of play styles, switching between fast-paced platforming as Sonic, treasure hunting as Knuckles, and mech-shooting segments as Tails. Each character has unique abilities that affect how you approach levels, keeping gameplay fresh and exciting. The high-speed sections as Sonic are exhilarating, pushing you to master the controls to reach that perfect run, while the treasure hunting segments with Knuckles present a satisfying puzzle aspect, asking players to think critically as they locate hidden emeralds. Even the shooting segments with Tails offer a fun diversion, showcasing diversity in gameplay that ensures there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nThe level design is simply brilliant. Each stage is packed with intricate details, shortcuts, and opportunities for exploration. Levels like \u201cCity Escape\u201d and \u201cGreen Forest\u201d are iconic, filled with loops, ramps, and various obstacles that perfectly capture Sonic's speed-driven nature. The thrill of racing down slopes, performing tricks, and bouncing off enemies is unmatchable. Not to mention, the vibrant environments, ranging from urban landscapes to mystical canyons, are beautifully rendered, showcasing the graphical capabilities of the Sega Dreamcast and later, other platforms.\n\nOne of the standout features of Sonic Adventure 2 is the Chao system. This mini-game allows players to raise and nurture adorable creatures known as Chao. The depth of this system goes beyond just raising them; you can train them, enter them in races, and even customize their appearance. This feature offers a delightful contrast to the high-octane gameplay and adds a layer of strategy and care. The emotional bond you form with your Chao, coupled with their evolution based on how you raise them, is a delightful distraction and a testimony to the game's design.\n\nMultiplayer mode is another highlight that enhances replay value. Whether racing against friends as your favorite character or competing in Chao Races, the multiplayer aspect encourages friendly competition and keeps the excitement alive well after you've finished the main campaign.

The plot of the second installment of the Adventure series follows two separate stories with 3 characters that mimic the other side, all of which play similarly to their counterpart. Sonic/Shadow levels are consistent as well as nice and fast. The controls can be a bit off at times, but it certainly isn't bad enough to make you quit the game. Once the ability to combat enemies is figured out, these levels tend to run much smoother. The only real issue within their levels is that the grinding mechanic tends to be weird at times. It brings in a little skill ceiling into the mix, however once it's learned, it becomes one of the most fun aspects of the game. Now the real issue in the game is the other characters. Knuckles/Rogue play as a treasure hunt level and the gliding ability helps with the openness of the levels, but it can get tedious as reaching areas with the strange wall climbing feature or the actual searching. Tails/Eggman show a big issue with the fact that their machines make them feel clunky and slow, which isn't the greatest thing in a Sonic game. It doesn't help that the shooting on enemies that aren't on same elevation feels incredibly annoying. Thankfully, their levels are overshadowed by the other characters levels.\r\n\r\nThe story of Sonic Adventure 2 debuts Shadow the Hedgehog as a story is being told from good and evil. Sonic and his friends fight to survive and put an end to Eggman's plans while Shadow starts to unravel his cunning plot, all to end up in a climatic ending to the Ark and Shadow's mysterious past. This game forms one of the most amazing and iconic stories the franchise has to offer.

God help me.\r\n\r\nBack in the 2000's I played Sonic Adventure 1 DX through on our family PC and I didn't have the means to play this right after. So now that I'm a grown ass man I decided to take it up and play it, since Shadow's been my favorite character since his original PS2 game and I do know the story of this one beforehand. \r\n\r\nIt might certainly be one of the most overhyped games ever post-release. Pinnacle of the franchise and such.\r\nIt does feature a lot of good stuff with storytelling, level design and music.\r\nBut gameplay really just keeps pushing me away more and more.\r\nIt's also a surprisingly challenging game, like Sonic and Shadow levels where you have to try and maximize speed and find faster routes within a level. Thing they have improved upon in later games. It's great, but still janky. So when it comes to Sonic and Shadow's own levels they are the best the game has to offer.\r\n\r\nI might be cynical, but I don't enjoy playing as the other characters at all.\r\n\r\nGame features iconic levels and moments for the franchise and overall story can be a bit simple but deeper themes are there. It's an interesting mess of everything, good and bad.

The Sonic and Shadow levels i enjoyed a lot however they fail to explain certain core mechanics such as rail balance, trick ramps and upgrades. The earlygame also suffers from a significant lack of movement options. Certain stages for the speed characters had problems with most abilities bound to the b button such as crazy gadget. Also for some reason Sonic has more upgrades than Shadow and same with Knuckles having the air necklace over Rouge and Eggman having the protective armour over Tails. The mech stages are intresting with lots of combo potential however the lack of movement leaves me wanting more. The treasure hunting stages on the other hand are awful with half assed hints only being able to track one emerald at a time and extremely randomized locations. Next thing i want to talk about are the extra missions for each level. Mission 2 is generally very simple having you collect 100 rings to finish the stage however in the mech and treasure hunting levels it can drag out very long as these levels weren't created like the speed stages with rings being mostly replaced by a health bar in the mech stages and the treasure hunting stages having low amounts of rings. Mission three is all about finding a lost Chao which is usually a intresting hunt, however in the kart racing levels you instead have to hit no cars which can be extremely frustrating. Mission 4 is a time trial with no checkpoints it's very rewarding in the speed stages but in the mech stages it feels pointless and in treasure hunting stages RNG can play a massive role. In the kart stages mission 4 prohibits you from hitting any walls and with the time limit these stages usually have it is one of the most frustrating things I have felt in a while. Mission 5 is a hard mode which is very boring and repetitive losing most of the stages original charm EXCEPT for the treasure hunting stages which now have 3 hard to reach but set emerald locations making them far more enjoyable. A large critique i have over this game is it's accesibility it's impossible to change any volume based settings the game controls awfully without a controller and unless the game is at 60FPS it will run faster than usual. Another complaint is that the camera is clunky and difficult to control. The Chao garden aspect of the game is super grindy and tedious. The plot is simple but had me engaged most of the way through.

Using a collection of community-made mods, I have changed the game to be closer to its Dreamcast and Japanese counterpart, and made the radar the same as Sonic Adventure 1, changed the button layout for the speed characters, and overhauled the Chao Garden with the help of Chao World Extended and its possible companion piece Enhanced Chao World. Everything else is mostly for performance's sake.\n\nWhen you get accustomed to the game's inherent quirks, it becomes enjoyable arcade fun. I will agree with the rest of the community that the ranking system does wonders to make me actually consider doing what I previously considered pointless in SA1. Achieving perfect runs makes for a satisfying gameplay loop, helped by amazing visual and sound design.\n\nI greatly enjoy the work the team has put into the soundtrack. The idea of characters getting their own personalized track for their respective moments sells the uniqueness of each one of them throughout the experience.\n\nOn a more personal note, I really miss this era of Sonic. I enjoy a lot of the games from this period, even if they are not the main 3D titles. Sonic has felt like a very insecure franchise to me in recent memory; it puts on an insincere smile and acts like we are in the best period we have seen in a long time. That makes me feel indifferent.\n\nIn contrast, this game's story and tone feel like a valid evolution from the things we have seen from the previous games. While it isn't perfect, failing in certain places, the story has a good setup, payoff, and engagement factor, those things being helped by the cast being comprised of my personal favorites of the franchise (e.g., The President and The President's Assistant).

And the worst part is, whenever you're not doing the actually fun stages with sonic and shadow, you're playing a really dull and wrongly executed platformer that is a step down from the first adventure game. \n\nThe bosses? Yeah they're even more forgettable. \n\nAll and all, if there's a way to describe this game.

now, I can confirm, from my experience, that they [b] *are* [/b] as good as people say.\n\nTalking more specifically about the sequel, Sonic Adventure 2, I feel in love with the game quickly. The feeling I had the moment I started playing the first stage \"City Escape\" was unforgettable, I couldn't stop smiling. One of the best introduction levels of the entire franchise. Just by the attitude of not only Sonic but also from the stage itself, I immediately felt that the money spent was worth it. And of course, playing the rest of it intensified this feeling even more.\n\n[b] -> Story? [/b] Although I already knew the basics of the story behind the game before playing it, it still got to me a lot (soundtrack definitely helped). Undoubtedly one of the best stories of Sonic. Also, really quotable haha!\n\n[b] -> Characters? [/b] The characterization of each one is splendid! You understand very cleary why they are who they are and what they want/need. Iconic personalities and attitude.\n\n[b] -> Gameplay? [/b] It's really fun, but since the game has three different types of gameplay/stages, the enjoyment out of it depends. My favorite are, of course, the Speed stages (Sonic/Shadow), but I also liked the Mechas/Shooting (Tails/Eggman) and Treasure Hunting (Knuckles/Rouge) stages. Although I do have some critiques for them:\n-Mechas/Shooting Stages - Kinda janky.\n-Treasure Hunting Stages - In the first Sonic Adventure, you weren't limited to look for one piece of the Master Emerald at a time, which made the entire process faster.\nAlso, I didn't really like how the camera worked sometimes, since it's automated in certain points. There were moments where I couldn't see what was ahead of me and there were times that I even lost some lives because of the camera suddenly switching position.\n\n[b] -> Level Design? [/b] We're talking about a \"Sonic Adventure\" game! Which means that it's great, unique and creative! It's a pleasantly artistic game.\n\n[b] -> Difficulty? [/b] Depends on the player, of course. From my playthroughs, I came to the conclusion that it can go from easy to hard. It has difficulty spikes, which can be frustrating to deal with, [b] *especially* [/b] at the missions. But for the most part, it's not a difficult game.\n\n[b] -> Chao Garden? [/b] Dangerously addictive (I spent hours on this thing, it's [b] that [/b] good), it's so perfect. Really, [b] REALLY [/b] well made and heartwarmingly designed. Incredible side game that adds a LOT of replayability to a game that already had reasons for a replay.\n\n[b] -> Polish? [/b] I didn't come across many bugs, but yes, as I already said, the game itself is kinda janky (That's even more visible in the ports), but still, I didn't run into serious problems.\n\n[b] -> Soundtrack? [/b] Spectacular, memorable. This series has a lot of highs and lows, but when the topic is the music, it never disappoints.\n\nI had an unforgettable experience. Yes, the game isn't perfect, but despite that, it's an amazing time. There's plenty of mods that fix most of the critiques I gave and a lot that enhance the experience even more, definitely recommend checking out if you want an [b] even better [/b] time! I'm currently trying to 100% and get all achievements, it's been challenging but really interesting indeed, hahaha.\n\n[b] Everything in Sonic Adventure 2 just screams \"iconic\", it doesn't need to try hard to look cool since it already is by essence. Sonic Movie 3 proved that even more. [/b]\nAlso, a SONIC game where we Live and Learn and also play as [b] THE [/b] Eggman?

Released on the Sega Dreamcast, it blends fast-paced action with a compelling story and memorable music. The game is split into two sides: the Hero side, featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and the Dark side, where you play as Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Rouge. This dual narrative adds depth and variety to the experience.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly engaging, with Sonic's stages offering high-speed platforming, loops, and tricks that keep the action exciting. The addition of rail grinding adds a new layer of fluidity to the movement. On the Dark side, the game shifts focus, offering slower-paced, puzzle-solving stages with unique abilities for characters like Shadow and Eggman, giving players a refreshing change of pace.\n\nThe music is a standout feature, especially with tracks like \"Live and Learn,\" which perfectly complements the game's intensity. Plus, the Chao Garden is an addictive mini-game that allows players to raise and care for cute Chao creatures, offering hours of additional fun and replayability.\n\nWith solid graphics, an engaging story, and diverse gameplay, Sonic Adventure 2 remains one of the best games in the Sonic series and a must-play for any fan of platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1735809983, "timestamp_updated": 1735809983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184512730": {"recommendationid": "184512730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849954250", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1736801898}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u624b\u611f\u597d\u7cdf\u7cd5\u771f\u7684\u73a9\u7ea2\u6e29\u4e86 \u5bf9\u5267\u60c5\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u8fd8\u662f\u722c\u53bb\u770b\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u89c6\u9891\u7b97\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1735807662, "timestamp_updated": 1735807662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184509172": {"recommendationid": "184509172", "author": {"steamid": "76561199242895090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1735922057}, "language": "english", "review": "for the people seeing this review 12 years after release. yes. get it.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735803346, "timestamp_updated": 1735803346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184506280": {"recommendationid": "184506280", "author": {"steamid": "76561199282175736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 195, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1736117725}, "language": "english", "review": "\u00f1\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735800026, "timestamp_updated": 1735800026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184504416": {"recommendationid": "184504416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126042028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 846, "playtime_at_review": 1337, "last_played": 1736613799}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego de Sonic de la historia", "timestamp_created": 1735797857, "timestamp_updated": 1735797857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184503948": {"recommendationid": "184503948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090567041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1735797201}, "language": "english", "review": "The game lags like crazy, making sonic's main form of attack borderline impossible to pull off.

This game is phenomenal. It hits me right in the childhood feels every time I hear the music. The nostalgia is so strong it floored me!

I recently Tried this out due to Sonic The Hedgehog 3 coming out recently and I thought that I'd give this a try. I hate to say it but I was really disappointed. The Gameplay: The gameplay was very clunky I feel like I died more times flying off of the stage more times than I died fighting against the enemies. The story is actually very good for it's time with the introduction of Shadow and various other threats. The soundtrack is overall amazing. The different variations of levels are quite underwhelming, The Sonic stages are fun, the Tails stages are underwhelming and annoying and the Knuckles stages are tedious and repetitive.

y en la Gamecube, hasta el dia de hoy vuelvo a jugar de vez en cuando esta joyita, en mi gusto personal es de los mejores Sonic, sin necesidad de la formula boost los niveles eran bastante atractivos y divertidos, estaban llenos de muchos elementos y cada nivel tenia 5 misiones diferentes, el contenido que trae esta entrega es bastante amplio y digo, es algo que los juegos actuales de Sonic podrian envidiar (Incluso Shadow generations, pero esa entrega a pesar de ser corta, fue de las mas enriquecedoras en cuanto historia comparado con otras entregas)\r\n\r\nTiene 2 equipos, pero a pesar de eso, solo son 3 jugabilidades (Con peque\u00f1as diferencias por Power-Ups), las jugabilidades tienen su jugo aunque se alejen bastante de la jugabilidad que te tiene acostumbrado Sonic\r\nLos jugabilidades son las siguientes (Principales):\r\n\r\nVelocidad: En esta jugabilidad se destacan Sonic y Shadow (Amy y Metal Sonic en 2P), como indica el nombre, se basa en personajes veloces, sus misiones son normalmente llegar a la meta en el menor tiempo posible y estos niveles suelen tener diferentes caminos en puntos concretos de la mision (Mas o menos como algun Sonic clasico)\r\n\r\nBusqueda del tesoro: En esta jugabilidad se destacan Knuckles y Rouge (Tikal y Chaos en 2P), nuevamente como indica el nombre, esta jugabilidad de basa en buscar ''tesoros'', suelen ser 3 objetivos a buscar por los mapas, estos suelen ser de tama\u00f1o peque\u00f1o-mediano y estan repletos de obstaculos y secretos\r\n\r\nMecha: Aqui controlaras a Tails ''Miles'' Prower y el Dr Eggman (Diferentes Chao en 2P), aqui las misiones son mas o menos como las de Velocidad, pero son lineales (A pesar de eso tienen mucho contenido y cosas por hacer), aqui nuestros personajes iran en Mechas e iran recorriendo todo el escenario mientras eliminan enemigos y abren acceso a diferentes zonas\r\n\r\nDespues tenemos minijuegos (La mayoria de desbloquean con el DLC) :luka: \r\n\r\nChao Garden: Es un jardin Chao, se basa en una zona en un jardin donde podremos criar unas peque\u00f1as criaturas adorables, podremos alimentarlas y mejorar sus estadisticas, estos comienzan siendo unos bebes y segun como los cuides ellos creceran y al llegar a la adultez tienen una posibilidad de evolucionar, la evolucion varia segun sus estadisticas y con que personaje lo cuides (Team Sonic o Team Dark)\r\n\r\nChao Race: Aqui podremos poner a nuestros chaos y competiran en carreras por diferentes escenarios/etapas en contra de otros, tenemos una barra de stamina la cual se agotara cuando le demos animo a nuestro Chao para que corra mas rapido, en cuanto se agota, el Chao pierde toda energia y correra lo mas lento posible durante el resto de la carrera\r\n\r\nPelea Chao: Nuevamente podremos utilizar a nuesto Chao en un minijuego, es automatico este modo de juego, solo puedes hacer ruido para animarlo, pero no afectara en nada, aqui solo cuenta las estadisticas que tenga tu Chao\r\n\r\nCarrera de Karts: Bueno, aqui el modo es como indica el nombre, es un modo de jeugo que si no me equivoco se desbloquea despues de X mision, los personajes de todo el cast (Jugable de 1P y 2P) competiran en carreras en unos karts, el unico power up es un peque\u00f1o boost de velocidad tras reunir cierta cantidad de anillos\r\n\r\nBoss Rush: Este modo te pondra a enfretarte jefe por jefe del modo historia, esta dividido en jefes de Team sonic, Team Dark y todos\r\n\r\ny bueno, esto deberia de ser todo, espero que fuera de utilidad, un saludo ^^", "timestamp_created": 1735491305,

Weird statement amirite? But you'll see variations of that statement everywhere.\n\nI played SA2 on DC when it released. It came out when I did not think I could be impressed unbelieveably by a game again like playing the first stage of SA1 and seeing the whale. But somehow funny enough the first stage again blew my mind in SA2. It wasn't visually unique and impressive like SA1 stage 1, but the sheer direction and fun factor of the stage is what left you wowed. I would replay the stage over and over before moving on, something newer games even 2d ones and indies fail to captivate today. This was after SA1 had manage to blow my mind during a time games were no longer impressing me, after you've played games like OOT, FF7&8, RE1-2, Metal Gear, nothing compares or exceeds, that went for yrs til games like SA1 and Soul Calibur 2 came out.\n\nThan I bought it again for the Gamecube. 2nd still loved it but clearly had problems with it and saw faults. Tails and Eggman were just not it, it was a dread to see they were the next stage. But the multiplayer added made up for it, still making it a 5/5 game.\n\nThan I played it again during the ps3 days, liked it less, the game can be buggy, broken, inconsistent and there's still tails and eggman.\n\nNow i've skipped it during the ps4 days and now played it during the ps5 days. My opinion has improved. My final verdict is, the game is still just as amazing as it were back then, the good parts work so well, that despite some jank, very dated stuff and like 30% of the game being boring due to tails and eggman, it's still super fun and super impressive. The Knuckles and Rouge segments also are better than they get credit, ppl often mistake them as the action or werewolf like segments, seeing it like that, yeah its underwhelming but they're more like Banjo-Kazooie like segments where you explore and find the collectables while doing more slower paced platforming and engaging enemies more hands on.\n\nIt truly is a game that you will both hate and love at the same time. Its both one of the best games and one of the most flawed.\n\nAlso this version sucks because they charge you dlc for free ondisc content.", "timestamp_created": 1735482175, "timestamp_updated": 1735482175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "184100584": {"recommendationid": "184100584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337949955", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1735482093}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\ude01awesome game, fuck that finalb oss", "timestamp_created": 1735481333, "timestamp_updated": 1735482884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184100175": {"recommendationid": "184100175", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032334108", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1735758257}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my Sonic adventure!", "timestamp_created": 1735481054, "timestamp_updated": 1735481054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184097527": {"recommendationid": "184097527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381520509", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11812, "last_played": 1723385960}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Fun game, cutscenes and audio may be lacking a bit but the gameplay makes up for it tenfold!", "timestamp_created": 1735479150, "timestamp_updated": 1735479150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184094257": {"recommendationid": "184094257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260604343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1735476503}, "language": "english", "review": "great game to remember playing not replaying forgot how hard some of the levels can be", "timestamp_created": 1735476646, "timestamp_updated": 1735476646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184092284": {"recommendationid": "184092284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350619784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1021, "last_played": 1735478177}, "language": "german", "review": "SANIC ADVENTURE 2 BABY!!!", "timestamp_created": 1735474986, "timestamp_updated": 1735474986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184087384": {"recommendationid": "184087384", "author": {"steamid": "76561199807842350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 992, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1736391505}, "language": "english", "review": "cool", "timestamp_created": 1735470809, "timestamp_updated": 1735470809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184086360": {"recommendationid": "184086360", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990355590", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1540214751}, "language": "english", "review": "I just can't like it... I wish I liked it, but this game has so little actual good gameplay and so much annoying stuff in it, coupled with being a bad port, having problems working on specific Nvidia gpus, by constantly crashing in every cutscene etc. That it just can't be recommended the way it is currently on Steam imo. There exist a lot of mods and other fanpatches, to make the experience better and more stable, but I'd really prefer if this game was remade entirely.\n\nIt also has voicelines cutting off from one another, which gets memed about, but its kinda funny. \n\nI do like the story of it, even though its kinda weird, but it fits the Sonic universe pretty well.\n\nThe gameplay is the worst part though. If I am playing Sonic, I want to play a game in which I can go fast and feel light while jumping and speeding around.\nYou get that, but only as Sonic or Shadow. So 2/3 of the game simply aren't enjoyable.\n\nI really don't like the mech fighting stages of Tails and Eggman, it feels like an entirely different genre, while not even being that good.\n\nBut what I hate the most is the searching stages of Knuckles and Rouge.\nSA1 At least was very open in these stages, you could fly around a lot und will find everything at some point, with the help of the rader.\nIn this game however, its often in these very tight spaces that made me ragequit the game at some point. There exists an upgrade to be able to breath underwater. If you do not get that, those searching stages that got water, will be absolute hell... and if you do not know this upgrade exists, you'll constantly be lost underwater, only hoping to get out in time or die.\n\nI just couldn't get through one of those stages, I don't quite remember how far I was into the game, but it made me so furious that I didn't want to see any more of this game. I watched it on youtube, multiple times, but playing it is hell for me.

The game is split up into two main campaigns one being the \"hero\" side with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles and the \"Dark\" side campaign with Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge who basically play the same as the hero side just with different levels.\r\n\r\nI find the Sonic/Shadow stages to be the most fun, but at the same time they also have a lot of issues. There's some weird physics going on in this game where your character will have trouble going side to side on half-pipe structures and hitting any wall will stop your momentum dead in its tracks. Your homing ability also doesn't always work the way you want it to, and there were so, so many times where I would try to home in onto a grind rail or enemy and it just wouldn't work so I would fly off the edge of the stage and die. Sonic/Shadow have very sensitive controls especially when they reach high speed, and depending on the level you'll find that \"flow-state\" being broken a lot. Some levels are better than others though, like the first level City Escape has pretty much none of these issues while the final level of both Sonic/Shadows campaign will have you tearing your hair out.\r\n\r\nThe Knuckles and Rouge stages I'm 50/50 on. I like the Knuckles ones for the most part, they have a lot of replay value with how the items you have to collect are randomized every time so that's cool. I like the vibes of some of them too, they're more laid-back and a nice break from the fast Sonic levels. But man, I HATED most of Rouge's levels. It mostly comes down to the level design of them being annoying to navigate due to the verticality of some of them and gimmicks like being on a time limit and having to find switches to open safe's around the map to progress. There's another level where the hints that you normally use to help you find the items you need start lying to you, but only sometimes? Sometimes the hints are written in reverse as well and I don't know if those ones are lying and I don't know man. I was pretty much mentally done with the game by the time I reached this one.\r\n\r\nThe Eggman/Tails stages are the most competent and mechanically polished out of the three gameplay types, but are also really easy. You basically just hold the shoot button down to lock-on to enemies and run through, releasing it periodically to kill enemies and repeating. There's this really high pitched beeping sound when you're locking on that legit hurts my ears and so I tried to mod it out, but the mod didn't work so I just played regularly. I find these to be pretty fun, they didn't frustrate me much.\r\n\r\nI don't like how the story is told either, it doesn't feel cohesive at all and a lot of it I simply didn't understand due to the voice acting that I'm assuming a good portion of was lost in translation. I don't think the story is bad exactly, it's just the execution of it that is. I understand the gist of it now especially after having seen the Sonic 3 movie (which tells the story of Shadow much better I might add) but the game skips around all over the place between levels so I stopped paying attention to it pretty quickly. The cutscenes are fun to laugh at because they are really poorly animated and the voice acting is nearly RE1-tier, so that's a fun time.\r\n\r\nI feel like Sonic Adventure 2 has a lot of potential, there's plenty of good ideas in here. I like the level themes and the concept of the different gameplay styles. I like the chao garden stuff and some of the stages (or parts of them) are genuinely really fun to play, but others just flat-out suck. I would love to see this game get remade in the future, this is the type of game that could really benefit from one. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone to be honest, unless you are willing to put up with a lotta jank. I thought I could, but I guess I wasn't strong enough.", "timestamp_created": 1735423469, "timestamp_updated": 1735423469, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184032052": {"recommendationid": "184032052", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014663065", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 786, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1736805057}, "language": "latam", "review": "Sonic es E-S-E-N-C-I-A \ud83d\udeac", "timestamp_created": 1735421776, "timestamp_updated": 1735421776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588235259056091309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184031450": {"recommendationid": "184031450", "author": {"steamid": "76561199545907207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1736744530}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always wanted to play this game and now that I saw Sonic Movie 3, I felt like now I just HAD to play the game.

Las canciones de Crush 40 y los temas de los personajes del OST junto con los efectos durante el gameplay son de lo mejor de la \u00e9poca. Tambi\u00e9n es de aplaudir que el juego combina distintos elementos a un esquema de juego dividido en diferentes formas (Los niveles de Sonica/Shadow, Knuckles/Rouge, Tails/Eggman y el Chao Garden); esto es notorio cuando accedes al Chao Garden con personajes que sus modos de juego difieren de los niveles de velocidad.\r\n\r\nEn general es un 9/10 y es una experiencia de lo m\u00e1s agradable, el factor de dificultad evoluciona bien con el avance del juego y el contenido desbloqueable incita debidamente al replay-value.\r\n\r\nNo entiendo el problema de muchos en los foros sobre la optimizaci\u00f3n del control, pero en mi caso solo conect\u00e9 mi control de Xbox Series a la PC y pude disfrutar del juego de principio a fin.

with Sonic and Shadow and sometimes the levels can get you stumped for example Knuckles' and Rouge's stages are all about looking for things which can take up to 10 minutes to complete but otherwise its fun to do. The only issue I had with this game is the Final Course stage every character except for Shadow competes in the level, basically it starts of with tails and ends with sonic but if you run out of your lives you return back to Tails and have to restart the level that's the only thing I was stumped on otherwise the boss fights are easy and the ending of the game and other mini-games are so much fun

You can't switch rails or balance on them properly. The INPUT CONTROLS MOD fixes this, although it will still feel slightly twitchy at first, it will feel a lot better once your muscle memory adjusts. \n\nTwo more mods for fixing issues with this game's port are the Sa2 volume Controls & Sa2 Render Fix. These are the main mods required for fixing the port, you'll need the Sa2 mod manager which will be on the mod page. It's as simple as extracting/copy and pasting the mod manager into the game files and the mods into the mod folder (create one if one doesn't exist,) then open the mod manager, tick the box then save and your done.\n\nMods that are not required but improve the game:\n\nBetter Radar - this improves the treasure-hunting stages, making them faster to complete. A tip for these stages that the game doesn't tell you (mod not required) is that interacting with the monitors in each stage will give you three hints to the location of each emerald shard. There's also a very useful upgrade in Aquatic Mine for knuckles.\n\nAction Remap - Rebinds the light speed dash to Y/triangle so you don't accidentally perform the wrong action\n\nReduce Spin dash Delay code in the codes segment of the mod manager - this simply reduces the delay between pressing X/square and when the spin dash begins charging, making it faster to perform and improving game flow.\n\nInfinite lives code in the codes segment of the mod manager - speaks for itself. In case you don't like the lives mechanic.\n\nThat's about all that is needed for the game. Hopefully explained in an easy to understand way for newcomers.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735140758, "timestamp_updated": 1735140758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 273, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.963129520416259766", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183658037": {"recommendationid": "183658037", "author": {"steamid": "76561199114980005", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1735141826}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best video games ever made.

There are still some jank stages at the very end where you constantly fall to your death because you touched a button -- heaven forbid you try to have some agency in your rail-grinding speed-fest! And the final boss before the final boss... aka the BIoLizard nearly had me rage quiting (ended up enabling a cheat in the mod manager as I just wanted to see the final FINAL boss). \n\nBut what SA2 does well, it does brilliantly! Fantastic story, best introduction of a character into the franchise, addicting mini-game in the Chao Garden, and streamlined gameplay from Sonic Adventure.

Aunque he de admitir que muchas veces el ritmo entre la historia Hero y la historia Dark suele ser muy inconsistente, lo que indirectamente cause fatiga ciertas partes, como los niveles de Knuckles o Rouge que no se sienten del todo conectados con el conflicto principal. Todo lo que abarca la historia Last, desde el team up de heroes y villanos as\u00ed como la redenci\u00f3n de Shadow y esa hermosa e iconica batalla final es de lo mejorcito del juego, se siente genial haber llegado hasta esa parte de la historia; y el sacrificio de Shadow es algo que el juego se toma en serio y s\u00ed llega a dar un poco de tristeza\r\n\r\nSobre lo jugable los niveles de Sonic y Shadow son geniales, gran adrenalina, velocidad y plataformeo, adem\u00e1s de un verdadero reto si quieres conseguir el rango A en todas las fases y sus respectivas misiones secundarias. Es una l\u00e1stima no pueda decir lo mismo de los niveles de Tails/Eggman y de Knuckles/Rouge, los niveles de mechas si bien es satisfactorio ir apuntando y destruyendo todo en el camino es muy tedioso que hayan muchos de estos niveles en todo el juego, es r\u00eddiculo que Shadow solo tenga 4 niveles y Eggman 6, cuando debi\u00f3 ser al rev\u00e9s. Sobre los niveles de tesoros siento que no estan tan mal salvo los ultimos niveles, el \u00faltimo nivel de Rouge es de las peores cosas que he jugado en mi vida, quien se que haya dise\u00f1ado ese nivel seguramente quer\u00eda desquitarse.\r\n\r\nCompletar este juego al 100%, con todos sus emblemas y logros ha sido todo un viaje que aprecio demasiado, adem\u00e1s ha expandido mi punto de vista sobre este y m\u00e1s juegos del erizo azul. Es un gran juego que recomiendo mucho a fans y casuales de la saga, estoy seguro que a pesar de sus fallas la pasar\u00e1n bastante bien, aprovechen las ofertas porque esta a 2 dolares y por ese precio es una ganga, recomiendo jugarlo antes de ver Sonic 3 la pel\u00edcula, pues dicha pelicula es una adaptaci\u00f3n directa de este juego.
