The dialogue, story, and storytelling is tip-top...but that's the only RPG element this game excels at. The rest is basic AF. There's no reward for exploration (except for healing items), no sense of finding things for your own. The sidequests are shoehorned into the rails; you can't just talk to an NPC and complete a miniquest; you are told what your sidequests are and are graded on them. It's a glorified visual novel with interactive battles between story scenes. Again, the story, storytelling, and dialogue are top-tier in this regard...but it feels like a very watery rpg as a result.\r\n\r\nI'm only not recommending it as a response to the mystifying \"overwhelmingly positive\" it currently has.

Basically the girls in your group almost get kidnapped and raped and in they are like No big deal people raping people is perfectly fine lets go have tea.  I am sitting there going...So bracers normally allow girls to be kidnapped and raped in this world and they think that is fine? There is a ton of other terrible parts in the story that just don't make any sense. Pretty much the armies and leadership are all corrupt and the relationships are a goofy mess. I wouldn't bother following the story as it's terrible but again the gameplay itself isn't bad just has horrible illogically written characters and actions. Some emergency happens and characters have a few seconds to react and can easily solve the situtation. Lets have them have a super long conversation about how dangerouse the situtation is and have them stand there doing nothing.  The bad guys escape like seven hundred times because the characters just sat there talking about the most pointless things. It really kills the game as just picture a guy trying to stab you and slit your throat and after you knock him backwords would you turn around and talk to your friend for twenty minutes? No but for some reason they do that in this game constently. It gets far worse as it starts pushing the trans sexual crap as well. Tired of this garbage.

Completionists beware.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a beloved series by many, myself included. So often throughout the story I found myself chuckling at the character interactions, even [u]laughing out loud[/u] at some of the anime-like interactions that always felt very... human. Very relatable. On this ground alone, I can see why this game has various sequels, and a remaster coming in 2025. \nThe gameplay has a turn-based field system where positioning of your characters can be as important as what 'magic' you use. Which btw, the 'magic' system (known as 'Arts') is quite an interesting system by it's own right. Using 'Quartz', one can change a character's Arts as you play through the game, changing that character's role by changing what Arts they can use.\n\nNow, this part is just for completionists, and I consider myself to be one. If you want to REALLY explore everything this game has to offer... you're gonna [u][b]need[/b][/u] a guide. That's non-optional. Many times, this game makes you complete quests within a small window of timeframe, and simply expects that you'll know to do so, and how to do them. Multiple times I had to backtrack to get a specific item from an npc for 100% completion (i.e. the collectable novels), and I'm just supposed to KNOW which npc and what part of the game I can get the item from. Sure, this game has save slots whereby you can reload and obtain this item... if you remember. It's a part of 2000's game saving that I will NOT miss.\nEven so... this game in particular has plenty of guides, so a spoiler-free run is more than possible, and I'll mention the steam guides I used below.\n\nSo, did I overall enjoy the game? Absolutely. The game runs at a very slow pace though, and at one point of my gameplay I forgot what button it was to speed up gameplay was (hint: It's Left Alt), which left me waiting through turn-based battles and major backtracking for items and quests for about 3 hours: those 3 hours was the worst experience I had with this game, and I am SO thankful this game has a speed-up-button.\nWill I play the sequel? Mmmm... maybe. As much as I enjoyed this game (and as cheap as it was), I might just wait for a remaster. Or watch someone else play it.\n\nIt's hard for me to recommend this game, because a sequel is supposed to be coming out the year I'm writing this review. Even if you don't want to buy the game, or even buy it when it's on sale... I would still recommend you immerse yourself in the series. Xseed games is the same creator of my beloved Rune Factory 4, so I look forward to the sequel of this game, and any other rpgs they put out!\n\nShoutout to ErickaUnlimited and Shuuzu's 100% achievement guides. They were a BIG help in me getting a spoiler-free, 100% first-time-run without much headache.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863854416\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1089109429", "timestamp_created": 1736413484, "timestamp_updated": 1736413484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185163538": {"recommendationid": "185163538", "author": {"steamid": "76561199583824426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1734709802}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u0448\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c", "timestamp_created": 1736403521, "timestamp_updated": 1736403521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185156369": {"recommendationid": "185156369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240040614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3325, "last_played": 1733822610}, "language": "english", "review": "local she/her himbo estelle bright, having recently turned 16 and thus met the age requirement, cheerfully joins the bracer guild (civilians' Local Hero union)! together with her foster brother and clear haver of backstory most tragique joshua, resolves to travel around the country to get the letters of recommendation from every guild branch that will allow her to graduate from rookie status. along the way she will meet funny friends, do So Many Sidequests, have many a romcom hijink with joshua, and also trip over what is definitely not a 10-car pileup of weird cult conspiracies Do Not Worry About It Im Sure Its Fine.\r\n\r\nTHE THING EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW BEFORE PURCHASING TRAILS IN THE SKY IS: this game is the first 50something hours of a 150-hour game that got split into two separate games because there was just an absurd amount of game in that game. in order to get the most fulfilling experience, you will need to also purchase the immediate sequel, TRAILS IN THE SKY SC. additionally make sure that you keep your save data between games because SC can use that data to give you extra dialogue based on the sidequests you've completed here.\r\n\r\nselling points for trails in the sky include its charming low-poly environs, a system that allows you some freedom to custom-spec your party members, and the fact that npc behavior updates every time the main story progresses, including a bunch of mini narratives about families and couples and so forth that continue throughout this game and the next one.\r\n\r\nunfortunately while trails in the sky is generally a pretty enjoyable time, there are a handful of This Game Was Written In 2004 moments that have a sharp dip in quality compared to the rest of the story, and if they make you wince you'll have a lot of wincing to do.

The Legend of Heroes series (at least post-reboot, I intend to try the five entries before Sky sometime in the future, though) has fully opened my eyes to the genre, being a genuinely clever, well-crafted experience with little flaws in its core gameplay loop. While I have only played Sky FC, I'm excited for future entries as they seem both more deep mechanically and deep in story- but Sky FC was a very good first entry, despite it's growing pains.\n\nAs of this review, I have just completed Trails in the Sky for the first time on Hard Difficulty, opting to skip Normal after learning about a number of errors I made on my initial playthrough up to the First Chapter. I've had very few issues with Trails in the Sky- most of them being circumvented by being able to try unique strategies, and the sheer number of saves the game lets you have to get around it's growing pains. However, the game does have a few very particular flaws, due to being the first entry in the series.\n\nFor one, the game has a number of random, rather sudden difficulty spikes- some scripted encounters seemingly having been made with a different party in mind compared to the team you have, and some expecting you to be a higher level than you would've naturally been, even after completing everything. There are a few cases like this, but ultimately, this didn't sour the experience very much for me, as usually giving it some time and a few tries would be enough, and if that wasn't the case, grinding didn't take too long. That, or maybe I should've just fought everything I encountered? I'm not sure, but I tended to run from fights when I got ambushed or when I was at a decent enough level...\n\nSecondly, I believe some mechanics, while explained, are not explained to the best of their ability. These mechanics only enhance the game, but they are just something to keep an eye out for. I feel Bonus Bracer Points and Hidden Quests could have been handled or explained better, especially since they are only really explained vaguely in comparison to their greater scheme when initially brought up to the player, as Falcom intended for them to be a repeat-playthrough mechanic. The average player would not know of how deeply rooted either of these mechanics are until around mid-Chapter 2, when more of their intricacies are explicitly demonstrated to you during the Lighthouse Quest. Especially frustrating for me, because I beat the game missing one entire bracer point... getting spotted in the Perzel Farm quest in the Prologue makes you lose points. I didn't notice this until the end of Chapter 1, since I had to check a guide because I wasn't sure what to do during a quest, and I had been using the same save for everything... Now I have 40 saves and 367 BP. Mechanically, though, these are probably some of the best aspects of the game at the same time- they make you get more attached to the story the more you try to complete the game.\n\nMy main point of advice is to try not to stress yourself out with the specifics unless you wish to seek higher completion. The game itself is perfectly fine for video game standards, and it was a fun challenge playing it on Hard Mode! If I had to suggest a guide for this game, the Kiseki Fandom Wiki has a list of which tasks are hidden or not, as well as bullet points of what you need to do and when your timeframe for completion is, while CrimsonTear's website provides more depth. I used both for my playthrough after completing the Prologue. I wonder if anyone 100%ed this game on their first try?\n\nRegardless, a casual playthrough is genuinely a good time. My main goal was to complete all the jobs with the additional task of getting 1st Class, and while I did this, I had a lot of enjoyment in just experiencing what the game had to offer. The worldbuilding is fantastic, and a lot is alluded to in this entry alone. Seeing something that I learned would appear in a later entry always caught my eye. The combat is, in my opinion, genuinely some of the most mechanically engaging gameplay I've had the pleasure of utilizing. Every character feels great to use, and the battle system feels extremely dynamic. The storytelling is some of the best I've seen so far, too, with the amount of depth behind every single thing impressing me a lot. I'm looking forward to playing the future entries where everything is more established. To be completely honest, I may just be so openly positive about the game because most of my previous fare in the medium wasn't the best there was to offer. Regardless, I'm looking forward to playing Sky SC, and I've even had the thought of going back and playing the game again casually on Normal/NG+ or even on Nightmare so I can catch any achievements I missed on my first playthrough.\n\nAdditional notes:\nThis game has permanently changed the direction of my life\n\nBracer Stats (First Playthrough)\n1st Class\nJobs -

Here are some things I would tell my past self to sell him or give general advice.\n\nFor Sky 1 specifically:\n- This is the first game in the whole series, if you wanna get into trails start here, they're not like other RPG series where each entry is barely related to the last, play em all in order. Sky 1-3 -> Zero and Azure -> Cold Steel 1-4 -> Reverie -> Daybreak\n- There is a fanmade patch to add the JP voices from the console releases of the 3 sky games, absolutely get it it's basically fully voice-acted. \n- There is a remake coming up at the end of 2025, IMO play this anyway cause it's very charming to see the series grow over time and it'd be quite jarring to start with the most modern version then go back to the oldest to continue. Also the graphics haven't aged poorly at all, I adore how the early trails games look and am very happy that I chose to play em\n- If you're enjoying Sky 1 get Sky 2 as well before whatever sale you're on is over, they're two halves of the same story\n\nTrails as a whole:\n- Amazing series of turn-based JRPGs that's fully available on steam, all ports are good, no weird BS you need to do to enjoy em\n- Trails games are very much story RPGs, some of them can get very restrictive with not letting you to choose your party members for story reasons and so on. Still the orbment system (basically how you build your characters) adds a high level of customization so it still feels like it gives the player a good bit of freedom at all times, and I'd say the gameplay is amazing all the way through\n- Some peeps say you gotta play a bunch of boring games first to get to the good trails. I agree that the newer trails are easier to sell people on cause they're much flashier and got hype factor but the old ones are by no means bad. Sky trilogy was very fun to play through and my fav trails game is only the 4th release out of the 11 I played\n\nSo yeah, TLDR I recommend this series if you want to get into a huge turn-based RPG world where all the stories are related to each other.

Some like to call this the \"One Piece of JRPGS,\" and I'd like to agree. It's a very daunting and long series not meant for everyone. Personally, I wanted to start with the Cold Steel arc because I was afraid that the Sky trilogy being older might not hold up as well, but I was mistaken. \n\nAs the start of the Trails series, serving as the beginning to the Liberl arc we are introduced to Estelle Bright and her adopted brother Joshua, who journey through the country of Liberl to train and become senior rank Bracers. This multinational organization acts to keep the peace and protect civilians. Their travels will take them to all the major towns in Liberl where they can explore and help the local populace with their troubles. Gaining trust, eventually earning you recommendations from the Bracer guild of said town which enables you to move to the next city. This game has a Prologue along with 4 chapters, all of which are pretty long. This is because FC (First Chapter) and SC (Second Chapter), were originally meant to be one game, but due to the size of it all nihon falcom split them into 2.\n\nDue to my original worries, I was hesitant about the gameplay. I can with confidence say that the game holds up quite well even in 2025. The gameplay while quite simple provides a layer of depth with the quartz/orbment system. You can go to town to customize the abilities of your party for whatever suits your needs. Suffice it to say for me, I got quite a whiplash from it at the start, but as I progressed more throughout the story, I unlocked more orbments and it was pretty smooth sailing from there. The game doesn't want you to grind either, in that regard it's pretty fair since you'll be doing a fair bit of sidequests to help the local populous with their troubles. \n\nAdditionally, I have to give major props to the Falcom Sound Team. The OST perfectly complements FC's vibe. The soundtrack is filled to the brim with amazing tracks that only enhance your journey as you travel across Liberl. My Personal Favorites have to be Secret Green Passage and Hollow Light of the Sealed Land, along with one of the best Battle BGMs, Sophisticated Fight.\n\nWhat it doesn't do well for me is that the overall story was kind of weak. It only started to ramp up from Chapter 3 onwards. The game often does this thing of not naming stuff, instead, they opt for vaguely naming important characters or places in a sort of wink-wink fashion, which annoyed me a tiny bit since it's supposed to be the start of the journey, but in the end, it wouldn't be that fun if they revealed all their aces early on. \n\nUltimately, even with the negatives I'm willing to overlook them for the most part. It would be a different conversation if this was a standalone game, but this game mainly serves to establish and set up the overarching lore of the entire franchise. If you want to start the Trails series you can pick this game up for pretty cheap, or you can wait for the remake named \"Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter\" that's coming out in Fall 2025. Either way, it's a great game to start the series with.", "timestamp_created": 1735950190, "timestamp_updated": 1736098907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

If someone told me they hated it and never want to touch it again, I'd at least understand. That being said, the Trails series is by far, hands down, my favorite JRPG series. The level of care, detail, and attention given to its setting and characters is genuinely something I've never seen in the medium before or since.\n\nSeeing protagonists and important characters return in later games as anything from cameos to important NPCs to playable protagonists again is just incredibly satisfying, and its the only game series that makes me genuinely giddy to see an old friend make a reappearance. As a longtime gamemaster in tabletop RPGs I can't tell you how impressed I am with how well they keep the continuity between games and arcs and allow past games to properly impact the future ones.\n\nIt'd be incorrect to say that EVERY NPC is super important, there are hundreds of minor incidental NPCs, but even then many of those have very fleshed out lives and stories that play out and change IF you take the time to talk to them and invest in remembering them. \n\nThat being said If you want to play these games and see most or all of the side content or get the top Bracer/Dept./Academic ranking then for the love of god PLAY THESE GAMES WITH A GUIDE. These games, especially the older ones, DO NOT hold your hand when it comes to optional content, you WILL miss quests, gear, quartz, achievements, etc. Save yourself the trouble and just use a guide, it DOES NOT diminish the story or gameplay.\n\nLastly, play these games in release order for maximum enjoyment. These are not stand alone games, if you play a sequel game within an arc before the previous ones you'll be lost, and if you play a sequel arc before the previous ones you'll spoil yourself and/or miss a ton of context.\n\nRelease order is: \n[list]\n[h3]Liberl Arc[/h3] \n    [*]Trails in the Sky FC\n    [*]Trails in the Sky SC\n    [*]Trails in the Sky 3rd\n[h3]Crossbell Arc[/h3]\n    [*]Trails from Zero\n    [*]Trails to Azure\n[h3]Erebonia Arc[/h3]\n    [*]Trails from Cold Steel 1\n    [*]Trails from Cold Steel 2\n    [*]Trails from Cold Steel 3\n    [*]Trails from Cold Steel 4\n[h3]Reverie[/h3]\n    [*]Trails into Reverie\n[h3]Calvard Arc[/h3]\n    [*]Trails through Daybreak\n    [*]Trails through Daybreak 2 (Not released in English)\n    [*]Farewell, O Zemuria (Not released in English)\n[/list]\n\nI actually started with Cold Steel 1 before going back to Trails in the Sky FC and going in order from there and It didn't impact my enjoyment too much but you WILL get so much more out the series if you go in order. DO NOT play Cold Steel 2 onward before the Crossbell arc, you will spoil so much for yourself as the climax of the Crossbell arc take place concurrently with Cold Steel 2.\n\n[h2] Series Pros [/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*]The characters are genuinely great. With one exception [spoiler] Josette [/spoiler] there was not a single main, secondary, or tertiary character that I didn't eventually come to love or at least appreciate. [spoiler] And even Josette gets a lot better in later games. [/spoiler]\n\n    [*] The characters are tropey, but not tropes. You'll see the good boy who tries hard, or the angry guy with a big sword, but while that might inform your first impression of a character, pretty much all of them have a lot more depth to them. for example Estelle might initially seem like just the obnoxiously optimistic tomboy, but [spoiler]she's got a lot of self doubt and struggles to measure up to the multitude of genuine superhumans in her life.[/spoiler]\n\n    [*]The story and setting is continuously built upon and expanded as the series continues, and in ways that usually make sense.\n\n    [*]The world feels alive. After almost every major story event virtually every accessible NPC will have their dialogue and/or positioning updated. Feels more like a living world than any Bethesda game.\n\n    [*]The combat is fun even after mastering it and continues to subtly change and refine itself with each game.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] Series Cons [/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*]\"It's like Poetry... It rhymes.\" You will see this series do the same things again and again, across games, across arcs, across the series. The same quests, the same locations, the same plot structures, the same locations in different countries, the same villain archetypes. You will start to call plot points and see villains from miles away. Ultimately the series does keep it fresh enough for me to stay invested, but I could see this being a HUGE problem for many people.\n\n    [*]These games want you to miss stuff. Especially the earlier ones. I'll stress this again, if you want to do all or most of the side content, use a guide, even then you'll probably fuck up at least a half a dozen missables and want to eat a brick. [spoiler] Fucking Anton in SC... [/spoiler]\n\n    [*]The combat can usually be solved in such a way that fights are either \"walk in the park easy\" or \"OMFG can I please get a turn!?\" If you know what you're doing fights with a medium difficulty are virtually non-existent.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Trails in the Sky FC Review [/h1]\n\nThis game will be your biggest barrier [spoiler] sorry Lloyd [/spoiler] to entry for this series, and that is for two reasons. It's the oldest game in the series so some of the mechanics have not aged especially gracefully and on its own the story itself is kind of languid and feels like the lowest stakes in the series. \n\nThis game and Trails in the Sky SC have a frustrating habit of sticking you with only 2-3 party members for an unforgivably large portion of the game, and these are games that DO NOT balance out well with a party of less than 4.\n\nThat being said this game also introduces some of the best characters in the series. Estelle, Joshua, Cassius, Tita, Agate, and Olivier are still some of my all-time favorite characters in the series. \n\nIt's also a solid base to build the rest of the series on. It starts a bit slow and takes a while to really ramp up but it gives a good foundation of knowledge and the experience of the people living in Liberl so that events that take place later in the series have more impact. As its own game it can honestly be a bit lacking, but when paired with SC it's a great \"mellow\" first half. It's a game I look back fondly on, but i'm honestly not in any rush to play it again.\n\n[h2] Trails in the Sky FC Pros [/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Great characters\n\n    [*]Lays a good foundation for the events of the next few games\n\n    [*]I initially thought the character art looked off, but it really grew on me, those original portraits of the characters are now some of my favorites in the series.\n\n    [*]Did I mention the characters? I love this cast. Might seem cheap to put this twice, but they're that good.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] Trails in the Sky FC Cons [/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Can be a slow start, the story doesn't really pick up till the last few chapters.\n\n    [*]JUST GIVE ME 4 CHARACTERS ALREADY!\n\n    [*]Kind of weak as a standalone game, but works well as a part of the Liberl Arc.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1735488078, "timestamp_updated": 1735488660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537537515163421631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184107419": {"recommendationid": "184107419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072999826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1735485574}, "language": "english", "review": "(Actual playtime ~43 hrs)\n\nIf you're getting this game in a sale, definitely pick up the SC (Second Chapter) as well.

The story follows Estelle and Joshua in their journey to become full fledged bracers, while uncovering mysteries surrounding the region. \n\nBecause this is an old jrpg, combat is also pretty simple, you attack with physical damage or use arts to do magic damage. The good thing is, you can fully customize what sort of arts you want to use for each characters. So this journey feels more chill and personal. \n\nCharacters are also very fun to interact with, some players complain about the long pep talk, but that is what gives them character. \n\nThe most important factor for me is that this game doesn't require hours of mindless grinding just to win. Exp gained is based on level difference (I believe) and if you are overleveled, you only get 1 exp, conversely, if you are severely underleveled, they will give you as much as 100exp per kill to compensate. So now, you just have to play through the game normally without having to stop and grind.\n\nNow for the cons, this game randomly turns your camera angle everytime you enter a new area or leave combat. This resulted in frequent navigation problems as you unknowingly backtrack because your camera got flipped, this problem is even worse in dungeons where no minimap is available, I do hope future games doesn't do that. \n\nCharacters have ultimate abilities called S-crafts that can be activated in the middle of your enemies' turn. While it is good as it add an extra later of strategic depth, many a times I accidentally activate someone's S-craft during my turn because I press an arrow button off the combat menu. I hope future games disable that feature during your turn and just loop the selection back to the bottom of menu.\n\nA minor critique with combat I found is that damage arts spells (especially single target arts) feels incredibly inefficient, you're better attacking normally to get more consistent damage. Maybe add advanced level single target spells rather than having only AOE spells at that tier. Buffs and debuffs are balanced.\n\n[h1]Spoiler alert: Small comment on story:[/h1]\n[spoiler]The story was great from prologue to chapter 3, but I think they overcooked chapter 4 a little bit, should have ended after rescuing Queen Alicia.
