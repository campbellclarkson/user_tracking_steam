If you're an old school fan of anime and an oh-ho-ho~ kind of reflective, pseudo-antagonist, then you'll be familiar with not only the humor, but the art style, the music...even the sound design is wonderfully reminiscent of the RPG Maker-esque era in which this was born. Whoever did the work on the English subtitles on this game understood their assignment. Whoever the VAs are for the various characters deserve more than they probably made back in the day.

But the shop is where the meat is, haggling is an obscure mechanic just obtuse enough to be interesting and a little frustrating without resorting to outright cheating. You can learn a customers patterns, desires and budget. But its never explicitly told to you, you just gotta figure it out.\nA more modern game would probably just leave it all in the hands of baby RNGJesus, and he's a baby. He can't hold shit.\nLiterally.\n\nI think that's the secret to Recettear, its simple. But intentionally designed from the ground up. Which makes for a great feeling game.\n\nStory is a B+\nIts generic moe fantasy stuff, not a lot of depth or bite but the characters got a few chuckles out of me. If your someone who needs everything to be about the end of the world and all super serious, look else where. If you can tolerate some tropey anime cheese than this is a story for you. But be warned, the game is very difficult. I am almost 8 hours in and I've never made it past the third loan payment. \n\nOverall, a great game.
