They're a buggy, janky, poorly made afterthought with lazy, cheating AI. \n\nThe campaign map mechanics are especially a mess, full of random quirks that make no sense. For instance, if an enemy attacks into your big army, none of your ground units can move until you fight the battle, and then the battle magically depletes ALL initiative (move points) for ALL your units! So they can keep you from ever moving your army again by just suiciding something tiny at you every turn. \n\nAnd then the way zone control for battles changes is super buggy, the core logic itself is quite convoluted, there are a lot of reasons zone control can change from battle to battle. But even besides all those rules, sometimes it will just randomly change, you'll have just won a total victory and routed the enemy army, and then they attack again next turn and nonsensically you're knocked down to Alamo configuration (one zone versus all others) for no reason whatsoever. \n\nI could go on...moving your aircraft to a new airfield uses up all movement, when it should be as simple as \"hey, just land here when you're done this turn 'k?\" The \"routing retreating armies\" mechanic seems like it wasn't playtested, it can be really easily exploited if you have a helicopter squad, doing silly nonsensical things like sending that heli squad out over an enemy sector so it doesn't get its entire initiative zapped by a fight, then when the enemy army routs, send those helis at the retreating army, and voila, you just eradicated an entire enemy army with 4 helis.\n\nThe git gud edgelords will say any criticism is because you suck, but no, I'm beating the campaigns. It just feels cheesy, buggy, and undeserved when you're losing, until you figure out how to exploit the AI and janky game mechanics, and then it feels cheesy, buggy, and undeserved when you're winning.", "timestamp_created": 1737274265, "timestamp_updated": 1737274265, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185914755": {"recommendationid": "185914755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390503032", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1737357202}, "language": "english", "review": "0/10\nAt a glance the game looks very promising and I am disappointed to have to leave this review, but this is just unforgivable.
