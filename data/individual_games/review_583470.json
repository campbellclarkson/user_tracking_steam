A name that truly haunts us all for generations to come and is well-known for The Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy. Edmund has torn UP my meat several times (in both ways, if your asking.) and from that came \"The End is Nigh!\". Its a platformer... I mean DUH LOOK AT THE TRAILER! \r\n\r\nYou control Ash, a literal tumor-infested ball of tar that looks like if Gish had intercourse with the weird sludge from a sewer pipe and hes LONELY. He needs a friend in his life and especially because he's in the middle of a post-apoc world! So he decides to finally leave his house after his game cartridge that he played for decades breaks! Ash has some methods man... Wish I had em.\r\n\r\nOkay so you control this blob of tar through some of the most craziest shit that cranks it up to 11. It truly felt like a hangover once you ACTUALLY beat this game and its achievements. This game DEMANDS you to shoot your load at it and it MUST be plentiful! How do you do this and how dose it relate to the game? \r\n\r\nThe game FORCES you to grow a pair of balls and skills thats what! If you didn't like Super Meat Boy's achievements then you can say good bye to your small BALLS because this game will absolutely turn you inside out. My first playthrough felt like me stepping on negative-degree ice. IT HURT. but once you actually get the hang of this thing, you actually start to enjoy IT. Kinky or not this review, this game is WORTH your money.\r\n\r\nSome guy in the back of a seven-eleven sold me sushi and a copy of this game he found at his nearest wallmart. The guy was in blue and I had no idea who the hell was this guy because I never payed attention to his apperance. I just took the cocaine and ran because he's my DEALER. So when he offered a little something on the side, I obviously took it.\r\n\r\n9/10 GOOD GAME.
