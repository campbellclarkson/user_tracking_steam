I've played a few different titles now (including the fantastic Wii title) and no other racing game series has captured me like this one. It is pure game. Easy to pick-up, hard to master.  The controls are simple and the physics are easy to understand. How you apply these things is the crux of the game. I am convinced anyone, even those who don't play racing games can pick this game up and within a few hours feel like they've learned something and feel a sense of accomplishment as they see how far they've progressed.\r\n\r\nLike every other entry, this one has tons of content to get through. A juicy campaign of short tracks in slightly increasing complexity and challenge and you will spend hours on upon on this game. It is addicting, trying to get the Gold medal on every track ( and for the truly devoted, the Author's medal). Some tracks are annoying, some tracks are brilliant, but they are all satisfying to complete.\r\n\r\nThe music fits this game perfectly, chill and upbeat. It works great for this game.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are surprisingly really sharp for how old this particular title is.\r\n\r\nI'm the type to be satisfied playing the in-built campaign but the other half of this game is the player-made tracks of which there are infinite amounts. If you're the creative type you have a powerful course creation tool that will be sure to keep you occupied.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is an easy recommend, especially for 10 bucks or less. I prefer it over the current live-service version that Ubisoft has going (although to be fair that one is still really fun).", "timestamp_created": 1735759295, "timestamp_updated": 1735759295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184322859": {"recommendationid": "184322859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036305168", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1438, "last_played": 1735648797}, "language": "danish", "review": "motherfuck yes! :thumbs_up:", "timestamp_created": 1735647644, "timestamp_updated": 1735647644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183926696": {"recommendationid": "183926696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198816215087", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1219, "playtime_at_review": 4854, "last_played": 1736706529}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1735340778, "timestamp_updated": 1735340778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183902455": {"recommendationid": "183902455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346120081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1733043576}, "language": "schinese", "review": " \u597d\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1735323933, "timestamp_updated": 1735323933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183882638": {"recommendationid": "183882638", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379143924", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2169, "last_played": 1735420955}, "language": "english", "review": "Best looking trackmania game by far and has a solid campaign.
