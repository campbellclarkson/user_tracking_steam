The combat is basic and kind of fun...but no purpose to game other than that. I don't understand why it got abandoned, damn shame....only had to add a few things to find a purpose to finish the game, but NOPE. Just straight up dropped project in steam and left.\n\nSTEAM should not try to sell these as if it was a game, it should go in the LOST AND FOUND section (its not real, but STEAM should make one for titles like this - A Game you can play, but it's not finished, and it got dropped in a dumpster).\n\nDon't buy it unless under $6.

Set sail to a basic procedure generated set of maps and do whatever you want. You can earn gold through trades, quest, looting random boxes around the sea and pirate hunting.\n\nControlling your ship can be done via WASD or even just the mouse. Since the basic attack are triggered automatically, you will spend most of the time trying to use your skills in the best way possible and avoiding the other ships attacks that have the same attacks and skills as you.\n\nThere isn't a story in game or any end goal set, other than getting max level if you want. Most quests are considered basic even to a 2015 game: fetch quests, hunt a enemy, defend a city. You can create, in the server that you are connected, 3 types of instances of a quick map that does not interfere with the global map and you may invite other players that are in the server as well to your instance. Your ship have 5 customizable color parts: two for the sails, two for the hull/ship and a emblem, the only thing is that you have to find other colors/emblem as loot.\n\nHighly recommend playing in coop since the game loop is rather short so having other players/friends with you make a better experience. You can join public servers or create you own (P2P or dedicated). The one issue that happened to me was that trying to create a P2P server I was not able to let other players join and there is an issue with dedicated server that it does not have a password system and setting it to not show on the master server I could not join it. But due to a lack of players playing this game, at most I had two other players in my server, having a \"private\" game is not a issue.\n\nAfter around 50-60 hours of gameplay, I was able to get all the achievements using the default game settings. You can change the game parameters to allow faster experience gain and combat difficult in your server/world. The only thing that I never saw was a couple of events that needs more players to trigger, not even as the server admin I was able to summon a couple enemies/events to check how they are in game. Also is possible to add custom emblems to you server.\n\nMusic could only be described as the most basic music set possible to a pirate game. Outside of combat, the little music that the game have did make me drowsy quickly, so I had to mute it and play other music that I have of my choice.\n\nBy the time of this review, I am on level 90 but I am aware that there is a little bit more content above level 100 to 150, max level being 750 I think. This is important because if you connect to a server or let your server open to anyone, someone may connect to your server using few ships that I would consider a spoiler for newer players.\n\nI can recommend this game for players wanting a simple light hearted MMORPG naval game when played with friends.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1736802040, "timestamp_updated": 1736802040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185492579": {"recommendationid": "185492579", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132936826", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1572, "playtime_at_review": 2706, "last_played": 1737282209}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ece\u5feb\u73a9\u8865\u7968\u8fc7\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u4fbf\u5b9c\u53c8\u597d\u73a9\u3002\u5f00\u59cb\u559c\u6b22\u73a9\u8d38\u6613\u8239\u961f\uff0c\u5230\u5904\u505a\u4e70\u5356\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5149\u987e\u7740\u73a9\u65e0\u754f\u8230\u961f\u548c\u6d77\u76d7\u5e72\u67b6\u4e86\u3002\u8638\u8c46\uff0c\u723d\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1736745769, "timestamp_updated": 1736745769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185137366": {"recommendationid": "185137366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043597624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1727132633}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was alright, didnt really pull me in.", "timestamp_created": 1736370494, "timestamp_updated": 1736370494, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185042696": {"recommendationid": "185042696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116215577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1076, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1736505631}, "language": "english", "review": "Its ok", "timestamp_created": 1736277275, "timestamp_updated": 1736277275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184030895": {"recommendationid": "184030895", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976311793", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 2125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2100, "last_played": 1735501837}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1735420956, "timestamp_updated": 1735420956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183871834": {"recommendationid": "183871834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155103384", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1735804724}, "language": "english", "review": "simple and grind-y, but you can spend a few fun hours.", "timestamp_created": 1735302456, "timestamp_updated": 1735302456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 2858, "total_negative": 711, "total_reviews": 3569}, "cursors": {"AoJ48rnr2oUDeuSt8wM=": "Mon Jan 20 18:00:42 2025"}}
