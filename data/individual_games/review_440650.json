It is very much a 'create your own fun' sort of game, rather than having definite goal. However, it feels more like a well polished demo than a full release, and seems to completely overestimate its depth (particularly in Story Mode). The genetics system is quite basic, and you can see every gene your creatures have (unless you're in sandbox and disable it). Mutations are based solely on player input rather than occurring naturally. For a game in which the physical traits of the creatures is the main focus, the creature models are quite underwhelming, even considering the graphical style of the game. If this game had mod support or still received updates I think it would be much easier to recommend it at full price, but it has neither of those things.\n\nStory Mode\nStory mode is intended to be a sort of tutorial for new players. The (unskippable) tutorial does a good job of explaining the game, but really didn't need a whole game mode for it. This game mode has several genetic mutations unique to it (I *think* you can get the same genes in sandbox, just not as mutations). Which is a bit of an issue if you want to complete everything in a sandbox world. There are two main goals: get home, and keep a certain gene in your creatures the whole while. The game does not explain how to get home, and it does not point out the unique gene or its significance. I believe the intended way to play is to move to each new island, completely conquer it while adapting your creatures to it, and then move on to do the same to the next island (which you've probably chosen at random). If you choose to play that way, even if you know the fastest path home, don't die and restart, don't lose the special gene and restart - you're going to be spending many hours playing this way. Far too many for what this game has to offer. And you *are* going to die, and you *are* going to lose the gene, potentially *many* hours in to a run. And once you 'win', you get to keep doing what you've been doing this entire time, minus the stress of the special gene. There is also zero customization to this game mode's settings unless you want to use console commands.\n\nSandbox Mode\nSandbox Mode really illustrates the lack of features and depth of the features the game does have. You can customize what type of island you start on, the genes of your starting creatures, their lifespans, and the resources/animals that spawn. Most of these are an on/off switch, or a slider with a too limited range. A win condition can be set, but your options are very limited. Despite being the 'main' game mode, you are unable to get several mutations (locked behind story mode). Meaning you need to find outsider creatures that have those genes (if that is possible, I'm not sure), and invite them to your tribe. If you wanted to 100% the mutations menu, you're going to have to play Story Mode. I mentioned above that this is a 'make your own fun' game, but Sandbox really doesn't give you the options to make your world just as you want it.\n\nApplying to both of the gamemodes \nIt just gets repetitive and boring. Pick food, cut grass, breed, maybe move to another island that may or may not be mostly indistinguishable, die, repeat. And very little other than the breeding is interesting. Even that is shallow - choose two creatures with the traits you want, and if you don't want the baby, drown it. The genetics and mutation menus look a lot more complicated that they really are. As for food: gathering from anything is about the same. It's all about what your creature can gather, not its diet. Hunting is time-consuming and just not worth it unless you have extra creatures with good attack. Predators are dangerous, but you can just run away (or hide, if you clicked the appropriate colors and patterns in the mutation menu and got it to pass down). Moving to another island is risky, and often leads to undesirable creatures staying by berry bushing and harvesting them while everyone else travels. This gets old very quickly. The islands are also pretty bland. Other than a few different creatures and plants, they're mostly the same. Sometimes almost identical. \n\nAnother review said this as well, but: Look at the screenshots. That's what you're playing. That's not a part of the game, that's pretty much all of it. What you see is what you get.\n\nDespite all I've said above, I had some fun with it. I might go back to it in the future, but I doubt my thoughts will change on it. The creatures are interesting and cute, and while the gameplay isn't too complex, it can be punishing if you are unaware of the dangers, take too many risks, or are just unprepared. I haven't run into any bugs, and the game runs smoothly. Once you've figured out the interface, it's quite easy to use.

All you do is manage the lifespan of your creatures, how many there are in your genetic pool, how much food you got and who to mate with whom. \n\nThe limited amount of carnivores, critters and animals in general makes the game feel pretty empty, the animal kingdom also got way more to offer. Whenever the game is turn based with very limited combat options it gets quite repetitive. The UI, HUD game and art design and overall gameplay makes it feel like it's somewhat shallow and still in early access. Like the entire focus was on the genetics which makes everything around it feel pretty shallow and empty.\n\nI can see where a bunch of people enjoy this game, I've also put a bunch of hours into \"Spore\" back in the days.
