You're a mining company competing with other mining companies by selling goods to a space colony. Each mining company has unique advantages and disadvantages that requires you to make some interesting choices when setting up your operation. There is also an active market for the resources you are mining and goods that are manufactured. Prices fluctuate based on colony demand and the supply of goods. \n\nThe early game has you deciding which resources to go for first as you're competing for plots of land with the other mining companies. As the game progresses, you may continue to mine for more resources, but have to balance that with power, water, food, and profitable manufactured goods. The number of land claims granted to you is limited, so you have to choose wisely. You'll need to wait until your headquarters is upgraded before your claim limit is increased. Or, if it comes up, you can try your luck at purchasing a new claim through auction.\n\nIn single player campaign, goods and resources can be used to build buildings for the colony, getting you points. In skirmishes, they're sold so you can begin to buy out the other mining companies with the objective of becoming the last mining company standing.\n\nThere is also a \"take that\" element in the form of a black market. These are special actions you (or your opponents!) can pay for that either give you a boost, or cripple some function of the competing mining company. It can get pretty hostile! You can also upgrade your production, manipulate market prices, and patent special abilities that only you can use.\n\nIts a fast paced game that requires some planning. I use the pause function a lot to stop the action and game plan. Usually claiming my plots and taking actions while the game is in pause. Then letting it run and see how it goes. There is a learning curve here, but I didn't find it too complicated. After playing through the tutorials and failing miserably my first few rounds, I got the idea and began to play much better. The good part about it is the games are quick. This isn't a multi-hour, 4x type of strategy. So if you blow it big time, its not a lot of time lost and you can jump right into a new round.\n\nI'd recommend this for someone who likes some light economic strategy, quick matches, and some \"take that\" action sprinkled in.", "timestamp_created": 1736044715, "timestamp_updated": 1736046296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184784928": {"recommendationid": "184784928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994032932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1736031958}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent 7 hours trying to beat the AI.
