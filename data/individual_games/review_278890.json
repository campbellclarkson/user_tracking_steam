"review": "Rating: 6/10\nSummary: A fun little Rogue-like platformer with decent replayability, unfortunately let down at times by some frustrating mechanics and the bad kind of 'random'.\n\nOn the surface, Angvik offers 6 classes. However, for 5 of them the only difference is your starting equipment, and given this may only last you the first level or two, the gameplay is essentially identical for these classes (starting gear matters more on harder difficulties... more on that in a sec). The final class is the Peasant class, which is essentially a no-hit run... fortunately I enjoy this kind of challenge once I get familiar with a game, but if you're not one of these people then heed this warning. You're never forced to play any particular class, so you can avoid Peasant unless you're trying for 100% completion.\n\nThere are [spoiler]6[/spoiler] levels in total. Level layout doesn't change from run to run, so with time you'll become quite slick at navigating the terrain with ease, which is quite satisfying. The experience is kept fresh by randomised enemy placement, and the ever-present gaming trope of finding decent loot for that good ol' dopamine hit. With time, you'll realise that some weapons and oils are significantly more useful than others, but there's nothing too wrong with that ([spoiler]Boomerangs + Red/Gold Oil = win game[/spoiler])\n\nSo what lets this game down? Firstly, enemy placement can sometimes feel like it's done deliberately to frustrate the player, and at times, can even create nigh-impassable situations unless you've found/kept the right gear (remember, besides starting equipment, this will all be RNG). Secondly, there's some bad uses of randomness present in this game. Random mechanics are often subtly done so well in other brutal platform games such as Spelunky or Hollow Knight, that you may not even appreciate what makes these mechanics fair, and therefore, fun. Enemies with different moves/attacks that they can choose between is a good thing, but if there's no tell for the player (even just a split second frame), then suddenly it's just unfair and frustrating. For example, the pink birds on level 2 floating over the spikes will occasionally wind up their charge [i]much[/i] quicker than usual, causing you to miss the stomp and fall into the spikes, usually ending your run. There's no tell for when they do this, so it's plain unfair. Then there are others that change direction without warning, or vary time between attacks. These may sound like minor gripes, but in a game literally built around muscle-memory and pattern-recognition to hone skill through repeated plays, [b]it matters[/b].\n\nOh, and a final example on concealed randomness sapping a bit of fun... to progress through the game you need to select the class 'Great Guy', which essentially gives you a \"random\" class on difficulty 1. Beat difficulty 1, and you'll unlock difficulty 2 etc. Don't like the class it gave you? Quit and restart to get a new one - it takes 2 seconds. So where's the catch? Well, by the time you get to the 5th and final difficulty, the only classes the game ever gives you is Shepherd, Bottler and Peasant. We've already discussed how Peasant is a no-hit run and therefore objectively the worst, so if it selects Peasant on the hardest difficulty then that's an instant restart. You'll spend the vast majority of your time in this game trying to beat difficulties 4 and 5, so yeah - you'll basically only play with 2 classes for most of your playtime, and of course, their starting gear is the worst of the lot. Just what you want when the first level on difficulty 5 is essentially bullet hell! Allowing all 6 classes throughout the difficulties would have provided a much more fun, varied experience, whilst barely making the game any easier.\n\nAll this said, overall I have enjoyed my time with Angvik, and beating Peasant and 5-Star runs was very satisfying. If you're a fan of games like Spelunky and Rouge Legacy and their sequels and don't mind a challenge, then do I recommend that you check this out.", "timestamp_created": 1735914416, "timestamp_updated": 1736244494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550172984600067139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184412524": {"recommendationid": "184412524", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079430426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "playtime_at_review": 1959, "last_played": 1737192944}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uaf2d \ucc0d\uc5b4\uba39\uc5b4\ubcf4\uc138\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1735723810, "timestamp_updated": 1735723810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184407790": {"recommendationid": "184407790", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001461192", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1736253342}, "language": "english", "review": "ddddd", "timestamp_created": 1735718939, "timestamp_updated": 1735718939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184257416": {"recommendationid": "184257416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840439435", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1025, "last_played": 1702192892}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "timestamp_created": 1735593794, "timestamp_updated": 1735593794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183962275": {"recommendationid": "183962275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369231203", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1711115578}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc12d\ucde8\ub2f9\ud55c \uc138\uc6d4", "timestamp_created": 1735371863, "timestamp_updated": 1735371863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183961988": {"recommendationid": "183961988", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198095301", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 721, "last_played": 1735440462}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\uc9c1\ub3c4 5\uc131 \ubabb\uae78 \u314b\u314b\u3160", "timestamp_created": 1735371593, "timestamp_updated": 1735371593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 2181, "total_negative": 310, "total_reviews": 2491}, "cursors": {"AoJw7fDviIYDf5Pg9wM=": "Mon Jan 20 17:24:09 2025"}}
