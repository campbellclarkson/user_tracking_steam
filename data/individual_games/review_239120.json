But I strongly recommend playing literally any other version of FF3 over this Steam port. \r\n\r\nThis Steam port is a catastrophe for two main reasons. Most importantly because the save system is fucked up but also because it (like the PSP version) is a port of the phone version which has shitty UI, radically worse music than the DS (the other versions might have uncompressed audio but the DS's OST had a deeper pitch and packed more of a punch) and treats the player like a three year old with the \"!\" marks telling you that you can open chests or that you're close enough to NPCs to talk to them. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate the auto battle feature (which still doesn't stop job level grinding from being a chore) and the Mognet sidequests being available without online multiplayer but it's just not enough. \r\n\r\nFor some braindead reason when you boot up the game and get to the main menu the first option is \"Continue\" instead of \"Load Game\". I can only assume this is like a save state on an emulator because I accidentally pressed Continue when mashing the A button trying to get it to hurry up and skip past the logo and instantly my save file went back in time almost ten hours. There was no chance of just going back to the main menu and loading my real save because everything got overwritten. \r\n\r\nThat's unacceptable period but it's a million times worse for a game that is as ball numbingly tedious as the FF3 remake is. \r\n\r\nSee, the main problem with the 3D remake is that you're weak and useless if you don't spend forever grinding out Job Levels and Final Fantasy III regardless of the version is built around you constantly changing Jobs. \r\n\r\nAlso apparently this port has several other crazy bugs but I didn't see anything like that and I won't be playing any farther to see if I do. \r\n\r\nSave yourself and play any other version of FF3, or even better play another game entirely.
