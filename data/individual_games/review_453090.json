But it turns out this is my favourite theme park sim, and it's because for the first time in the genre, building is so easy, satisfying and visually tactile that it's like playing with interactive Legos.\r\n\r\nPutting down other people's blueprints for rides or buildings feels like you're looking into a ornate and beautifully realized toy diorama that you get to endlessly tinker and edit with, and even though the prop item UI is clumsy, the pipette tool lets you directly clone anything in the world and sidestep that entirely, keeping your focus on the world, and I've found that placing someone else's blueprint acts like a painting palette you get to sample and expand on.\r\n\r\nThe edits and tweaks it makes to the classic theme park formula are also all smart ones, having to care about cargo distribution means that for the first time you're making functional backlots to a theme park, and the requirement to keep them out of sight of guests means that your theming and d\u00e9cor are being used for an additional functional purpose other than to please guests (and yourself), and it makes that interactive diorama aesthetic all the more satisfying to watch these two halves exist simultaneously.  It also reveals just how half-baked and unfinished Planet Coaster 2's anemic changes to their management system really is.\r\n\r\nFull multiplayer support is delightful (even custom music syncing if everyone has the same music files!) as is the robust workshop and modding support, which even though it appears like activity peaked a while ago, still has a lot to offer with extra rides and props.  \r\n\r\nMy complaints with this game end up being pretty minor, I can only think of three things of note:\r\n\r\n- The UI is \"fine\" but not good, the layouts and use of color are awkward and the prop menu lacks favourites and useful categorization features.\r\n- While most of the visuals have this nice chunky toy-like aesthetic, the guests look like someone's first Blender modelling project and I wish they complimented everything else.\r\n- There's no undo/redo. While it gets easier over time it never stops feeling absent.\r\n\r\nThis is the first theme park where theming and decoration felt fun, and I reckon that even if you're not into management sims this game could be recommended to anyone looking to express themselves creatively or wanting to tinker with a relaxing digital toy.", "timestamp_created": 1735462226, "timestamp_updated": 1735462226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184075341": {"recommendationid": "184075341", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993209165", "num_games_owned": 10589, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1731810132}, "language": "english", "review": "Tutorial is bad.
