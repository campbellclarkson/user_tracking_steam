Any actions done by the player are NOT buffered so you either be frame perfect or your action will not be executed. (Using sprite abilities are a pain since you can't do them while attacking. You HAVE to wait until your attack is finished.)\r\n\r\n* Bad aiming system: It is impossible to aim at small enemies or the blue healing bats. If I put my mouse cursor on the enemy while both of us are standing still, the attack should hit the enemy, not go above it.\r\n\r\n* Weapons are too risky: Everything in this game 3 hit kills you. There are not enough healing sources in game. Swords are too risky, Bombs are too unpredictable, guns have the aim problem mentioned before.\r\n\r\n* Dodging has no use when cornered. The smallest enemy will stop you in your tracks if you attempt to doge. This only leaves the sheild bash which knocks enemies into the area where your bash stops, making it useless here too.\r\n\r\nThere are other balancing issues which can be written off due to this being a \"difficult\" game.\r\n\r\nI hope the developers can get arround to fixing these issues, although nothing of note \"gameplay wise\" happened in the past 2 years.
