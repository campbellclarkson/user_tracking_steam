Just got banned by server admins for no reason whatsoever. Honestly, if you like a community that absolutely craps on it's fans then this is the place for you. Literally most if not all of the admins will ban or kick you without conclusive evidence. Admins used to be held accountable, now they just do what they want and play map rotations they wanna play despite the whole server asking for a different rotation. Oh and don't forget if your mic is broken and you didn't type anything in chat you can still get banned :).\n\nI've had this game for a year and the experiences are utterly incomparable to what it was before I quit playing. To the MODs/Admins fix yourselves, your game is dying because of you. You don't need to control every human being in the server let alone just ban random people. To the devs from a business standpoint I would highly advise you to keep the MODs/Admins in check. It's disgusting the amount of favoritism shown in this game. Admins will literally ignore racist comments from friends and ban others for doing it, which shouldn't be happening. \n\nTo finalize my thoughts on this game, the game play itself is not an issue, it's just the community. The community is drowning this game and running it into the ground. It's basically if you don't agree with how I feel or do what I say and I have power over you I'm gonna ban or TK you. It is unreal how bad this community is. There is so obviously an inner circle that's virtually a cancer eating a way at this community.\n\n\nUpdate: I tried to appeal my ban and the admins with zero proof told me they didn't believe me and then began to make smart ass remarks towards me. How is this in anyway acceptable. They tried forcing me to tell them that I said it when I didn't. And when I told them no I'm not telling you I said that because guess what shit for brains I didn't say it. And then furthermore they began to make fun of officers in public matches.\n\nDidn't do it mics broken, would've owned up to it had I done it. I wouldn't have made this big a deal about it had I done it. I was in a large company in a big crowd so very well coulda been someone else. Forcing someone to try and own up to something they didn't do is fucking vile, and I don't disagree with you agrippa. But, the fact of the matter is I got screwed by whoever banned me without any context or any reasoning as to why I was banned. And when I told you this you guys virtually told me my side of the story is shit and does not matter. and it's not a few hours either, 6 hours is a lot of time when you work almost everyday of the week. I do not care if you bash me publicly. People buying this shit need to know the fuckery they are getting themselves into. They need to know that they can just get banned without doing anything. I'm not the first to complain about this and obviously, because you guys suck as mods I won't be the last.

This is not the kind of game that requires hours of gameplay to understand or dive into a meaningful story. I don\u2019t often leave reviews, but this game truly deserves to be called out. War of Rights is one of the most frustrating and disappointing experiences I\u2019ve had in recent gaming history, and I genuinely regret spending both my time and money on it.\n\nFirst off, the community is absolutely toxic. I\u2019ve never encountered a game with such a high concentration of racist comments and offensive behavior. The player base is filled with vile individuals who don\u2019t hesitate to make the experience unbearable with their hate speech and disgusting remarks. It\u2019s enough to make you want to quit immediately.\n\nBut it gets worse. The so-called \"experienced\" players are incredibly entitled and rude. If you don\u2019t play the game exactly how they want you to, they\u2019ll verbally attack you, demand you follow their orders, or even kick you from the game. There\u2019s no room for individual playstyles, and if you\u2019re new, be prepared to get bullied by these \"veterans.\"\n\nThe gameplay in War of Rights is painfully slow-paced and rooted in \"realism\"\u2014which sounds great in theory but is tedious in practice. Reloading your weapon takes forever, mirroring the long, grueling process of the Civil War era, and running drains your stamina at an alarming rate, making it feel like you're trudging through mud. If you're not in \"formation,\" you're penalized, which restricts your freedom and adds unnecessary pressure to an already frustrating experience. Defending yourself against stabs or close combat is nearly impossible, and the difficulty of distinguishing friend from foe in the chaotic battlefield only adds to the confusion. The objectives are poorly explained, often obscure, and frankly, boring, making it feel more like a slog than a meaningful battle.\n\nThen there\u2019s the technical side of things. No matter how powerful your PC or fast your internet speed is, War of Rights is an absolute lag-fest. I can barely play without constant stuttering and delay, even with top-tier specs and the best connection money can buy. It feels like the game was made for hardware from 2000, not something capable of handling modern titles.\n\nTo top it off, there is only ONE active PUG server, and it\u2019s filled with trolls. These players think it\u2019s hilarious to team-kill, ruin the game for everyone, and generally destroy any chance of having a fun experience. It\u2019s the same toxic group of players over and over again, and the server is hardly ever populated with anyone else. The game is essentially dead, with no active community to support it.\n\nIn short, War of Rights is a mess\u2014the gameplay, the community, and the technical performance are all subpar. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one entirely. There are far better games out there that don\u2019t come with a racist community and toxic leadership demanding you worship them.
