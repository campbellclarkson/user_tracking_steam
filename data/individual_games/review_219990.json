I can just barely see the menu to adjust this. I have to squint my eyes a foot away from the screen to see the menu. I adjusted it to 4k and it messed up the colors on my screen so badly I had to restart my PC to correct it. It didn't even change the scale of the UI. I adjust the UI scaler in the same menu and this did absolutely nothing as if it is just a slider and no code behind it. I then tried to scale the resolution down to 1080p and it made the screen so small I could no longer see any aspect of the game. It even minimized the window to 25% of my screen and I could not adjust this to full screen again. The scaling also effects where you have to click on screen for the menus so if it's scaled incorrectly in any way the menu becomes a nightmare to navigate because the trigger for your mouse is now offset somewhere else on screen. So I got out my controller because surely the d-pad is mapped correctly to the menu options... Nope. For some reason the menu navigation is also not adjusted to the controller when the screen is at a resolution the game doesn't like. The d-pad just moves the actual mouse cursor to the menu option and as I established before the resolution offsets the clicking trigger event. I cannot even set the screen resolution without significant issues. I'm not entirely certain why this is happening even though I have a suspicion why but I'm not going to take time troubleshooting this. I've never seen a game that has this much trouble with resolution scaling and I've certainly never seen a developer code the triggers for the menu not binded to the buttons themselves. This means the developer placed the onClick() event on an actual hard coded xy value that overlaps the menu button which will offset when the resolution is adjusted rather then bind it to the menu button location on screen. If I'm seeing this type of issues and I haven't even made it in game yet... Nah. It's refund time.\n\nI'm not going to waste my time with this game when I'm having problems just getting out of the damn main menu.\n\nEdit: Look at the forums for this game or just comments under both positive and negative reviews. This is one of the most toxic communities out there. Lmao. Sorry people have legitimate issues with your favorite game. I'll never understand the type of internet trolls who just scour all comments about a game they chose to defend to the death and ignore legitimate issues.

Ich habe viel Diablo 1,2 & 4 gezockt, in Path Of Exile habe ich was-wei\u00df-ich-wieviele Stunden versenkt - kurz: ich liebe ARPGs. Doch lange Zeit habe ich Grim Dawn links liegen gelassen. Was ich heute bereue! \r\n\r\nHabe jetzt in 26h die Kampagne das erste Mal durchgespielt. Hat echt viel Spa\u00df gemacht, das Design der Welt ist gut gelungen, auch wenn es keine Open World ist. \r\nAnfangs fand ich die vielen Affixe der Items etwas verwirrend, doch wenn man etwas Erfahrung mit dem Genre hat findet man sich schnell zurecht. Auf den ersten Blick gibt es nicht viele Skills, doch dieser Eindruck t\u00e4uscht gewaltig. Denn Grim Dawn geht bei der Charakter-Entwicklung eher in Richtung Path Of Exile. Aber keine Angst, man wird hier nicht mit einem mehrere Screens f\u00fcllendem Talent-Baum erschlagen! \r\nStattdessen w\u00e4hlt man bei Erreichen von Level 2 seine erste Klasse. Erreicht man Level 10, w\u00e4hlt man eine zweite Klasse, die Kombination dieser zwei Klassen ergibt dann die eigentliche Klasse. Ich habe beispielsweise Arcanist und Occultist genommen, diese beiden Klassen wurden dann zum Warlock. \r\nMit den beiden DLCs gibt es neun Klassen, die man beliebig miteinander kombinieren kann. Unterm Strich ergibt das eine h\u00fcbsche Vielfalt an spielbaren Klassen. Geskillt werden dann jeweils die Skill Trees der jeweiligen Klasse. \r\nDazu gibt es noch einen dritten Skill Tree um euren Build je nach Geschmack zu skillen, den Devotion Tree. Verteilt in der gesamten Welt findet man Devotion Schreine, die euch je einen Punkt geben. Der Devotion Tree gibt verschiedene Boni auf eure Attribute, dazu kann man einzelne Skills mit einem zus\u00e4tzlichen Effekt ausstatten. \r\nZugegeben, das klingt alles nach viel, ist in der Praxis aber ziemlich intuitiv. Und hat man einen Fehler gemacht und merkt, da\u00df die aktuelle Skillung nicht wie gew\u00fcnscht funktioniert, kann man in der Stadt jederzeit gegen einen (sehr) kleinen Preis seine Punkte umverteilen. \r\n\r\nGrim Dawn generiert eine sch\u00f6n d\u00fcstere Atmosph\u00e4re und spielt sich fl\u00fcssig. Wer ARPGs mag kann hier guten Gewissens zugreifen.", "timestamp_created": 1737124759, "timestamp_updated": 1737124759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185785054": {"recommendationid": "185785054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219903816", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 772, "playtime_at_review": 1154, "last_played": 1737125523}, "language": "schinese", "review": "6", "timestamp_created": 1737124669, "timestamp_updated": 1737124669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185783475": {"recommendationid": "185783475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406698096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1737207240}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc624\ub798\ub41c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub514\uc544\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1737123094, "timestamp_updated": 1737123094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185777446": {"recommendationid": "185777446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312598945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2469, "playtime_at_review": 34662, "last_played": 1737304064}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521a\u5165\u95e8", "timestamp_created": 1737116459, "timestamp_updated": 1737116459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185775720": {"recommendationid": "185775720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284932087", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2359, "playtime_at_review": 3654, "last_played": 1737296175}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7279\u522b\u4e0a\u5934", "timestamp_created": 1737114187, "timestamp_updated": 1737114187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185775542": {"recommendationid": "185775542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413091943", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1435, "playtime_at_review": 11566, "last_played": 1737336480}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bd4\u6697\u9ed1\u597d\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u95e8\u69db\u4f4e\uff0c\u6697\u9ed1\u592a\u72d7\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1737113944, "timestamp_updated": 1737113944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185767381": {"recommendationid": "185767381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322759312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4269, "playtime_at_review": 4070, "last_played": 1737236151}, "language": "english", "review": "ebola build", "timestamp_created": 1737101258, "timestamp_updated": 1737101258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185767165": {"recommendationid": "185767165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061054939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2635, "playtime_at_review": 2689, "last_played": 1737136341}, "language": "greek", "review": "Hello all!\r\nI have played a lot of ARPG in general even back in 90s at the start of Diablo 1, i tried the game with a lot of caution because it was not so appealing to me....BUT after finishing the main story of the core game without the expansions i have to say that i can not get enough!

Nem mesmo a Blizzard conseguiu entregar um ARPG \u00e0 altura desde os cl\u00e1ssicos Diablo 1 e 2. Dentre os v\u00e1rios pontos de destaque de Grim Dawn, eu consigo citar os seguintes:\n- O sistema de combina\u00e7\u00e3o de classes \u00e9 bem diferente, voc\u00ea tem ali (considerando as DLC's) 9 classes base, e podendo realizar a combina\u00e7\u00e3o com mais uma classe, voc\u00ea tem a possibilidade de criar at\u00e9 44 classes;\n- Habilidades e poderes trazem peso e fluidez ao combate, fazendo com que cada encontro seja satisfat\u00f3rio.\n- A atmosfera sombria, aliada a uma narrativa rica e bem constru\u00edda, me manteve engajado e curioso sobre o desfecho da hist\u00f3ria.\n- Conte\u00fado de Endgame: Repleto de desafios, dungeons, fac\u00e7\u00f5es e atividades para explorar, garantindo horas de divers\u00e3o mesmo ap\u00f3s finalizar a campanha principal.\n- Suporte a Mods: A possibilidade de mods amplia ainda mais a rejogabilidade, permitindo aos f\u00e3s personalizar e expandir o jogo ao infinito.\n- A trilha sonora ambiente \u00e9 excelente e contribui muito para a atmosfera sombria do jogo, lembrando o estilo marcante de Diablo 2. \n- J\u00e1 a tem\u00e1tica se destaca por fugir do convencional entre os ARPGs, que geralmente exploram criaturas mitol\u00f3gicas, dem\u00f4nios e fantasia medieval. Grim Dawn aposta em uma ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o inspirada na era vitoriana, com inimigos interdimensionais devastando a humanidade \u2014 \u00e9 uma premissa inusitada, mas que traz uma originalidade bem-vinda. \n\nN\u00e3o posso deixar de elogiar o cuidado da Crate Entertainment com este jogo: sem monetiza\u00e7\u00e3o abusiva, passes ou qualquer outra pr\u00e1tica predat\u00f3ria, e ainda assim eles continuam atualizando o t\u00edtulo mesmo ap\u00f3s 8 anos de seu lan\u00e7amento.\n\nRecomendo.", "timestamp_created": 1736971933, "timestamp_updated": 1736971933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543859660625457764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185667481": {"recommendationid": "185667481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393434393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1113, "playtime_at_review": 2103, "last_played": 1736891039}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0456 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0454\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0456 \u044f\u043a\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0456\u043d Titan Quest, \u0437\u0456 \u0432\u0441\u0456\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0456 \u043c\u0456\u043d\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u043e. \r\n\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0456\u043a\u0430 -

First, I didn't know about it sooner and second it's going to be harder to get into other arpgs after playing this one because it's so good. A few things stand out to me in this game compared to other arpgs.\r\n\r\nThe early game doesn't feel like a slog. From the beginning of the game you pick up a skill and keep improving and refining your build until you become super powerful. The skills from early on feel good to use and you don't run out of mana/energy after two usages just because it's early game.\r\n\r\nExploration is encouraged especially in your first playthrough. You can discover shrines (which give devotion points and make your character stronger), you can open chests, find elites, story notes (which you can use to gain exp!) and even kill quest npcs or loot quest objects. The cool thing about this game is that if you kill an npc or loot a quest object before picking up the quest you can still hand in the quest the same the dialogue just changes. You never feel like you made the wrong decision or miss out on exp/loot regardless of the decisions you make. You're free to approach the game however you like.\r\n\r\nStory is very good for an arpg. The story is well developed and interesting which is surprising for this game genre as that's not usually the case.\r\n\r\nEasy to get into but still has a lot of depth. It feels easy and intuitive to figure out what items you need for your build but as you play you'll keep on finding more and more things to make your character stronger (skills, attributes, devotion points, relics and so much more!)\r\n\r\n10/10 game and would highly recommend.

Like Multi classing. that's pretty 'dope' in and of itself, but the act of doing so is a scam.\n\nLet me break it down, so you the reader can understand how amazing yet absolutely garbage this game is, because the devs thought it would be funny to not only have esoteric knowledge to understand the stats in this game, they also decided to troll you the player by having one of the stupidest systems ever conceived.\n\nSo every class has a discipline bar that requires points independent of your skills. the discipline bar is where a good 50% of your actual stats come from. this would not be a problem but it becomes a problem later in the game when you inevitably find out on a blind play through that multi classing will actually hurt you in the long run. Unless you have your build planned out you are inevitably going to hit a wall in terms of stat and gear progression. The BS starts around level 20 or 25 when you find out this games gear has item level garbage and expects you to gear climb to equip level appropriate items or use devotions that are completely unrelated to your build to \"fix\" the problems. Which I don't think I should have to tell you this, but if I have to have prior esoteric knowledge on your games inner working on normal mode, then your game is terrible. Because by the time I got to a spoiler location at level 40 and started looking at guides to figure out if I was doing something wrong and why I could not equip level appropriate gear. I realized I was doing everything wrong. but I am not taking the L for this games horrifying lack of conveyance because the devs want to be Diablo 3.1 the path of torchlight wild tangent edition. So low and behold I \"finished\" the game wearing gear that I was using at level 18 on normal+veteran.\n\n[h2]But wait! There is even more reason not to buy this game[/h2]\n\nwhen I was actually enjoying the game, up until Cronley, I suggested the game to someone else. Which led me to find out the game is on console, and that console version has a complete edition. It was 8USD. now lets do some basic math and check out the on sale prices of all the DLC plus base game on sale on steam. Well that is about 25 bucks, off sale each of those DLCs is about 17 bucks aside from the cosmetics, and the roguelike mode so realistically off sale it comes to about 70 USD if you want everything and on top of all of that the only way to fully respec your character is to own the expansions, yes I am not kidding you can respec your skills and nothing else in the base game so you can literally pay to unscrew your character if it is sincerely that bad. So knowing that I'm just going to say crate entertainment is a dev you probably should actively avoid if you care about consumer practices across platforms. which no one on steam really does but thats a different conversation.\n\n[h3]Finally[/h3]\n\nStory is fine, base UI is absolutely garbage, the controller support actually makes zero sense and led to an even worse play experience than the one I thought I was having on keyboard. If you're curious about it, buy it on deep sale, but if you have no intention of getting the dlc don't bother because apparently the dlc \"fixes\" most the problem but if you still decided to buy it on sale do a full uninstall at [spoiler]old arkovia[/spoiler] because that's where the fun stops. The devs are openly incompetent on the forums too, which I find pretty funny. I love how this developer made a post on the steam forums saying they didn't want to spend engineering time making something experimental and mediocre, when all grim dawn is, is an experimental and mediocre experience piggy backing on hundreds of ideas from games before it.\n\nThe game isn't terrible but it certainly isn't good either. I will continue playing it with friends, and that is quite frankly all I have to say about this game. Anything that I've described that is wrong, I will be blaming on bad conveyance from the game and its devs, because after 33 hours I am highly disappointed and from here on will be ignoring crate entertainment.", "timestamp_created": 1736915377, "timestamp_updated": 1736915990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.355516493320465088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185623747": {"recommendationid": "185623747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872478538", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2251, "playtime_at_review": 2059, "last_played": 1737290321}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \"Diablo 2\". \u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \"Diablo\" 3 \u0438 4, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0435. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0435: \u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441 2 \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0441 2 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438! \u041f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c 5 \u0413\u0431 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 Ryzen 3.", "timestamp_created": 1736914379, "timestamp_updated": 1736914379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185620365": {"recommendationid": "185620365", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104979676", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2779, "playtime_at_review": 947, "last_played": 1737307335}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u8d56", "timestamp_created": 1736909194, "timestamp_updated": 1736909194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185613332": {"recommendationid": "185613332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880746348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "playtime_at_review": 24274, "last_played": 1736911697}, "language": "english", "review": "UwU", "timestamp_created": 1736899358, "timestamp_updated": 1736899358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185611770": {"recommendationid": "185611770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305153414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 12036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12036, "last_played": 1658511520}, "language": "english", "review": "Panetti's has the replicating missiles if you have the time.

It is a very usual isometric view ARPG but one good thing about this is that, as compared to D4, this game has a much wider zoomed out view and I like it. \r\n\r\nI've approximately 120ish hours invested as of writing this review, the itemization in this game is also pretty easy to understand and the enhancing of gears' concept is also very easy to grasp. \r\n\r\nThe campaign itself is really really enormously huge and the game largely focused on the campaign mode itself. \r\n\r\nThe gear system comprises of mainly the normal white, rare green, epic blue and lastly purple legendary/unique. The uniques are similar to that of D2 game, you can find same pieces of unique but they can have different roll in their stats just like a 120def shako vs a 141 perfect shako defense. All in all, the game is really well developed. Gameplay is smooth, graphic could be slightly outdated but it still look really really well. \r\n\r\nThe only downside or complain that I have for this game is that, in some zones, the terrain could be horrendously hard to navigate around.

You can get points by leveling up and with these points, you can learn or upgrade your skills. Just like the old times in Diablo or even Baldurs Gate. Also you can make a devoution build, that gives you extra stats and extra abilities for your skills.\n\n[h1] Many Classes but...[/h1]\nYeah there are a lot of classes like Warrior, Assassin, Range and several types of Magican (Arkane, Oculist etc.).\nI like this kinda stuff and you can even choose a second class after a time but the problem I have is ... many classes doesn't have a good counterpart like Assassin. I mean he is fighting with dual blades and you can build up a second build for your char but it's not very much possible because you don't get that much of points and shriens for your devotion stuff.\nAnd about getting good stuff... we will come to that later.\n\n[h1]Building your character is something else![/h1]\nIt's weird to complaing about too much gameplay stuff!\nIt isn't even about the story or the Map, this is totaly fine and well made, but let me tell you something about: \"It is hard to build a second build!\" and their comes my \"it's to fricking much!\".\nIt's cool that you can completely build free like whatever you want, but you losing yourself in it too fast. \nTheir are like 20 different builds in Devoution and the skilltree for your classes are way to expensive. \nAt the beginning your skills are not strong enought and if they are, they are getting outclassed.\nTo find out, what fits great to your build, you are spending about 2 hours maybe and for me, it's not worth it.\n\n[h1]Getting a shiney Pokemon is more likely than getting good stuff[/h1]\nI don't know if I have just the worst luck in this game, but the drop rate is something else!\nIt's damn hard to get a good, usable weapon or armor peace in this game and it is damn frustrating mostly because the enemy are getting harder and farming the enemies because of getting stuff and not even because of leveling is a bit weird and if you getting stuff for your level, it's often worse than the stuff you already have.\nAnd some of these armor pieces are a wall of text that is just painfull to read \n(Yeah I know I have some kind of allergic reaction to reading or whatever xD).\n\n[h1]You can suffer in Coop[/h1]\nYeah ok, suffering is not the right word and makes pretty much fun playing this with a friend.\nTheir can be some lags (that even can kill you in game) and I have sometimes a random blackscreen and game crashes but still it is fun to play. \nAlso if you die in a special dungeon in coop, you can't join this dungeon anymore and your friend is on his own in this dungeon.\n\n[h1]My Opinion about this[/h1]\nHard to tell and there is DLC stuff as well which I will (probably) never play.\nAll at all it is a very fun game to play in your free time but still I need to say that you will need to spend much time building your char to even have a chance against your enemy. There's also a story, but I pretty much lost track of it and didn't pay much attention to it, sadly.\nSo would I recommend it?\nYes for people having definitly fun playing games like that and were fans from Diablo 1 to 3 and the old Baldur Gates.

Theres probably a weapon for it? Lol One thing I found Super badass to do in-game was weild a double barrel handgun with a shield and I don't even like using Pistols all that much in videogames but this game had me using Pistols paired with a shield or sometimes I just went full gunsliner and Duel wielded Pistols needless to say these devs made a boring weapon type actually fun to play with the enemies and Bosses are done incredibly well too! Lots of mob verities so nothing gets boring fighting the same thing over n over again and not too mention also the death and gore mechanics are great of its time plenty of zombies and stuff can get cut in half and dismembered there's blood and guts everywhere in this game i think its awesome and fun! but don't friet there's an option to turn blood and gore off completely just incase some people out there don't have the stomach for it and or if kids end up playing this game it's a good game design choice done well by the devs I think and lastly I think I'll go over what I think of the graphics now now it certainly seems and feels more like Diablo 3 graphics but they just did the dark and Gothic medieval tone so much better for me personally the 3D models and stuff look exactly like diablo 3 but just not as cartoony it definitely has the better Grim! tone to it ;)", "timestamp_created": 1736622000, "timestamp_updated": 1736622000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502304136753082275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185373425": {"recommendationid": "185373425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299764543", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1469, "last_played": 1698761563}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1736621520, "timestamp_updated": 1736621520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185372658": {"recommendationid": "185372658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129695082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2560, "playtime_at_review": 1596, "last_played": 1737239514}, "language": "english", "review": "The king of single player ARPG's.

Sometimes you'll find a shrine, which require currency to use, and that's it. So you go in, clear mobs, and go to another map. Also there are no drops in SR, you'll get items only at the end in reward room.\n\nI hated arena in Last Epoch and here in GD Crucible Arena is no different, I just think this is boring, but maybe some like this type of content.\n\nSome poeple say there are Nemesis Bosses and Totems to do in endgame, but there is really no point of doing nemesis unsless you need their specific MI (unique rare items, that can have also random affixes), Totems on the other hand are great for getting item recipes, but they are also pretty repetitive.\n\nYou might think: wait, this endgame is very similiar to what Diablo 2 had, and it was pretty decent game. Well, yes, Diablo 2 had an open endgame, where there was no specified place to farm. The difference between endgames in D2 and GD is that in Diablo 2 you actally had something to grind for. It could be super rare uniques, not always useful in builds, but really satisfying to find or you could find really rare runes, used to create powerful Runewords.\nSo my problem with Grim Dawn is that, there is nothing to grind for really, you'll never be excited about a random, unexpected drop when farming, especially after they changed one thing in 1.2 version, that makes bosses always drop their MI. How can I be excited about drop that I know I will find and how can I be excited about running the same map layout for 100th time, looking for a perfect set of affixes?\n\nThe maps in Grim Dawn are not procedurally generated, so you'll be running the same maps all the time you want to farm specific item, and all the time you create new character. One of the pillars of Hack and Slash games are randomly generated maps, and Grim Dawn is definitely not standing on that pillar, so it's not a H&S, it's an RPG game with H&S elements.\n\nI really dislike item progression in this game. First you are introduced to normal and magic items, which become irrelevant after 10 minutes of gameplay, so you can uncheck them in filter. I really think that's a waste comparing to D2 and PoE, where even white and magic items matters in crafting.\nNext you'll be equiping rare items, and then switch to Legendaries with maybe 1 or 2 Monster Infrequents, depends on the build. You skip Blue (Epic) items, they are useless anyway.\nMy problem with Legendaries: they are boring, very boring, because they are just normal items with bumped up stats, and sometimes set bonuses. Also get used to set bonuses, game is literally forcing you to play specific set and specific skills, like in Diablo 3, leaving very little freedom for theorycrafting builds. From Uniques and Legendary items I expect them to be interesting, have UNIQUE stats that will allow crazy builds, and i expect some of them to be really rare to find, in GD i didn't found any of those aspects of items.\n\nNobody's gonna negate that PoE did it's best job in creating interesting items. There are many uniques, and even modifiers on rare items, that will enable new builds. Such as Mana stacker, giving you bonuses depending on your mana pool. Attribute stackers, where you try to max out attributes on your gear to reach new highs. Even simple +2 to projectile count is very satisfying upgrade to your character.\nSo that's why I'm dissapointed in GD itemisation, there is nothing that compare to modifiers listed above.\n\nThe world scales up to your level. Basically nothing more to add to it, it's the bane upon all h&s games, where you should feel progress of your character, but in this game when you level up, and go back few zones, all monsters will be scaled up to your level, meaning they'll have higher defences, so I ask, where is satisfaction from leveling and upgrading, if a basic zombie mob can stand the same amount of hits no matter what your level is.\n\nFaction system. Again a mechanic that shouldn't be in h&s. The whole faction system in Grim Dawn exists just to hide from you augments that increase your resistances. Again I ask, where is satisfaction from getting that? Why those augments are not rare drops that you'll get only from Ultimate difficulty, so you can slowly but surely farm these and be more excited about upgrading your character towards endgame. There is just no fun in buying stuff from npc that will solve your resistance problem. Hack and Slash games should offer interesting problems that player have to solve, such as their resistanced, attributes. Unfortunetaly in GD you'll always have maxed out resists and there will be no time ever where you're missing some attributes to equip new gear.\n\nAlso, I've seen the devs want to make another tier of Rare items, because MI are too powerful, what's next? Super-omega Empowered Legendaries? If you have to make another tier of your item rarity, there is definitely something wrong with your itemisation system.\n\nBossfights are not memorable, after that many hour played I have no idea what are bosses names, I don't even know if they have unique voicelines. I think this is really important for boss to have their unique lines, like you hear it in PoE or D2, once heard you'll remember it for life.\n\nThere is a huge problem with monster design in general in all modern h&s games. Diablo 2 did it the best and implemented true monster variety, not only in visuals, but in AI behavior. Unfortunetaly, all monster designs in modern h&s depends on enemies rushing you down.\n\nI've seen people are obsessed about secrets in the game, if they meant secret bosses and areas with quests I can get that, it's good for game to have secrets like that, but if they also meant secret walls, where you can find usually one or two chests and a dead body, then I think you'll all insane, as there is literally no value in that type of secret room, one may be happy to find it in their first playthrough, but for a long period of time they are useless, as there will be no gear better than yours in that secret rooms.\n\nThe story is ok, nothing spectacular, many npcs doesn't have their voices, but I think that's a budget thing so whatever. There are many lore notes in the world, I honestly prefer other types of lore telling than standing for 2 minutes and reading in a Action game.\n\nGraphics I didn't mind the most of my time spent in game, however some skills are not satisfying to use.\n\nMusic in many locations is really good, however boss soundtracks just feels very off.\n\nOverall if you're looking for and action game for one playthrough, you may grab this one, but I'll not recommend it for anyone who want to invest crazy amount of time in one title, as there is very little interesting gameplay loop.\n\nUnusual for me but I'll leave comments open, so Mr. The_Mess can cry about someone disagreeing with his opinion, seriously bro, go out touch some grass and then play some other games.", "timestamp_created": 1736520933, "timestamp_updated": 1736768208, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534771978855133057", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185261520": {"recommendationid": "185261520", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993247949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 240, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1736518982}, "language": "english", "review": "Unexpectedly this game seems to be a clicker: click on enemies, they die, rinse and repeat.

Diablo foi um destes raros casos onde a combina\u00e7\u00e3o certas de diversos elementos culminou em algo atemporal. A est\u00f3ria macabra, a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o intimidadora, os acordes misteriosos da trilha sonora, a jogabilidade relativamente simples e as v\u00e1rias possibilidades de montar o seu personagem. Tudo isso foi combinado de uma maneira muito particular que marcou para sempre a vida de muitas pessoas.\nDiablo 2 soube dar continuidade a isso de forma inteligente, expandindo o conceito do primeiro jogo em todos os aspectos, mas preservando tudo aquilo que o tornava especial. Diablo 3 j\u00e1 n\u00e3o se saiu t\u00e3o bem. E Diablo Immortal foi uma piada de mau gosto. \n\nNos dez anos que separam o lan\u00e7amento de Diablo 3 e Diablo 4 \u00e9 onde surge Grim Dawn. Muito mais do que uma homenagem bem feita, Grim Dawn \u00e9 considerado por muitos o verdadeiro sucessor de Diablo 2.\nLan\u00e7ado em 2016 pela Crate Entertainment, Grim Dawn traz tudo aquilo que os primeiros dois Diablo tinham. O jogo foi feito na engine de outro grande ARPG dos anos 2000, Titan Quest, e segue muitas das mec\u00e2nicas que fizeram deste um dos melhores jogos do g\u00eanero. Ali\u00e1s, as similaridades entre os dois jogos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \u00e0 toa j\u00e1 que os fundadores da Crate s\u00e3o alguns dos principais criadores de Titan Quest. Sendo assim, n\u00e3o seria errado dizer que Grim Dawn est\u00e1 para Titan Quest o mesmo que Diablo 2 est\u00e1 para Diablo: maior, melhor, mas mantendo tudo aquilo que fez o primeiro game ser \u00fanico.\n\nTitan Quest inovou ao trazer um sistema de classe dupla. No come\u00e7o do jogo escolhemos uma classe, ou maestria. Em determinado momento mais adiante nos \u00e9 oferecida a op\u00e7\u00e3o de escolher uma segunda maestria. A nossa classe final ser\u00e1 o resultado dessa combina\u00e7\u00e3o.\nGrim Dawn segue a mesma f\u00f3rmula. As diferentes combina\u00e7\u00f5es entre as 10 classes dispon\u00edveis no jogo permite at\u00e9 90 classes diferentes e cada uma dessas classes pode ser jogada de formas diferentes, dependendo dos itens e das armas que voc\u00ea decidir usar.\nOutro ponto muito positivo herdado de Titan Quest s\u00e3o as mec\u00e2nicas de combate e dano. \u00c9 aquilo que eu defino como \"simples, mas complexo; complexo, mas simples\". O jogo \u00e9 bastante direto sobre os diferentes tipos de dano e debuffs, bem como as camadas de defesa. Pra quem quer apenas curtir a est\u00f3ria ou jogar com os amigos o sistema \u00e9 bem simples, mas sem ser entediante. Mas \u00e0 medida em que se progride para os modos mais dif\u00edceis \u00e9 preciso quebrar um pouco a cabe\u00e7a para otimizar sua build e encontrar os melhores itens.\n\nMas nem tudo \u00e9 uma c\u00f3pia de Titan Quest. Grim Dawn tamb\u00e9m trouxe mec\u00e2nicas pr\u00f3prias, al\u00e9m de corrigir problemas de seu antecessor.\nO sistema de constela\u00e7\u00f5es talvez seja maior adi\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c0 medida que vamos jogando encontramos alguns totens espalhados pelo mundo. Ao restaurar este totem ganhamos um ponto para ser gasto na tela de constela\u00e7\u00f5es. A sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de ver essa tela pela primeira vez \u00e9 a mesma de ver a \u00e1rvore de passivas do Path of Exile. Voc\u00ea abre e tem um milh\u00e3o de coisas para escolher. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem TDAH agora vai ter. Mas existe uma l\u00f3gica que direciona as escolhas e descobrir essa l\u00f3gica \u00e9 parte do desafio do jogo.\nH\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m um sistema de fac\u00e7\u00e3o onde voc\u00ea pode cumprir tarefas para ganhar respeito de um grupo e dessa forma desbloquear itens e miss\u00f5es exclusivas. Infelizmente n\u00e3o existe realmente um sistema onde voc\u00ea se aliar a uma fac\u00e7\u00e3o fecha o caminho para outra. H\u00e1 apenas um momento onde isso acontece, mas as duas fac\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o meio que a mesma coisa. Mas ainda assim \u00e9 uma adi\u00e7\u00e3o muito bem-vinda.\nPor fim, uma das corre\u00e7\u00f5es mais importantes feitas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Titan Quest \u00e9 o dano cr\u00edtico. Em TQ apenas ataques corpo a corpo podem dar cr\u00edtico. Magias e ataques \u00e0 dist\u00e2ncia n\u00e3o. Grim Dawn corrige isso e agora todo e qualquer dano tem chance de dar cr\u00edtico - como ali\u00e1s deve ser em todo ARPG.\n\nSobre a parte est\u00e9tica, o jogo \u00e9 bem bonito. Os gr\u00e1ficos, sobre tudo os personagens, lembram um pouco Diablo 3 e Warcraft 3, mas com um tom mais cinzento e sombrio. O mundo \u00e9 extremamente detalhado e repleto de segredos, com passagens escondidas que facilmente podem passar batidas na primeira vez. Os sons s\u00e3o muitos bons e a trilha sonora se encaixa perfeitamente pra criar um clima de desola\u00e7\u00e3o e ru\u00edna.\nA otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 bastante boa. Roda liso, mas tamb\u00e9m tem v\u00e1rias op\u00e7\u00f5es para PCs mais lentos. Suporte nativo para Ultrawide, tamanho do HUD customiz\u00e1vel. O filtro de loot \u00e9 bastante \u00fatil, embora seja muito menos customiz\u00e1vel do que o de Last Epoch, por exemplo. H\u00e1 uma infinidade de itens divididos em v\u00e1rias categorias. Os afixos dos itens tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o muitos. Os monstros aparecem em grandes n\u00fameros. Monstros \u00fanicos e chefes s\u00e3o bem legais at\u00e9, mas eles seguem o padr\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssico dos primeiros Diablo. Ou seja, nada de indica\u00e7\u00e3o visual para habilidades em \u00e1rea e outras coisas que temos em jogos mais novos.\nO multiplayer, infelizmente, segue o mesmo padr\u00e3o de Titan Quest. \u00c9 ruim. Jogar sozinho ou com amigos \u00e9 muito bom, mas jogar com rand\u00f4micos na Internet n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia muito boa.\n\nSobre as DLCs, existem tr\u00eas essenciais, uma de arena e tr\u00eas cosm\u00e9ticas.\nAshes of Malmouth \u00e9 a que adiciona mais conte\u00fado. Uma nova campanha e duas classes, Necromante e Inquisidor. Forgotten Gods traz outra campanha e a classe do Oathkeeper (Paladino). E por fim, Fangs of Asterkarn, que no momento em que escrevo ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel, mas trar\u00e1 uma nova campanha e uma nova classe, Berserker.\nCrucible Mode \u00e9 uma DLC de arena e \u00e9 exatamente o que o nome diz. S\u00e3o 6 arenas diferentes onde voc\u00ea enfrenta desafios cada vez maiores e acumula recompensas melhores. N\u00e3o \u00e9 um estilo de jogo que eu gosto muito. N\u00e3o sei dizer se existem itens ou sets exclusivos para esta DLC.\nSteam Loyalist Pack 1, 2 e 3 s\u00e3o DLCs puramente cosm\u00e9ticas que voc\u00ea compra apenas como forma de  ajudar a financiar o est\u00fadio.\n[b]Recomendo comprar o Grim Dawn Definitive Edition quando estiver em promo\u00e7\u00e3o.[/b]\n\nJogo recomendad\u00edssimo para quem gosta de ARPG cl\u00e1ssico com mec\u00e2nicas f\u00e1ceis de entender mas dif\u00edceis de dominar e onde voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa tirar um mestrado para entender a fundo o jogo e nem precisa ficar recorrendo a builds complicadas e sites externos para aproveitar o endgame. \u00c9 sentar e jogar, e deixar que o pr\u00f3prio jogo te ensine a jogar.

"language": "english", "review": "Now I wanna say real quick I'm not finished with Grim dawn yet not by a long shot, But I just wanna say this game Is Incredible and is deserving of all the love and hype around it. A lot of people look at the date and the gameplay trailer and assume its \"outdated\" or \"overhyped.\" (when they haven't even played it yet but honestly that's the average modern gamer in a nutshell tbh so lets move on.) The gameplay is the near perfect medium between diablo and POE, Its just simple enough where you would not need to look up a guide to help you but is complicated enough to make the progression engaging. It may look intimidating but all you need to know is if a stat goes up that's usually good and if your dps drops a tiny bit but raises your defenses increases majorly that's also good. The gems system is as simple as putting a extra boost on your gear. (if there able to added to that specific piece though of course.) The level up and devotion system is great and offers so many ways to customize your character and once you get to level 10 you can choose a second class to pair with your existing class and help synergize with your character and even each class you pair has a unique name once you choose your second class. (which is cool and I love that.) The devotion system is a way to get extra stat buffs and even unique abilities to then pair with your main skills, you will need to find devotion shrines around the world and some are hidden but there worth it to spend a bit of time getting them to massively boost your character. The story. (Who cares about a story in a ARPG.) The exploration is great and its encouraged to go to optional locations because while its more difficult it greatly rewards you with exp, high level loot and even devotion shrines. The base game is worth it even at full price but the game and its DLCs go on sale pretty often plus its going to have a new expansion later this year. overall this game is amazing a needs WAY more love and Im hyped to play even more of this game.

With no season structure i am not missing anything by playing the same character intermittently accross multiple years. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay itself is very engaging. Skills and item descriptions can seem a little daunting at time for new players. But, once you focus on the stats that you need, it is not that complex. You will spend a while looking at stats, ability and passives in trying to understand how it would all fit in your build. \r\n\r\nIn term of presentation, it is serviceable. The game has below average texture quality, even for its time. And the asthetic is kind of bland.

Why? Because this is how loot is supposed to be. From the very beginning on you just get pounded with loot and it's amazing. Then there's really weird things like... more storage, easy and cheap re-spec, non-disappearing portals, and non-respawning enemies, no fodder enemies that can kill you, no flasks... and possibly the best part: every DLC combined is less than one backpack in PoE2 lol. \r\n\r\nI don't mean to have so much vitriol about PoE2 but it's just terrible as far as games like this go. And Grim Dawn is everything you'd want. Granted I don't have a ton of time in the game yet, but enough to know that I'm having way more fun with this. When you add that the game was a mere $2.50, it makes it all the better. I bought all DLC at full price to support it, personally. \r\n\r\nIf there was anything I would change, it would be that green loot is better than yellow, and that's just a super weird choice. In every loot game you play its grey < green < blue < purple < yellow < orange... in this game it seems to be grey < yellow < green < blue < purple < (and possibly orange, not that far yet). I can't see any reason to do this except to make players think the loot they're getting is better than it really is due to years of programming.\r\n\r\nLastly, I wish there was more direction, and less maze-like connections between areas. Those also feel like they're done purely to slow you down, which never feels good. The game is big enough that it wouldn't make anyone play less if they could simply walk straight. But again... 500 times better than PoE2 who scrambles and resets the map when leaving the area, so if you portal to town and then gamble trying to get a usable piece of loot that's not 25 levels below your level for too long, and your portal disappears, have fun starting over.", "timestamp_created": 1736341061, "timestamp_updated": 1736341061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532861471176147461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185102447": {"recommendationid": "185102447", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022192618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2585, "playtime_at_review": 31480, "last_played": 1737254650}, "language": "english", "review": "Guud GAME!!", "timestamp_created": 1736340192, "timestamp_updated": 1736340192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185099237": {"recommendationid": "185099237", "author": {"steamid": "76561199625550568", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1736336890}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Gostando bastante do jogo", "timestamp_created": 1736336911, "timestamp_updated": 1736336911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185098679": {"recommendationid": "185098679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409691474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1567, "playtime_at_review": 3682, "last_played": 1736826969}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo muito legal, cheio de builds, segredos, divers\u00e3o, valeu o investimento.", "timestamp_created": 1736336329, "timestamp_updated": 1736336329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185094396": {"recommendationid": "185094396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010687016", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 1124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 1124, "deck_playtime_at_review": 1124, "last_played": 1736292738}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: I played this on the Steam Deck.\n\nTo run: I changed to using x64 launch option and Proton GE with FPS set at 40. Some stuttering but otherwise fine unless there's a big mob of enemies. It's worth increasing the UI size as it can be tiny on the Deck screen.\n\nHow it played: The game uses the Titan Quest engine (one of my favourite games) and for the most part was an enjoyable experience. The graphics look a bit dated now but the core mechanics are solid. The story is fine, but perhaps due to playing on the Steam Deck with a small UI and screen, found the plot slightly passed me by until the final boss was killed. \n\nRating: 7.5/10 + Recommended\n",

It\u2019s got two expansions (and a third on the way), and honestly, there\u2019s so much to do it\u2019s almost overwhelming. You can start out on Normal, but flipping on the Veteran option makes it a lot more interesting once you\u2019re used to how things work. And yeah, it\u2019s super addictive - once you finish, you\u2019ll probably want to dive back in with a new class or crank up the difficulty.\n\nThe world feels alive, with handcrafted maps that are actually fun to explore, a day-night cycle, weather, and even some verticality in the terrain. You can rotate the camera too, which is a nice touch. The multiclass system is awesome - there are so many combos to try out it\u2019s kind of ridiculous. And the factions, the environmental storytelling, and how much actual \u201cRPG\u201d is baked into the quests and character-building? It\u2019s all really well done.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not perfect. The damage types can feel like a lot at first (seriously, there are so many), and figuring out gear can get overwhelming. But once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s not too bad. If you\u2019re into summoner builds like me, you\u2019re gonna love this\u2014the pets here actually hold their own and feel really strong. It\u2019s probably the most fun I\u2019ve had with summons since Diablo 2.\n\nOverall, Grim Dawn is just a really fun game. It\u2019s not trying to be Path of Exile (which is actually a good thing for some people), and while it might feel a bit old-school, that\u2019s part of its charm. If you like ARPGs with lots of replay value and build options, it\u2019s definitely worth picking up - especially if it\u2019s on sale (I bought it for a couple bucks with all DLC's). \n\nGive it a shot, you might get hooked.", "timestamp_created": 1736287738, "timestamp_updated": 1736287738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "185052717": {"recommendationid": "185052717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041251844", "num_games_owned": 810, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 10657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10657, "last_played": 1646937321}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u044f \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1736285846, "timestamp_updated": 1736285846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185052281": {"recommendationid": "185052281", "author": {"steamid": "76561199553745968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 639, "playtime_at_review": 10932, "last_played": 1736521859}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u281b\u281b\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u288b\u28e9\u28c9\u28bb\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u28ff\u28f6\u28d5\u28c8\u2839\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u281f\u281b\u28db\u288b\u28f0\u2823\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2840\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28bb\u28ff\u28f6\u28f7\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u2836\u285d\u2800\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u2818\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u288f\u28ff\u28ff\u28cb\u28c0\u28c8\u28fb\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e4\u28e4\u28ff\u2850\u28bf\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6\u28a9\u28dd\u28eb\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u283f\u283f\u2826\u2800\u2838\u283f\u28fb\u28ff\u2844\u28bb\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\u28fc\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u28f0\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2880\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u280f\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28b8\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u28f0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u280b\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u280b\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u28b8\r\n\u28ff\u280f\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "timestamp_created": 1736285508, "timestamp_updated": 1736285508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185052176": {"recommendationid": "185052176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057393830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 955, "playtime_at_review": 1322, "last_played": 1736227621}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm 22 hours into the game and it's scratching that Diablo 2 itch I've had since Diablo 3 came out.

unsupported and there were no plans, and potentially NEVER will be plans to support it). \n\nAs such I ended up having to refund the game, which is a shame as it was great value and otherwise pretty accessible!!\n\nSpecifically, on Steam Deck, you cannot see the cursor when you are in the menus where you manage items etc, so while items change colour as if highlighted, you can't see where you are actually pointing which makes it incredibly frustrating to play. \n\nIronically the game runs really well apart from this, it\u2019s strange to me that a company wouldn\u2019t consider it worth while

This dark, gritty world is packed with lore, dangerous enemies, and an atmosphere that pulls you in from the very start. Its post-apocalyptic setting is rich with mystery and despair, creating a uniquely immersive experience.\n\nOne of Grim Dawn\u2019s most impressive features is its dual-class system. Players can mix and match from multiple classes, creating unique builds that cater to their playstyle. The abilities are not only powerful but visually satisfying, with each skill feeling impactful and rewarding. This customization, paired with a deep devotion system and extensive loot, gives the game near-infinite replayability.\n\nThe story is another strong point. Told through well-written quests, lore notes, and choices that influence the world, it\u2019s a tale of survival, betrayal, and hope. The narrative is supported by an atmospheric soundtrack that enhances every moment, from eerie exploration to intense battles.\n\nGraphically, Grim Dawn may not rival modern AAA titles, but it makes up for it with detailed environments, atmospheric lighting, and a cohesive visual style. Each area is packed with personality, and the game\u2019s design perfectly complements its grim and foreboding tone.\n\nThe sound design is also top-notch, from the clashing of weapons to the haunting ambient tracks.

engaging.  Even just playing the base game, players are rewarded with many places to visit, quests to complete, and a satisfying number of interwoven, apocalyptic stories to unravel.  Grim Dawn presents many compelling mysteries in ways rarely seen in ARPG games, and patient players will be rewarded for exploration with great regularity.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the overlapping of two selected classes in order to create new synergies is compelling in much the same way it was when the concept was first presented in Titan Quest, and players of that game will find a lot to like in this one as well.  And so, if you appreciate detailed ARPGs that present several un-lockable difficulty settings, then you should try Grim Dawn; it might just be right for you.", "timestamp_created": 1736136682, "timestamp_updated": 1736136682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184896062": {"recommendationid": "184896062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855258166", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1686, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1737053049}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736134558, "timestamp_updated": 1736134558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184895058": {"recommendationid": "184895058", "author": {"steamid": "76561199579894930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1736307116}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "N\u00e3o sou um cara que gosta muito de RPG, mas esse realmente me chamou bastante aten\u00e7\u00e3o e decidi comprar. \u00c9 um jogo com jogabilidade agrad\u00e1vel nem t\u00e3o simples e nem t\u00e3o complicada.

I love ARPGs and Grim Dawn is a super unique take on the genre. The story is compelling and the choices you make have pretty cool impacts on the world. Despite the age of the engine (it's from Titan Quest), everything feels super smooth and attacks are easily discernable and telegraphed well. All the skills feel fluid and unique and by and large it's pretty well balanced too. I was able to beat Ultimate Hardcore with just about most skills in the game that I found enjoyable.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is the lack of a real endgame beyond Shattered Realm and I hope that is addressed with either the second game or an expansion. I don't know what that would look like, but i'd like to see something a little more involved than SR as character builds only really come together around 94 once you are able to put on proper equipment which is a shame because thats about the time you finish the story.\r\n\r\nThis game is also easily moddable as well and there are plenty of mods out there. Some are minor balance changes or graphical changes, and others do things like remake the entirety of diablo 2 within the game.

it as an ARPG, that it's one of the better ones in the genre, and I wanted to try it out.\nIn the end, I found it to be really lackluster. It failed to interest me mechanically, narratively, graphically. Unchallenging on Veteran. I don't know why I played it for so long and expected it to get less boring.\n\nGAMEPLAY + MECHANICS:\nThe crux of the gameplay is basically just optimization: make a build, craft your gear to fit it. The main problem is that this is one or two button gameplay, a boring faceroll contest between you and waves of cannon fodder. The randomly-generated loot was worse than my current gear 90% of the time and the only noteworthy items were unique/crafted. The lack of information restriction on the Devotions made it very overwhelming to view initially, and it took a fair bit of time to look and plan out my build. May as well just be playing with a spreadsheet for all the fun it is.\n\nLots of visual noise in combat so there's a solid chance that, upon death, you might not be able to distinguish what actually killed you. Generally, you will spend your time destroying waves of hopelessly incompetent trash and then get into a slap fight with a single strong boss. I only felt cool when I got to later content which was more visually appealing.\n\nThe main draw I can see this having is just all the numberplay and loot rolling; it was neat to stack a bunch of buffs and effects into having a really stupidly strong build going, but in the end I was still just clicking on stuff, watching it near instantly die, and occasionally using an ability. A lot of damage types are just flavor to suit certain builds and classes, and to diversify the numbers a bit. Having two classes is what opens up character progression and customization options the most, but in the end it seems to just loop back into making your numbers go up, and I found it really unengaging. \n\nVISUALS + STORY:\nThe tone is grim a la Diablo but with a faint Victorian/Western twist to it. Doesn't really distinguish itself enough from its competitors enough to be interesting.\nAbout half of the game is visually bland when not ugly, and the audio failed to impress. Kind of irritated me how much of the gear literally looked like junk, and the whole \"iron is more valuable than gold\" spiel falls flat fast when you begin to drown in metals a few hours in (like why have the flavor text be so measurably incorrect).\n\nNot sure where the RPG part comes into play. Probably a misnomer, as is common in 'RPG' games. Nothing of value in terms of roleplay.\n\nAll-in-all, this is... a Diablo-adjacent ARPG. I'm not sure why I expected something different, but I did expect to get some enjoyment out of it.

I have not even really beaten the game to the peak of the end game content yet and each time I make a new character, I find new areas that engage with my sense of wonder about the game's depth at such a low file size compared to other major titles. Grim Dawn is a love-letter to gamers from gamers which make up the developer.\n\n- NO DRM: You live in a world where you buy a $70 title and 4 years later think to yourself, \"Man, I kind of want to play that game again!\" So you go about searching on how to install it so you can enjoy it once again only to find out that the game's servers have been taken offline by the game developer and the only way to play the game that you bought for the price of a month's cell phone bill is to illegally pirate the game. This means that even though you PAID for the game, you are forced to technically commit a crime in order to utilize your purchase. This is a HUGE problem in gaming these days. There have been a multitude of instances that a game's community has found a way to crack or mod the game in order to play without DRM to keep the game alive in it's vanilla state or even update/improve the game in some way only to have the game's developer SUE the community to remove this ability. Rockstar Games, for example took GTA3's servers offline a few years ago even though there was a very dedicated, albeit small, community of players that still enjoyed the game. The community did two things: Requested the source code from Rockstar in order to mod the game for play without DRM as well as started working on graphical upgrades that could bring in a wider audience. They didn't ask for money for this, but that didn't stop Rockstar from first denying the request and putting out a cease and desist order threatening the community from working on either of the things mentioned above. This is one example but many exist from nearly every major game studio from THQ to Bethesda. There is another aspect to this that also destroyed the gaming experience of my childhood, offline co-op play. Since you have to connect to the studio's servers for nearly every game you play now, you cannot have the offline co-op play or LAN parties that I enjoyed from my childhood on Counter-Strike 1.5 for example. You HAVE to have internet access and HAVE to connect to the server in order to utilize your purchase. I honestly don't know how this is legal since they are basically stealing your money if they stop offering the ability to play the game you bought, but here we are. Grim Dawn lets you play offline, with no DRM.\n\n- DIVERSE and BALANCED builds: Nearly ever skill in Grim Dawn is viable to create a build. You don't need to follow a guide on what is META to have access to later content like in Path of Exile 1 (and to a much larger extent in Path of Exile 2.) Instead of spending hours theory crafting in Path of Building or mobalytics in order to see if an idea you have will be able to scale enough to beat Uber Elder or farm T17 maps (or even get past T1 waystones in Path of Exile 2,) you just pick which abilities you enjoy and then go about customizing them with gear add-ons or interactions within the wide-ranging class choices. You can be a thorns spell caster or a gun-slinging summoner and you are not backed into a corner because you are afraid that after 20 hours you'll find that your skills are worthless after a point in the game. This allows true player choice and is very refreshing in the face of near mandatory build specificity of POE. Grim Dawn is a gem in a field of dirt in this regard.\n- After nearly a decade now (over if you include Early Access) content is still being put out by the developer and on that note the developer actually allows the community to mod the game for seasonal content: As previously stated, the fact that you can buy a game and come back after a few years only to have your purchase be completely voided save for the real money you spent, Grim Dawn not only keeps updating the game with more fine-tuned balance, bug fixes, and content such as DLC, but has allowed if not encouraged the community to mod and improve upon the base game to allow seasonal content updates and complete modification to the point that it is a different game altogether.\n- NO MICROTRANSACTIONS: The only money you will spend will be for the base game and the DLCs, no lootboxes, skins, or pay to win. This is a breath of fresh air in the current video game world we live in where you spend $70 dollars for a game only to then have to engage with the in-game shop that will allow you to actually have fun in the game (Path of Exile's stash tabs are a lesser egregious example of this because it's free, but still an example nonetheless.)  \n- Only 5GB!!!!!: The entire base game as well as all the DLC can fit on a mid-grade hard-drive from 2001. This is in stark contrast to many other titles that require a fairly percentage of a 1TB storage device's memory to install. This has the beneficial add-on effect of allowing near instantaneous loading of new areas as the data required to load into the areas is very small compared to modern-gaming PCs very minimum RAM specifications. It also allows for nearly zero strain on your hardware. \nNow on to areas which may feel off-putting to more modern audiences but I don't mind at all and actually gives is a plus to me:\n- Linear Game Play: Since there is no procedural generated layouts, once you explore the area that's it. There's no continuing to explore the same area over and over again in order to complete an objective or get to a boss. You can redo an area of course but your map will still have every part of the area explored. Some will feel it is monotonous whereas I have the opposite opinion and feel that exploring the same area over and over again only artificially adds to the time you are playing and offers no real benefit to the player. \n- Graphics were old back when it launched a decade ago, they are ancient now: Crate Entertainment bought the Titan Quest game engine from Iron Lore Entertainment when that developer went under. This means that the engine the game is built on is over 20 years old and there is almost no possibility for a major graphical update without a re-release of the game which will probably never happen. Again, I don't mind this and think not only gives a certain charm to the game but also allows for that previously mentioned (comparatively) extremely small filesize and fantastic ability to run on even very-out-of-date hardware. Many modern audiences however probably are turned-off by the ancient graphics quality you'd find on a later Playstation 2 title. \n- No Psychological Effect: While not many people talk about this, nearly every game studio from Triple-A to larger indie ones either employ Psychologists or employ research done by them in order to trigger a psychologically addictive response in their titles to get player retention (so you can continuously spend money in the in-game store.)

This game manages to hit the sweet spot of having many things in abundance, but nothing in excess:\n- Enough dark elements to provide a, well... grim experience, but not enough for the dark atmosphere to be stifling and crossing into the horror territory,\n- Enough interesting lore if you choose to learn about the world, but at no point does the game bombard you with it,\n- Enough graphical effects to telegraph and enhance skill animations and ambience, but not enough to turn your screen into a party-light simulator,\n- Enough loot to trigger that dopamine release but not enough to give you RSI from picking everything up, thanks to built-in simple-yet-efffective loot filters,\n- Enough gear complexity and build variety to keep the game interesting and replayable, but not enough to require a PhD to understand.\n\nAll that is not to say that the game is perfect - I've had my fair share of frustrations with the sheer amount of slow-walking necessary to get from point A to point B. And, let's be honest, if you are serious about this game but not using  Grim Tools, you are shooting yourself in the foot. Sure, you could view Grim Tools as a testament to the dedication and ingeniousness of the community, but I choose to view it as a failure of the game's UI. Build-planning, viewing monster loot pools (otherwise good luck finding out where your build-defining rare piece drops), and shrine-tracking should not require alt-tab to access. \n\nBut despite some shortcomings, if you are looking for a slower-paced loot-based game with a solid dose of hopelessness and despair thrown into the mix, Grim Dawn is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1735939875, "timestamp_updated": 1735940365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184678668": {"recommendationid": "184678668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068815634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1285, "playtime_at_review": 20025, "last_played": 1737337016}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game!

The fact you can decide to play a specific expansion is pretty good and gives you an overall different experience as you're moving through this well written story with some interesting choices that will impact your                             game.", "timestamp_created": 1735930444, "timestamp_updated": 1735930444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184665876": {"recommendationid": "184665876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970683850", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 7856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1792, "playtime_at_review": 5741, "last_played": 1736726014}, "language": "english", "review": "I've tried many ARPGs in the 'Diablo' style, and Grim Dawn is certainly in the top tier.

I've played a lot of APRGs, been entertained by a couple, bored by most, and loved none of them. Grim Dawn excels in most every measure, and, in particular, in its story and class customisation. It's the only ARPG I've ever played that actually leans into the RPG elements in more than just a 'points into the skill tree' way.\n\nAs is typical of the genre, the story is relatively light, but the written notes you find around the world are, without exception, superb narrative fiction. It's wild that a host of characters you'll never meet are diverse, deep, nuanced, believable, and tell stories in the scraps they leave behind that are uniformly compelling, be they desperately sad or genuinely chilling. The trek through a townscape overrun by cultists and hideous extradimensional beasts is particularly memorable. To be clear - the writing in this game is exceptional, period. Not just for the genre. \n\nThe character classes are on another level in terms of their customisability. The option to multiclass is catered for in all kinds of gear, but pouring all your points into one class will turn your character into a cloud of destruction. There are several layers of skills that open up to you, slowly building up your powers in a way that makes me think of Vampire Survivors. The difficulty is well balanced though as enemies level up with you for the most part though, and certain areas of the game remain challenging right through to the end. \n\nI'm bothered I didn't finish the base game before the sale because I usually get bored with ARPGs well before the end and didn't know if I'd want to play any more. But I do. I want to discover more about this world. It's a really easy pick-up-and-play experience and multiplayer works well. All together Grim Dawn is an absolute class act. If, like me, you've never enjoyed an ARPG because of their lack of depth and story, then give this a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1735881976, "timestamp_updated": 1735884720, "voted_up": true,

Now Diablo 4? GD runs rings around that sorry excuse of a sequel. \n\nThe game is darn fun. I've played mostly on easy settings as I enjoy casual gameplay over hardcore combat, and I did not find it TOO challenging, but I definitely would not call it too easy either. Seems like a nice balance between having fun and finding enemies and puzles to challenge your skillsets.\n\nThe games overall story and atmosphere is pretty dark, with undead, demons, and various otherworldly entities, and with more than the occasional spats of gore and horror. The game is not really all that 'scary', but Grim Dawn definitely succeeds in setting a good 'dark fantasy'/horror atmosphere similar in fashion to that of Diablo 3; but as I mentioned, IMO Diablo 3 lands that feel a little bit better.  \n\nI should note that while I have not finished the game, I HAVE played through the first couple of 'acts,' and had an absolute blast, but I have been playing other games as of late (mostly Fallout 76 and Space Engineers with my buddy). Now I plan to get back into Grim Dawn, but this time I want to do a co-op playthrough with my buddies. \n\nAlso, this game REALLY delivers, considering a base price of $25. You can't beat that, that's just $5 more than Diablo III on Battle.net, a game that came out nearly 5 years prior to GD (you can't get D3 on Steam, but you CAN get D4?....ok Blizzard lol)\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this game to fans of Diablo 3, dark fantasy/horror games (again, not super scary but sets a great atmosphere), and/or isometric action RPG games. If your looking for an immersive true RPG game with all the mechanics that come with games like Dragon Age or Elder Scrolls, you may be disappointed. This is definitely a more causal hack and slash-style 'Action' RPG. But if that sounds down your alley, than consider this little indie gem. You will not be let down.\n\nOne minor complaint: there appears to be a bug in the Steam Store page, I was able to purchase the base game as a gift for my buddy, but it is not allowing me to buy the Definitive Edition with all the DLCs as a gift for anyone. I think it MAY have to do with the fact that I already own the base game and all but one of the DLCs, but that really should not affect my ability to buy things that I ALREADY own...for OTHER PEOPLE. This must be some sort of bug in the Steam Store.

I can play this game on a 10 year old laptop in the middle of antarctica. There is no always online, there are no season to get FOMO over, there's no cash shop constantly being pushed into the game. It's just a good game that I enjoy playing.\r\n\r\n- Best class(dual)/skill/devotion system I've seen yet, best itemization I've seen yet, within the most satisfying physics despite \"old\" age, atmosphere, especially in forgotten gods expansion. Quality of everything, lack of bugs, good balance of everything (comparing to other games of the genre), immense single player content, variety of builds and how different they can get, and how customizable they can be, you can make your own builds work to this date, etc. It just doesn't get boring as quickly as anything else I've played from the genre ever, newer or older. 2nd best is Titan Quest - same engine, same team game. Can't wait for Titan Quest 2.\r\n\r\n- Engaging Storyline: The game's narrative is compelling, with rich lore and a dark, atmospheric world that draws you in from the very beginning. The post-apocalyptic setting is beautifully crafted, and the unfolding story keeps you hooked as you uncover the mysteries of Cairn.\r\n\r\n- Deep Customization: Grim Dawn excels in its character customization. The dual-class system allows for incredible flexibility and creativity in building your character. Whether you prefer a tanky warrior, a spell-casting mage, or a hybrid of both, the game provides endless possibilities to tailor your hero to your playstyle.\r\n\r\n- Community and Support: The Grim Dawn community is welcoming and active, always ready to share tips, builds, and advice. The developers, Crate Entertainment, are highly responsive and dedicated to improving the game, ensuring a fantastic experience for all players.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Grim Dawn is a must-play for fans of the action RPG genre. Its engaging storyline, deep customization, challenging gameplay, rich content, and stunning visuals make it a standout title that you won't want to miss. Whether you're a veteran ARPG player or new to the genre, Grim Dawn promises an adventure that will keep you captivated for countless hours.", "timestamp_created": 1735822541, "timestamp_updated": 1735822541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565789461135864258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184526699": {"recommendationid": "184526699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123453634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 406, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1735822130}, "language": "schinese", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1735822143, "timestamp_updated": 1735822143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184526673": {"recommendationid": "184526673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013076461", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2508, "last_played": 1582507534}, "language": "english", "review": "My best friend Tomato Gaming recommended this game to me and I agree its really good!", "timestamp_created": 1735822125, "timestamp_updated": 1735822125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184524109": {"recommendationid": "184524109", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087834381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1016, "playtime_at_review": 750, "last_played": 1737276964}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\uff01\u7231\u73a9\uff01\u54d0\u54d0\u6b7b", "timestamp_created": 1735819736, "timestamp_updated": 1735819736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184521915": {"recommendationid": "184521915", "author": {"steamid": "76561199077898384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1418, "playtime_at_review": 913, "last_played": 1737206274}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1735817612, "timestamp_updated": 1735817612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184521456": {"recommendationid": "184521456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174849714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 7353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4581, "playtime_at_review": 2703, "last_played": 1737151736}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "10/10 jogo mto bom, conte\u00fado infinito, builds infinitas!

Fits the Gameworld/Story perfectly.\n\nSounds/Music:\nNothing to write home about and yet perfectly fine, although some effects will get on your nerves sooner than later (looking at you Blade-Pets/WaterCyclone-Pets)\n\nAtmosphere:\nThough some areas are brightly lit, the overall atmosphere of the game feels rather sinister / dark and gives off a slight \"Endtimes\" vibe.\n\nStory:\nYour typical, run of the mill, ARPG-Story. Although with a nice Lovecraftian touch.\n\nGameplay:\nBe it a dualwielding Nightblade-Necromancer (Reaper) or a Rifle firing Shamen-Inquisitor (Vindicator), it is fun to engage in combat. At level 10 you can and should pick your 2nd Class. Lots of combination and i've yet to see one that is not \"endgame valid\". Some might make more sense than others, while some might not really seem to be a good fit (but they are or can be).\n\nDiificulty:\nOn the normal difficulty it's your typical Diablo2 experience. It gets more challenging the further you advance in the story. Keep an eye out on your resistances because standing in fire/poison/aether WILL hurt. On higher difficulties you resistances will get nerfed so keep that in mind. Healing- and resistance-skills are you friend.\n\nGrinding/Farming:\nYes. There is gear-farming. This however is needed more on the endgame (hightest difficulty) than in an \"average\" playthrough. In addition to gear you can also farm reputation which in turn let's you get gear from factions and later on even fight special faction-bosses.\n\nBugs:\nI'm on my 2nd playthrough and have not encountered a single bug. This is the most stable piece of software i've seen in years. Major Triple-A titles could learn from this game.\n\nExpansions:\nThey give new classes, new story chapters, new areas, new mechanics and new gamemodes. Are they worth the full price? That's for you to decide, not me. Are they worth getting them? That's a big yes. And in 2025 a third expansion will come out.\n\n\nMy rating:\nI'll give this game 10 out of 10 Stars. While getting a nostalgic retro feeling it's an up to date little gem of a game. Challenging but not difficult for beginners while challenging and fun for the more advanced crowd. I seriously tried to find something i could complain about.

Which could be either a plus or minus for you. Watching a few build guide videos is enough to get you rolling successfully through Normal difficulty, and by the end you'll pretty much know what you're doing for future builds. \n- Expansion sales are reasonable, but include the base game so you end up buying it twice if you eventually want the expansions, which you will.

Here's a list of my favorite traits that it has rolled (in no particular order):\n\n\u2022 You can rotate the camera.\n\n\u2022 This game is made by players, for players. The developers are awesome. They're active & they're active in the community. The community is also active. I often find the devs talking to players in random comment sections of the game's subreddit. These devs truly are passionate about the game, and I mean that in the best way possible. (Thank goodness the game is such an absolute unit of a banger.)\n\n\u2022 I've yet to experience a single bug or glitch.\n\n\u2022 It has the best itemization I've ever seen. (Itemization is the name of the game, baby...)\n\n\u2022 You can target-farm for many of the best items, many of which can entirely transform your build. (Target-farming is the name of the game, baby... but only if you want it to be.)\n\n\u2022 You can rotate the camera.\n\n\u2022 You can choose 2 classes per character (you may see classes referred to as \"masteries\").  Every class/mastery combination is viable. (Experimentation is the name of the game, baby... but only if you want it to be.)\n\n\u2022 It's impossible to brick a character. This game is very forgiving of your failed experimentation & it respecs your time. (Respecs are very cheap, easy, & available very early. You can respec everything except your 2 classes.)\n\n\u2022 Almost every Quality-of-Life feature that I wished for in other ARPGs is here, in Grim Dawn. (QoL is the name of the game, baby... Deal with it!) \n\n\u2022 You can rotate the camera.\n\n\u2022 It has extremely rich lore & an interesting story. DO NOT skip dialog & lore notes in this game. You'll be doing yourself a huge disservice... It's so good. If you DO skip it, it won't ruin your build or playthrough or anything... but it will ruin my respect for you and your lack of proper decision-making skills.\n\n\u2022 There's a good amount of side quests, plus even more secrets & replayability. (Replayability is the name of the game, baby... but only if you want it to be.)\n\n\u2022 The game is STILL receiving updates and new content / DLC, even after ~8 years. (Each time a DLC drops, the devs state \"this will be the last one.\" Lol)\n\n\u2022 The game is offline, but you can still play co-op online though. There's just no online ladder (although there's a mod to remedy that, called the \"Community Ladder\"). \n\n\u2022 The world is hand-crafted, it's not procedurally generated. This allows for the existence of many beautiful views, hand-placed secrets, and other facets that simply are not offered in other ARPG games. The issue of familiarity is remedied by the fact that you can rotate the camera. (I was hesitant of this at first, but I've quickly learned that a simple rotation of the camera goes a very long way to increase longevity & cease any monotony... it works much better than I initially expected.)\n\n\u2022 There are some procedurally generated dungeons, I believe. One of which I know is an infinite roguelite-esque dungeon.  It's kind of similar to how \"Maps\" work in PoE 2, but it's a little different. It does incrementally save your progress if you leave or close the game, which is great!\n\n\u2022 No microtransactions. There are the \"Steam Loyalist\" DLCs here on Steam, but they are purely cosmetic packs that are only meant for people who want to support the awesome devs. Regardless, it's a much better deal than any I've ever seen in another game. \n\n\u2022 You can rotate the camera.\n\nI'm sure there's more that I've forgotten, but that's all I can think of at the moment. I give it a 10/10. It's definitely a must-buy if you're a fan of the genre. This game is a hidden gem. Thankfully, due to PoE2's recent emergence into Early Access, a lot more people are now learning about the wonderful world of Grim Dawn and all it has to offer you. \n\nyours truly,\na fellow ARPG-enjoyer", "timestamp_created": 1735699525, "timestamp_updated": 1735699525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508244931697845459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184388209": {"recommendationid": "184388209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335609085", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5691, "playtime_at_review": 4316, "last_played": 1737300403}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5237\u5237\u5237", "timestamp_created": 1735699031, "timestamp_updated": 1735699031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184387989": {"recommendationid": "184387989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126353357", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 769, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1737163818}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Otimo game, simplesmente amo a sensacao de explorar o mapa e achar cada pedacinho de lugar e iluminar tudo, o combate e bem legal e a historia e ok ate, ja tinha jogado antes e sempre quis pegar pela steam, vou zerar o modo normal e depois ir pegando as DLC tudo. 100% Viciante.", "timestamp_created": 1735698836, "timestamp_updated": 1735698836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184387279": {"recommendationid": "184387279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452037332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5769, "last_played": 1725689576}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u932f", "timestamp_created": 1735698159, "timestamp_updated": 1735698159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184386966": {"recommendationid": "184386966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058378660", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "deck_playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1735696733}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435 -

Die Neugier wurde zu gro\u00df, da es mich sehr an das gute alte Dungeon Siege erinnerte. Und was soll ich sagen? Nach 7 Stunden hier meine ersten Eindr\u00fccke.\nEs ist besser als Dungeon Siege! Und auch besser als Diablo. Es kommt sogar an das Legend\u00e4re Sacred 2 dran.\nIch liebe diese Spiele daher waren meine Erwartungen auch recht hoch.\n\nPositiv:\n- Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist dr\u00fcckend und d\u00fcster. Sie passt Perfekt zu dem Spiel! Ich w\u00fcrde hier sogar Kopfh\u00f6rer empfehlen um es richtig zu genie\u00dfen. In einem dunklen Keller, bekommt man wirklich gro\u00dfen Spa\u00df. ;-)\n- Die Musik ist sehr angenehm und unterstreicht die Atmosph\u00e4re.\n- Verschiedene Klassen, die kombiniert werden k\u00f6nnen.\n- Es gibt Fraktionen, bei den man einen Ruf hat. Der sich im Laufe der Zeit ver\u00e4ndert. Was mich direkt zum n\u00e4chsten Punkt bringt.\n- Die Quests arbeiten damit. Hilft man den Leuten hat das tats\u00e4chlich Auswirkung. Es gibt pl\u00f6tzlich Quests von Leuten, die einem vorher nicht vertraut haben. Man bekommt bessere Preise bei den ans\u00e4ssigen H\u00e4ndlern, neue Gegenst\u00e4nde und und und. Absolut genial! So macht es auch Spa\u00df die Aufgaben zu erledigen.\n- Noch einen Pluspunkt gibt es, dass die Fraktionen auch untereinander verfeindet sind. Was zus\u00e4tzliche Dynamiken bringt.\n- Verfeindete Fraktionen werden Feindlicher je mehr man von ihnen t\u00f6tet. Mehr, st\u00e4rkere Gegner bis hin zu Nemesis Boss K\u00e4mpfe werden dadurch erm\u00f6glicht.\n- Die K\u00e4mpfe sind klassisch Hack and Slash, was etwas eint\u00f6nig ist aber dennoch Spa\u00df macht.\n- Innovativ finde ich auch, dass man Br\u00fccken reparieren muss, um in bestimmte Gebiete zu gelangen.\n- Die Grafik ist gut. Nicht umwerfend aber f\u00fcr das Alter in Ordnung. Ich selbst achte nicht so sehr auf Grafik. F\u00fcr mich reicht es.\n- Keine Bugs oder Abst\u00fcrze. Zumindest bisher. Oder ich bin Blind und hab sie nicht bemerkt.\n\nNegativ:\nTats\u00e4chlich habe ich bisher keine Kritik. Ich werde meine Bewertung am Ende nochmal anpassen.\nVielleicht kommt dann noch etwas.

Whether you aim to create a spell-flinging tank or a melee glass cannon, the possibilities are endless.  \n\n[b]2. Rich, Dark World[/b]  \nThe post-apocalyptic Victorian setting is beautifully realized. The story and quests are engaging, with plenty of secrets to uncover. The environments are hand-crafted, filled with stunning details and a variety of biomes.  \n\n[b]3. Loot, Loot, Loot[/b]  \nGrim Dawn doesn\u2019t skimp on loot. The gear progression feels rewarding, with legendary items offering unique builds and playstyles.  \n\n[b]4. Replayability[/b]  \nWith multiple difficulty levels, expansive content, and multiple factions to align with or oppose, the game keeps drawing you back for more.  \n\n[h2]The Shadows[/h2]  \n\nWhile Grim Dawn excels in many areas, it\u2019s not a perfect 10/10.  \n\n[b]1. No Random Level Generation[/b]  \nUnlike [i]Path of Exile[/i] or [i]Diablo[/i], Grim Dawn lacks randomized levels. This can make repeat playthroughs feel somewhat predictable, especially for players who prefer the chaos and unpredictability of procedural generation.  \n\n[b]2. Multiplayer Can Be Clunky[/b]  \nThough functional, the multiplayer experience isn\u2019t as seamless as some other ARPGs, with occasional connection issues and a lack of quality-of-life features for party management.  \n\n[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]  \n\n[b]Grim Dawn[/b] is a must-play for fans of the ARPG genre. Its intricate systems, deep lore, and polished gameplay make it a standout title. While it doesn\u2019t quite match the dynamism of [i]PoE[/i] or [i]Diablo[/i] in some respects, its handcrafted charm more than makes up for it. If you\u2019re looking for an ARPG with soul and substance, Grim Dawn delivers in spades.  \n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/Grim_Dawn/]Check it out on Steam[/url]!", "timestamp_created": 1735678235, "timestamp_updated": 1735836559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184364878": {"recommendationid": "184364878", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989602676", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1735838635}, "language": "english", "review": "boring, because no thread forces you to progress - i would call it a cozy RPG for RPG-newbies.

Gear capable of not just nudging but completely altering skills, paired with the unusual design of every skill point having potential value to your class regardless of what you're playing, basically every single part of the \"RPG\" part of \"ARPG\" is down downright flawlessly. Rather than directly competing with the formula provided by Diablo and Path of Exile by jamming some arbitrary attempt at a spin on top of it, it has just taken a look at the general idea of how things should work, and built from scratch with that as a rough shape, rather than trying to mimic it with slapdash alterations.\n\nBut I can't say I like the feel of actually.. playing? I don't know if it's just a me problem, but the levelling feels sluggish, map exploration feels unrewarding and targetting feels like it very often wants to redirect my aim to where my enemy is, despite the intent of aiming ahead of them to actually hit them with the attacks that are somewhat slower moving projectiles when I'm further away. The voice acting is very high quality, yet the actual things being read are sentences that drone on awfully and dance endlessly *around* actually telling the story. The RPG parts of the game might be done incredibly, but how those parts are all glued together around the game product feels haphazard at best.

I just lived with it at first, but then I found the fix on Reddit.

I also recommend rebinding one of the left-hand buttons to the \"Sell\" button so you don't have to go from joystick to X over and over again.

It has great game play without all the nuisances that bog down other ARPGs. I bought Grim Dawn during the 2024 Winter Sale when it was $2.49 for the base game on a whim that maybe it would be worth trying out. I was surprised at how good it was.\n\nPROS\n+ It's fun. Seriously, I am not big on ARPGs. I really loved Diablo and Diablo II when I was a kid, and I bought Diablo III and Diablo IV thinking they'd be as good, but was disappointed by them for various reasons. Grim Dawn is the first time since Diablo II that I've just wanted to keep going without stopping. I bought the game almost 2 weeks ago and have 24.5 hours in and plan to keep going.\n+ It's easy and challenging at the same time. The game meets you where you want to be. Are you a casual player who wants to hack and slash and explore? Normal mode has got you covered. Are you in for a nightmarish challenge? Then go for ultimate mode. \n+ All builds are viable. Just pick your skills and go. You don't have to lookup a build guide to figure out how to optimize your play style. Pick skills, pick up equipment that fits your style, and have at it. Yes, you can still look up things if you want, but ultimately you can't go wrong.\n+ The story is decent and it's gradually revealed.\n+ The DLC are completely optional, but add a wealth of content if you are into it (I've yet to start them). Even if you don't get them the base game by itself is deep in gameplay and content.\n+ The base game is still being updated with content and QoL features.\n+ It's well optimized. I comfortably play this game at 4K ultra settings at a constant 144 HZ refresh without a single stutter or issue. I've even got it modded to give me higher-res 4x textures.\n+ You can mod the game to fit your playstyle if you want. I only have a graphics mod added to give me a higher-quality texture experience, but there's an active modding community available.\n+ Don't like the way you've invested your build? There's an NPC that will let you respec without issue.\n+ The price is incredible for what the game is.\n+ No subscriptions. No daily rewards. No loot boxes. No season passes. No crazy DRM or constant online requirements.\n+ This game works great with a Keyboard and Mouse, but is surprisingly well-optimized for a gamepad. Never would I have thought I'd play an ARPG with a gamepad, but I actually prefer it to a KB+Mouse in most cases, because I can simply sit back in my chair and game without having to lean in. It's great.\n\nCONS\n- The story is there, but it's also easy to ignore if you aren't paying attention. The cutscenes and cinematics aren't as much as you'd find in a big budget game, so you'll need to pay attention to dialogue and in-game notes to keep up (or read your journal to refresh / catch up).\n- The devotion system is not the most intuitive to new players and is probably worth looking up before you invest devotion points into a node. This could honestly use a bit more love from a tutorial or descriptions standpoint.\n- Some skills have very basic descriptions and the main way to learn about them is to just choose it and see what happens, or go lookup somewhere else (but it's not really needed).\n- The graphics are somewhat dated, but it honestly still looks good. I installed a mod that adds 4x textures to give the visuals a nice bump and it's quite beautiful now.\n\nNotes:\n- I haven't tried online or co-op mode yet.\n- I have purchased the DLCs to support the developers but haven't tried any of them yet as I'm still exploring the base game / campaign.\n- I have not played this on a Steam Deck, only on PC.", "timestamp_created": 1735594508, "timestamp_updated": 1735594713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184257530": {"recommendationid": "184257530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054506620", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 82512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 487, "playtime_at_review": 80822, "last_played": 1737324895}, "language": "english", "review": "A well-balanced game where you can fix your mistakes with skill build, and lots of fun. \n\nYou can choose whatever skill or damage type that you want, or weapon that you want to wield/dual-wield, or even play summoner/pet build and still beat the game and challenge the endgame content.

I\u2019ve only played for about 5 hours so far, but here are my first impressions.  \n\nAt first, I thought it would be just like other RPGs and wouldn\u2019t bring anything new to the table\u2014but I was wrong! Every new location introduces new monsters and loot, and I\u2019m not even mentioning the skills or class divisions, which are simply amazing.  \n\nI have to admit that this game is fantastic because it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt so immersed in an RPG. While my English isn\u2019t perfect, the game itself completely captivated me\u2014both in terms of gameplay and atmosphere.  \n\nI\u2019m already looking forward to playing it with my brother or even solo on a chill evening.  \n\n---  \n\nGame Rating: (1+ - 5+)  \n\nPros:  \n- Design: ++++  \n- Controls: ++++  \n- Storyline: ++++  \n- Monsters: +++++  \n- Sound: ++++  \n- Voice Acting: ++++  \n- Optimization: +++  \n- Server Stability: +++++  \n- Map Design: ++++  \n- Class System: +++++  \n- Skills: +++++  \n- Armor and Weapons: +++++  \n- Fast Loading Times: ++++  \n- Leveling System: ++++  \n\nCons:  \n- Settings don\u2019t save properly. I have to reset them every time, which is a bit annoying, and I don\u2019t know why this happens.  \n- Occasional stuttering. I\u2019m not sure if this is a **loading issue** or something on my end, but it\u2019s a minor drawback.  \n\n---  \n\nFinal Thoughts: \n\nSo far, this is my review after 5 hours of gameplay. My opinion may change as I continue playing, but for now, I\u2019m sticking with this positive impression.", "timestamp_created": 1735551473, "timestamp_updated": 1735551473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184202276": {"recommendationid": "184202276", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993981646", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1735549504}, "language": "english", "review": "Do game developers not play their games? Or not play test them? At all? This game is abysmal.\r\n\r\nFirst, the font is unreadable. It isn't flavor, it's an active impediment to the game.\r\n\r\nSecond, the START button is grayed out by default. Literally everyone involved in the decision making processes of this game should never be allowed to touch software development ever again. You're supposed to find the small, obscure CREATE CHARACTER button in the corner and press that first. When was this game developed, 1970? Just kidding, text adventure games had clearer interfaces. There should be a central advance to play button (\"Start\", for example, but not mucked up with the other junk), that prompts the player to solve any outstanding issues - ie, shepherd them to character selection / creation, difficulty, etc.,. \r\n\r\nThird, ... you know what? Just look at the half baked quest interface. If you can even read what's to do, it's easier to accidentally not accept a quest than it is to accept a quest. And why would you not accept a quest? Who knows. The game certainly has no interest in explaining anything. It clearly doesn't even care if you stick around and / or play it.\r\n\r\nFourth, speaking of amateur hour, IF you randomly press buttons and figure out leveling up, and select a skill, make sure you also randomly right click on your action bar to add your skills to it. The game has no interest in shepherding new players either into default-adding skills to an empty skillbar, nor teaching the idioms.\r\n\r\nAnd this all from 12 minutes in!

If you have played Titan Quest, this game runs on a modified version of the engine Titan Quest uses so many aspects of the game are similar but it is way more polished than Titan Quest.\n\nFans of the genre may be turned off by the worlds being completely static. However, unlike Titan Quest it makes full use of the worlds being hand-made by filling it full of secrets and set pieces that tell stories (with plenty of lore notes to supplement these set pieces). If you're a real lore head, you will find more than enough notes to read to learn more about the world and the struggles people suffer in Cairn.\n\nThe game is long, and the game uses the traditional method of story progression by having you complete it multiple times to reach end game. You can skip doing that with future characters in the Forgotten Gods expansion pack. However the journey (not the destination) is the whole point of the game so many players will gladly play and replay the game over and over. \n\nThis game has the best ARPG character building I have seen in a game, hands-down. There are 6 masteries in the base game and 3 more added in expansions (with yet another one being added in a future expansion). You combine two masteries to make a class. You can mix and match their skills as you see fit and then using the Devotion system you can affix more skills onto your main skills as procs. Then you can use items and components that give you more skills. If you have the Ashes of Malmouth expansion, you can then use items that change the skills you have to make them more powerful or even make skills that didn't fit your build at all fit it like a glove. Many of these items are target-farmable through the Monster Infrequent system. Monster Infrequent items are items with extra stats on them that only drop from specific monsters. The affixes they drop with are weighted so that they are more likely to be useful for their niche to reduce grinding. It is a genius system that makes sure that you can get the specialized gear you need without endlessly grinding. It is a system that is borrowed from Titan Quest but is tuned to be a lot more engaging and less grindy.\n\nCombat in-game is quite slow-paced compared to other ARPGs. It is faster than Titan Quest but slower than others like Last Epoch. It is personal preference as to whether this is a good or bad thing. How the game's combat feels can vary wildly depending on how experienced you are at the game, however. The first time I played it felt like I was hitting everything with a wet noodle because I did not understand how the mechanics worked. Now that I know how it works, it feels much more satisfying. Sounds for melee strikes are meaty and crunchy (especially with critical hits). Spell effects are flashy and spectacular-looking, albeit they feel really weak and muted if you have particles and lighting set to low settings. The game recently received an update to melee attack animations and feel much better than they used to in previous versions. While the combat isn't to everyone's liking, I find it is the perfect pace and is quite satisfying to perform.\n\nMuch of the combat is stat and knowledge-checking and is not reflex-dependent. Bosses can one-shot you with hard-to-dodge attacks or even impossible-to-dodge attacks if you do not have your defensive layers in order. It is important that you focus on defense over offense in your gear or you will suffer. A lot. If your resists are low you'll be taking 4-5x more damage than what you are expected to take and if your Defensive Ability is low enemies will have a chance to do 1.1-1.4x damage to you randomly and all of their attacks will make their mark. In recent versions they added a dodge mechanic that everyone starts with and you can get multiple mobility options through your mastery and items. However, those are not needed with proper positioning and preparation.\n\nThe story is serviceable. The game does not focus on story and makes it largely skippable, which makes the game much better for repeat playthroughs. There are NPCs who you can talk to for more context and world-building but most of the writing and world-building is through the lore notes mentioned earlier in the review. If you\u2019re expecting a grand narrative this is not the game for you, but if you want a minimal story that serves its gameplay purposes and stays out of the way of the player, then the story is perfect for you.\n\nMultiplayer is also serviceable. Playing multiplayer with Steam can be done with Steamworks and GOG players can use Galaxy. However, there is also the option of playing with people on the same network using LAN and the option of forwarding your ports and playing without Steamworks and Galaxy. So multiplayer in the game can never truly die since you\u2019re self-hosting. There are no leaderboards or other features like that. It\u2019s just playing with other players and it\u2019s worked well from my experience with no bugs or lag issues.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the ARPG genre, I would recommend this game to you. If you\u2019re a fan of singleplayer-focused ARPGs like Titan Quest and Diablo 1-2, then I would highly recommend it to you. It is good enough to compete with Diablo 2 and is better than the vast majority of games in the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1735530221, "timestamp_updated": 1735530221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495867758989334106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184182406": {"recommendationid": "184182406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817441729", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1735819036}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8c6a\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1735529462, "timestamp_updated": 1735529462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184181154": {"recommendationid": "184181154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349307031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 4385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1975, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1737266718}, "language": "russian", "review": "So much better than Diablo", "timestamp_created": 1735528301, "timestamp_updated": 1735528301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184177917": {"recommendationid": "184177917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096603218", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1736158143}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6839\u672c\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1735525397, "timestamp_updated": 1735525397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184177534": {"recommendationid": "184177534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202560632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 711, "playtime_at_review": 2851, "last_played": 1737328080}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game for that Diablo-type fix without all the micro transactions and hype.

But had to change a few things), seems like the tl;dr is:\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n- It was made with the Titan Quest game engine so it's an easy to log and play game to many. UI is very familiar here and there with some new additions.\n- You don't need to focus on a ton of moves/skills/abilities to get a build working. This is a massive flaw with a lot of ARPGs, specially that ones that force players to play with 4-5 with forced cooldowns as if you were playing piano. The option still exists here for players that like that tho, and having more options is always a positive thing!\n- Alternative builds are possible with components (you can see them as enchants or runes) that provide skills. This gives you some freedom to build the unexpected (I'm enjoying a lot a Nova build!) and you can even start making them very early in the game!\n- Flaws that exist with gear progression on Titan Quest seem fixed here. Game provides better items all the time so you don't depend on shops or specific bosses for them at 100% (even if some monsters have certain specific drops, you can still find alternatives here and there all the time). You can simply play the game and once in a while some options appear that are at least a tiny bit better than what you use somehwat. Thanks to that, you can actually do content a few levels above you perfectly fine (Exploring every single corner of the map? Hell Yeah!).\n- The Faction idea is cool, although with some flaws (check Bounties below).\n- [i]That[/i] Giant exists here too! If you played Titan Quest, you know what I'm talking about :p\n- Lots of secrets, things to do, and side-quests to find! Even after 40 hours I'm still finding new stuff to do,  outside of the main quests, because of NPCs, side-quests, and zones that I find later.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n- Music is a tiny bit repetitive. While it's good, it gets old after a while if you explore every single corner of the map while listening to the same thing all the time.\n- Bounties, one of the things unlocked with factions, are a pain in the ass to unlock and to complete. They take way too much time without checking the wiki, which ruins a lot the idea behind them.\n\nAmazing game!

opinion. Simple enough to get into and enough complexity to tinker with class builds and gear loadouts without going too mental.\n184hrs into the game and I've completed the base game once because I end up wanting to try out different multi-class combos etc! The DLCs are well worth the price.\nThe game's story isn't massively complex, the vast majority of the lore comes across in the forms of \"notes\" that really develop the story if you want to read them. Otherwise its a case of \"fight your way to this guy and kill them\", but rinse and repeat across the campaign. That sounds like a criticism but I find it doesn't make a difference, I've enjoyed it all. Combat is visceral and satisfying and the Hardcore (one life, permadeath) mode is an excellent challenge. \nThe achievements require hundreds of hours to get so worth the grind in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1735126385, "timestamp_updated": 1735126385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183642174": {"recommendationid": "183642174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002424542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 88, "playtime_at_review": 1247, "last_played": 1736571707}, "language": "english", "review": "Got about $100 worth of fun out of a few bucks sale price.

What an amazing game! I've never really played this style of ARPG before but my god what a thrilling and captivating game so far! The atmosphere is spectacular, the combat is simple enough to learn but still creates enough of a challenge where each scenario requires strategy and planning. The story so far is fun and voice acting is great, and again I can't get over how beautiful this game is!\n\n I've spent a long time looking for an RPG with a compelling story, in depth and vast lore, cool creatures and monsters, while still giving off the true RPG vibe in the sense the player has control of outcomes and questlines. Something that's seems simple at first glance but is truly endless and infinite in its replayability. If that is the sort of game you're looking for, Grim Dawn is that game! And it only takes up 5 GB of storage (pre-dlc) which is an absolute steal for the amount of content you're getting. Take advtantage of the 90% off sale no matter who you are because you will not be disappointed. Even at full price this game is worth it.

Lo que te permite centrarte en disfrutar del juego en lugar de pasar horas aprendiendo a jugar.\n6)El modo campa\u00f1a es muy muy entretenido y con much\u00edsimas horas de juego. Si no quieres jugar el PvP no te hace falta.\n7)Lo m\u00e1s complicado tal vez sea entender los items del juego\u00a1, como sacarles ventaja... Pero poco a poco se va entendiendo. A\u00fan as\u00ed no es necesario ser un experto entre las muchas m\u00e9tricas que hay dentro del juego entre items y personaje...solo con entenderlas por encima es suficiente.\n\nRecomiendo much\u00edsimo comprar este juego para apoyar a sus desarrolladores, aun que solo sea el juego base.\n\nPARA EL EQUIPO DE DESARrOLLADORES:  Mejorar el apartado gr\u00e1fiso de todo el juego y de los efectos en combate, ya que existe una opci\u00f3n de jugar en \"calidad Ultra\" que por lo menos se note y podamos apreciar esa gran calidad gr\u00e1fica para loa que nos gusta disfrutar del apartado gr\u00e1fico\n\nEnglish Version:\n\nThe game is really good, seriously you have to give it a chance even if you think this type of game won't appeal to you... believe me, you'll like this one, and it's very addictive. I've been playing for hours and hours without realizing it.\n1) The graphics are decent, nothing out of this world (hopefully they improve the graphics).\n2) The gameplay is good on PC; you only need keys to launch attacks, but not to move, you do that with the mouse.\n3) The whole game is designed so you don't have to move the camera, and if you want to, you can, but it's not necessary.\n4) You can level up quickly in the game.\n5) Unlike other games, this one is very easy to understand, meaning the learning logistics are very quick. This allows you to focus on enjoying the game instead of spending hours learning how to play.\n6) The campaign mode is very, very entertaining with many hours of gameplay. If you don't want to play PvP, you don't have to.\n7) The most complicated thing might be understanding the items in the game, how to take advantage of them... but little by little, you get it. Even so, it's not necessary to be an expert in the many metrics within the game between items and character... just understanding them superficially is enough.\n\nI highly recommend buying this game to support its developers, even if it's just the base game.\n\nFOR THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM: Improve the graphics of the entire game and the combat effects, since there is an option to play in \"Ultra quality\" that should at least be noticeable so we can appreciate that great graphic quality for those of us who enjoy the visual aspect.\n", "timestamp_created": 1735097444, "timestamp_updated":

I love the set pieces within its environments, the level design and sense of continuous gradual exploration uncovering the secrets, plot twists & the history of its world, and Grim Dawn has some of the best writing/storytelling in pretty much any ARPG out there even to this day. \nThe soundtrack is great, the bosses and skill trees and systems within the game are fun and in-depth, and the developers are still active providing the community updates with commonly requested features and addressing bug fixes even well after 7-8 years past release. We're also going to be getting an entirely *new* expansion later in 2025 with a new zone, storyline, and class! There is a lot of love and passion for the genre being put on display by the devs that's evident here and a shocking lack of greed being shown here too. This is *not* a ladder-climbing, season-pass chasing, competitive always-online ARPG -- Grim Dawn is meant to be enjoyed for its' core mechanics, narrative and level design rather than online balancing/trading that's commonplace in most ARPGs these days and I appreciate that very much, and much prefer playing the game solo as well. \n\nIt is a bit dated on the graphics front due to a smaller team and budget compared to its competition, but as far as any visual downsides go I personally think the vanilla game looks fine as-is to this day and has a charming enough art style. Regardless, I would still highly recommend checking out GrimTex mods (Nexus) and other various reshade/texture mods on Crate's forums or on Nexus for the sake of curiosity. \n\nGenerally, for most if not essentially all of the systems within the game, the mod support for this game is fantastic! You can add custom bosses, environments, classes, quests, tweak systems within the game and so much more -- the level of freedom and agency Crate Entertainment has provided Grim Dawn's players with here is awesome.\n\nYou can commonly find Grim Dawn and its expansions on sale, with the base game going as low as like, $3 bucks a lot of the time. The expansions also are *very* worthwhile! There's really no excuse not to try it out if you have previous experience with ARPGs, or have been wanting to try out an ARPG for the first time.

Controllers are abhorrent, with cursors being invisible, face buttons not showing regardless of rescaling UI as well as the fact the controls are extremely buggy with a controller. A fix online was to simply change the controller set which would help in displaying the face button prompts but that would whack out the controls and exaggerate the invisible mouse cursor. \n\nMoreover, a temporary fix is to reschedule the right trackpad to mouse however this game was not designed to work using both a mouse and a controller at the same time, making it gruesome to navigate as half the UI disappears as it is laid out differently for MKB or Controller. \n\nTLDR; There is no way to play this game comfortably with a controller; especially on handheld consoles as this issue persists on the ROG Ally as well.
