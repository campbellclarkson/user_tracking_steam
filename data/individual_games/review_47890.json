is time to do one.\n\nLet me start & say I am Disabled,\nmy mind is more a child I see's things different despite the adult age number, \nI am not great at grammer & I do not do short reviews,\nI stink at properly getting my thoughts out with tiny reviews..\nespecially when a dev/company Like Electronic Arts has upset me ..\n\nI may get a tad uppity (upset) in parts,\nthis game & EA have caused me so many headaches & upsets over the course of the series & years I have played I have finally had it...\nNever wanted to do a review for Sims but if im gonna do one its gonna be the one I love the most.\n\nThe Sims 3.\n\nShort end of stuff:\nI do Not recommend The Sims 3 game especially if you have a Steam Deck on Linux default OS unless you have alot of patience, \npatience to mod, Patience to read tons of tutorials or just to deal with lag, \ncrashes & error codes & eventually losing your legacy's to issues as that will happen with this game.\nIts all a facade the first couple hours it runs stable but you will notice the lag in areas from  the start like Create a style or Create a sim.\n\nI do not recommend Any Sims game in general as EA doesn't care about its players fully,\nthey only care to do everything they can to milk the name & make money,\nthen when the game isn't making enough monies they leave it broken & move on to a new Sims series Sims 2 was left with a Pink Soup texture issue that can  occor longer play sessions, Sims 3 with its lag, errors & crashing & eventually Sims 4 will meet the same fate.\n\nI recommend looking into Paralives & Inzoi that are coming 2025.\nboth have a color wheel; Let you be creative they both look to change so much & both look to actually want to listen to there community!\nParalives in specific looks to change the Life Simulation game in general with free updates free DLC content..\n\n\nSims has been one of my attachment games sense my mom got me into Sims 1,\nbeing disabled I cant do alot, so I like Life Simulation games where I can experience stuff live out things I cant ever do in real life..\n\nI mainly Played Sims 2 the most.\nMoved to Sims 3 for a few years when I got a laptop & one of my humans gave me the near complete disc collection missing some SP packs,..\nI used mods to make it stable, being windows it was easier to situate.\n\nI moved to Steam Sims 3 when I got my Steam Deck & Getting Mods to work on Linux Steam Deck is not easy at all.\nSims 3 in general without performance mods is laggy, crashy & error happy..\n\nbut The Sims 3 was the last good Sims we have that is indepth, not lazy & just made right,\nyes it started to get greedy..it was a sign of things going downhill for the series but it held its ground for the most part.\n\nI have less packs then I did before on Windows, I am running Steam digital Sims 3, Ambitions, Pets, Seasons & Generations.\nI have tried to play with no mods no store stuff..see no difference honestly.\n\nwhile its smooth in game play for a bit its terrible lag/freezes in Create a style (color wheel tool) can push one away fast..\n\nif you dont use Sims 3 create a style tool your looking at less issues for a bit, depending on how many packs u are loading.\nover time as u play the main game will start to lag, fill up with bloat & crash.\neventually getting error 12 code & sometimes not loading in,\n\nSims 3 is still using 32 bit code  meaning it cant really utilize all of our pc's modern specs or ram it needs a 64 bit update,\non top of fixing things..seeing how the mac 64 version went it needs a remake or a proper fixing...\n\nit can only use 4gb max atm & even then getting that to work on steam deck is a hassle as u can't just patch the EXE,\nlike you could on windows as Steam is using Linux with proton for window fixes..\n\nYou will need the Smooth Patch, \n4GB exe ram patch, \nwill need to look into tutorials for fixing things, \nNraas mods, \nhouse boat lag fix from mod the sims..\nprob many others just to fix performance alone..\n\nThough if you can put up with all the fixing all the issues it has:\nSims 3 is the best Sims we have atm.\n\nits more indepth with its features.\nSnow has depth its not flat paint you can actually lose your child in the snow lol,\nSims 3 has a color wheel so no buying hundreds of packs like in Sims 4 just to get a few new swatchs that work with only that packs items..\nThe color wheel works for nearly everything including hair & clothing, Making The Sims 3 the most creative sims to date.\n\nthere is more objects that can be used like phones, the Teleporting nonsense seen in Sims 4, is minimal if any in Sims 3.\ncars that can be driven, bikes & jetskies to have & can be use.\nwith more expansions you can run hotels, can explore tombs, go to the future! like this game has so much in it.\nYou can even have houseboats to build & they can be driven..\nthere is open worlds no loading screen junk you got like a couple loading screens here & there but nothing as bad as Sims 4,\nYou have horses to ride around the open world..\ntiny pets to collect, on top of gems, fish from fishing, crops to grow depending on your packs there is alot of gameplay to be had.\nactions are carried out without major issues or delays,simulation lag is not a thing with Sims 3 but is with Sims 4..\njust everything in Sims 3 is more detailed, packs actually feel worth there price tag.\nSome occults are done better in Sims 3 over 4 like Mermaids.\nSims 3 I feel has way better traits.\n\n\nThough there is So much good..Sims 3 has its bad..\nSims 3 your dealing with lag, crashes, error codes, bugs & issues.\nElectronic Arts & The Sims game gave up on Sims 3 left it broken & still sell it for a high price.\ncause EA has the habit of pushing there games till they break then just dropping support & moving to the Next Sims game...\n\nwhile others state Sims 3 is playable on deck,\nthat is only if you have the patience,\nthe patience to wait as the create a style tool lags & then hard freezes at times,\nthe patience to start a whole new legacy when  error 12 occurs..\nthe patience to deal with game freezes & stuttering as you play long sessions..\nthe patience to deal with crashes that can happen at any point losing hours of play as it doesnt auto save properly without a mod.\nthe patience to get mods to work, to get the launcher to work on deck which is a whole hassle in itself.\nyou can't even install Sims 3 pack easily with Steam deck.\nits a whole juggle to run this game ever sense moving from a windows laptop & Disc Sims 3 I have spent more time trying to fix the lag & issues with Sims 3 & my Steam Deck, Sims 3 needs Patience, Something I do not have.\n\n\nI can't recommend Sims at all anymore, a series I once loved has sank to pure greed..\n\nHonestly I feel if they do not fix up Sims 3 with the hinting January Nostalgia thing its over for me I will move on to Paralives & Inzoi, \na fresh start & adventure that I hope allows me to finally have a proper life sim game where I can create a legacy,\nfinally do things I have wanted to do in Sims games but haven't been able to do cause of issue after issue or missing features..\nsure those are Early Acess but I have more hope in them then I have now for Sims & Electronic Arts.\n\nGo look into Paralives & Inzoi, they are gonna be similar to Sims & a prob much better as a plug & play experience without having to spend hours researching how to fix issues or what mod to download to add back X/Y feature..\n\nSims & Electronic Arts are gonna drown the Sims games with DLC & updates till they no longer run right,\nOnly fix so much, then when it stops being profitable they will drop it broken & all & move on to the Next Sims idea.\n\nThey Do not care they leave the Sims 3 up in its broken state to scam players & use that money to put towards Sims 4..", "timestamp_created": 1737144288, "timestamp_updated": 1737144288, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1,

you\u2019ve ever played it, you know the truth: you are the antagonist. You\u2019re not some benevolent god guiding your Sims toward happiness. No, you\u2019re the puppet master of chaos, poking, prodding, and occasionally trapping your virtual subjects in a series of absurd, tragic, and downright cruel situations\u2014all for your own amusement.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to recognizing and fully embracing your villainous role in The Sims 3:\n\n1. The Illusion of Free Will\nYour Sims think they have autonomy, with their quirky traits, whims, and ambitions. But let\u2019s be real\u2014none of that matters. You override their desires at every turn. That Sim who dreams of being an astronaut? They\u2019re now a kleptomaniac stylist. The one who craves true love? Sorry, they\u2019re doomed to a loveless existence in a house with no doors. Their lives are not their own\u2014they\u2019re yours to toy with.\n\n2. The Architect of Their Misery\nThe power of Build/Buy Mode makes you a godlike force in your Sims\u2019 lives. You could create a cozy dream home\u2014but where\u2019s the fun in that? Instead, you design labyrinthine mansions with no bathrooms, pools with no ladders, and basements where Sims mysteriously disappear after a visit. Your creativity knows no bounds when it comes to their suffering.\n\n\n3. Exploiting Their Weaknesses\nSims are programmed with predictable behaviors and flaws, and you exploit them at every opportunity. Did your Sim just autonomously walk outside during a thunderstorm? You laugh and let it happen. Did they inherit the \"Clumsy\" trait? Time to send them on a tightrope walk over a pit of fire (figuratively, of course\u2014unless you have mods).\n\n\n4. Turning Life Into a Soap Opera\nRomance and family? Ha! You\u2019re here to stir up drama. Your Sim doesn\u2019t need a stable relationship\u2014they need a love triangle, an affair with the maid, and a rival who just happens to \"accidentally\" burn their house down. Every family gathering becomes an opportunity for chaos, and every marriage is one poorly-timed flirtation away from implosion.\n\n\n5. Immortal Torture\nSims fear death, but you don\u2019t fear Grim. In fact, you summon him regularly, sometimes just to chat. But even death isn\u2019t the end for your Sims\u2014you can bring them back as ghosts, zombies, or mummies and continue the torment. Eternal rest? Not on your watch.\n\n\n6. The Puppet Master of Generations\nYour cruelty doesn\u2019t end with one Sim\u2014it spans generations. Legacy challenges are your playground of torment, where you saddle Sims with cursed traits, force them into careers they hate, and control every aspect of their lives for decades. You\u2019re not just a tyrant; you\u2019re an eternal tyrant.\n\n\n7. Mods: Tools of Absolute Power\nMods take your villainy to new heights. With mods, you can inflict even more chaos: alien invasions, supernaturally convoluted love lives, or the ability to turn every Sim in town into a zombie apocalypse. If the base game isn\u2019t cruel enough for you, mods let you truly ascend as the ultimate antagonist.\n\nYou might tell yourself you\u2019re playing The Sims 3 to \"guide\" and \"help\" your Sims, but deep down, you know the truth. You are the villain of this story\u2014a capricious, omnipotent force of chaos who exists to laugh at their struggles and marvel at their resilience. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the true joy of The Sims 3 isn\u2019t creating a perfect life\u2014it\u2019s watching it all fall apart.", "timestamp_created": 1736647166, "timestamp_updated": 1736647166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684895813465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185390721": {"recommendationid": "185390721", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089140450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1736650268}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game i remember having sims 3 pets on my xbox 360. spent 20 on game and 20 on pets dlc and it wont load a game keeps coming up with server error restart applicant i have restarted app and pc 7 or 8 times and nothing plus my saved game from yesterday is gone. dont waste your money one this. on the plus side i didnt pay the 200 on all dlc package like i planned tonight.just spent 3 hours and cant open it i want my fudging money back", "timestamp_created": 1736635844, "timestamp_updated": 1736644336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534643232822418213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185359882": {"recommendationid": "185359882", "author": {"steamid": "76561199816902898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1395, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1737339903}, "language": "english", "review": "better than 4 has actual mapping", "timestamp_created": 1736611066, "timestamp_updated": 1736611066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185340017": {"recommendationid": "185340017", "author": {"steamid": "76561199631002587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 644, "playtime_at_review": 763, "last_played": 1736705302}, "language": "polish", "review": "super grafika oraz gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1736594126, "timestamp_updated": 1736594126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185324297": {"recommendationid": "185324297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080602071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "playtime_at_review": 2070, "last_played": 1737343840}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] APPROACH WITH CAUTION [/h1]\r\n\r\nmy god, this game is held by Spit and rubber bands. i'm not joking.\r\ngeting this thing to work was a headache. so if you're expecting an easy instalation of this, stay far away from this game. you have been warned.\r\n\r\nif you're still here... then lemme give you the procedure:\r\nyou gotta discover your Videocard ID in the Graphics card log file in the documents file of your pc, and ADD to the graphics card file under the Bin folder of the game using notepad++ the second string (asuming it is from a big vendor like NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel, if not you gonna have to add both strings to your graphics cards file, Vendor, and the Card-ID-Card nade), so the game gets to detect your videocard. you also need to mess with the graphics rules file to up the VRAM available for the game so it runs within your modern machine spec. and even after that, you gonna need ALL (and i cannot stress enough, ALL) of NRASS mods, Smoth patch, Isla paradiso routing fix, houseboat helm fix, and a LOT more just to get this game up and running.\r\n\r\nhave i made the dreamlauncher to work? Yes. but only for a Minute, and the game .exe decided to not to work. so what was something to make life easier gave me more headaches. (and i don't blame the creator of that launcher here. it opens and works, but the game doesn't launch with it, given, again that the game is assembled with spit and rubber bands), so back to square one.\r\n\r\nphew. okay. so after all that, is the game worth it?!\r\nsurprisingly, YES IT IS. the gameplay is super engaging. and i spent more hours than i should building homes, apartments, sims from various tv shows, and now am doing a ridiculous dificult challenge (turning all sims of Isla Paradiso into mermaids, no family change allowed, and only cheat allowed is the one to immediately buy the Mermadic Kelp/permanent mermaid upgrade once i get one of my descendents to marry a sim outside the household). there is a lot of fun to be held in this game.\r\n\r\nit is just a shame that this game is so BADLY optimzed by EA and still is sold at this ridiculous price (BRL 75+375 for all expansions in 2025. the price of a new game.). don't get me wrong, the game is fantastic, and one of the last works of the original Maxis team we all know and love, but EA could and honestly SHOULD make this game playable out of the box if they gonna sell it. it is not that hard.\r\n\r\nGame:10/10\r\nFinal Score:7/10\r\n\r\ni [b]CANNOT [/b] for the life of me recommend this for anyone who just expects this to work perfectly out of the box. it will not, and CANNOT. if you got a \"too modern\" pc even (Alder Lake CPU, Aka Intel 12000 series or over, you still need to get another patch for it to work. thankfully my I7 8700 runs it without that. but it is the final shoryuken to the face we get from EA with this game). i am just recommending IF, and only IF, you got patience and know-how to make this game run and giving a thumbs up because this is the game we want, not the DLC simulator Sims 4 is. seriously, on SALE, that thing costs 3000 with all DLCs, and the game has a stroke with all the content installed.\r\n\r\nurgh...

Sendo a sequ\u00eancia de The Sims 2, o t\u00edtulo \u00e9 amplamente considerado por muitos como o melhor e possivelmente insuper\u00e1vel jogo da franquia... n\u00e3o fosse pelos problemas t\u00e9cnicos.\n\n[h2][b]Gr\u00e1ficos/Arte[/b][/h2]\n\n Ao abordar a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte em The Sims, \u00e9 evidente que The Sims 4, sendo o t\u00edtulo mais recente, apresenta a melhor qualidade gr\u00e1fica. No entanto, os gr\u00e1ficos de The Sims 3 revelam um cuidado adicional que, embora sejam considerados inferiores, ainda preservam detalhes expressivos, mesmo que sutis. Um exemplo not\u00e1vel \u00e9 a textura dos personagens, que evita a apar\u00eancia de uma cera, permitindo que caracter\u00edsticas como a marca\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00fasculos sejam visivelmente destacadas, dando uma vivacidade maior.\n\n[h2][b]Trilha Sonora[/b][/h2]\n\n De forma incontest\u00e1vel, The Sims 3 possui a melhor OST entre todos os t\u00edtulos da franquia, sendo especialmente marcante para os nost\u00e1lgicos. Sua trilha sonora \u00e9 uma das mais emblem\u00e1ticas e cl\u00e1ssicas no universo dos jogos, deixando um impacto duradouro nos f\u00e3s que jogaram na inf\u00e2ncia.\n\n[h2][b]Gameplay[/b][/h2]\n Quando experimentei The Sims 3 em meu Xbox 360, o jogo parecia bastante limitado, e eu acreditava que essa limita\u00e7\u00e3o permanecia at\u00e9 os dias atuais. No entanto, ao jogar a vers\u00e3o para PC, fiquei positivamente surpreso. A quantidade de conte\u00fado dispon\u00edvel proporciona a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel alcan\u00e7ar, sem dificuldade, 50 horas de jogo. Infelizmente, The Sims 3 marca o in\u00edcio de uma decad\u00eancia em termos de aten\u00e7\u00e3o aos detalhes, ainda que a imers\u00e3o se mantenha. Um exemplo disso \u00e9 a aus\u00eancia da anima\u00e7\u00e3o de entrada nos ve\u00edculos, substitu\u00edda por uma simples transi\u00e7\u00e3o instant\u00e2nea, bem como a persist\u00eancia do evento envolvendo ladr\u00f5es \u2014 detalhes que foram completamente abandonados no jogo seguinte...\n\n Apesar dessas quest\u00f5es, The Sims 3 oferece a maior liberdade da franquia, destacando-se pelo mundo aberto. A transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre casas ocorre sem as telas de loading, o que facilita e torna ainda mais pr\u00e1tica a intera\u00e7\u00e3o, como espiar seus vizinhos pela janela. Em alguns mapas, existem linhas de metr\u00f4 que agilizam o deslocamento, embora haja uma chance de seu Sim ser furtado durante o trajeto (um bom detalhe).\n\n As expans\u00f5es cumprem seus prop\u00f3sitos de forma exemplar, sendo indispens\u00e1veis para enriquecer ainda mais o jogo. Diferentemente de The Sims 4, The Sims 3 oferece conte\u00fado de qualidade em grande quantidade, tornando a experi\u00eancia significativamente mais completa, apesar dos pre\u00e7os.\n\n[h2][b]Fatores t\u00e9cnicos[/b][/h2]\n\n Al\u00e9m da pr\u00e1tica pre\u00e7os abusivos que incentivam o consumo de The Sims 4, a desenvolvedora falhou de maneira grave na otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo, especialmente considerando que se trata de um t\u00edtulo de 32bits e mundo aberto. Diversas corre\u00e7\u00f5es pela comunidade foram criadas com o objetivo de melhorar o desempenho, com muitas delas restringindo as intera\u00e7\u00f5es dos outros Sims n\u00e3o jog\u00e1veis, mas aplicando limita\u00e7\u00f5es que n\u00e3o comprometem totalmente a experi\u00eancia geral. A vivacidade do jogo \u00e9 t\u00e3o bem apresentada, que chega a ponto de os Sims n\u00e3o controlados pelo jogador receberem praticamente a mesma aten\u00e7\u00e3o e complexidade de vida que os Sims pr\u00f3prios, o que, paradoxalmente, afeta negativamente o desempenho.\n\n Quando afirmo que a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 gravemente deficiente, n\u00e3o se trata de drama. O impacto varia de computador para computador, mas, em muitos casos, essas corre\u00e7\u00f5es apenas tornam o jogo jog\u00e1vel, sem solucionar completamente os problemas de desempenho.

"review": "After you go through all the mods that optimize your experience with The Sims 3, the game becomes truly enjoyable. I recently transitioned from The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection to this installment, and I must say, it\u2019s been an incredible upgrade. I had also played \nThe Sims 4, but it didn\u2019t give me the same sense of satisfaction and fun that I\u2019ve found in The Sims 3.  \n\nOne of the standout features of The Sims 3 is its open-world design, which allows you to seamlessly explore neighborhoods without loading screens. This adds a level of immersion that is absent in \nThe Sims 4 and even The Sims 2. Whether you're sending your Sim to the park, the bookstore, or just letting them roam the streets, the freedom is exhilarating and makes the game world feel alive.  \n\nAnother advantage is the deep customization options. \"The Create a Style\" tool allows you to customize every piece of furniture, clothing, and even wallpaper with an endless variety of patterns and colors. This level of personalization makes it feel like your Sims' world is truly unique.  \n\nThe game also shines in its storytelling capabilities. With the introduction of \"Story Progression\", other families in your neighborhood evolve and change on their own, creating a dynamic and unpredictable environment. It adds a layer of realism and complexity to the gameplay that wasn\u2019t present in earlier installments.  \n\nHowever, it\u2019s not a perfect experience right out of the box. The Sims 3 is infamous for its performance issues, such as lag and long loading times. This is where mods become essential. Mods like NRAAS Master Controller or Overwatch help streamline the game, reduce bugs, and improve performance significantly. Once optimized, the gameplay experience becomes smooth and highly enjoyable.  \n\nUltimately, what makes The Sims 3 stand out is its balance between freedom, creativity, and immersion. It feels like a living, breathing world where your Sims can truly thrive. If you\u2019re willing to invest a bit of time in optimizing it, this game can easily become one of the best in the franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1735899635, "timestamp_updated": 1735899690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184614634": {"recommendationid": "184614634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031036106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 165096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19735, "playtime_at_review": 140408, "last_played": 1737404116}, "language": "english", "review": "The Sims 3 expands on the classic game and makes it even better.
