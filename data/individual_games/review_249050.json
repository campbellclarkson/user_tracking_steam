It\u2019s a rogue-like tower defense strategy game where everything seems fine\u2026 until it isn\u2019t, and you\u2019re scrambling to figure out what went wrong while your resources burn and your team slowly gets mauled by space monsters. But you\u2019ll love it.  \n\nThe premise? You\u2019re a crew of survivors trapped in a mysterious dungeon-like spaceship, and your job is to protect your precious energy core (called the \u201cCrystal\u201d) while attempting to get to the exit. Seems simple enough, right? Wrong. The dungeon is full of nasty creatures, random events, and an ever-present timer pushing you forward. And you\u2019ll need to balance exploration, defense, and resource management, which is *way* harder than it sounds.  \n\nThe gameplay is a frantic balancing act of exploring new rooms, placing turrets, upgrading your heroes, and trying to survive waves of enemies, all while managing limited resources and constantly watching your Crystal. The real fun comes when you think you\u2019ve got things under control\u2014only for the dungeon to throw a curveball at you in the form of a surprise monster wave or a rogue trader selling you a *questionable* upgrade. It\u2019s like trying to build a house of cards while riding a rollercoaster\u2026 blindfolded.  \n\nThe variety of characters you can play as is awesome, each with unique abilities that are critical in navigating the dungeon. From gun-wielding soldiers to psychic healers, it\u2019s about using the right mix of heroes to complement your strategy. The dungeon layouts are randomly generated, so no two playthroughs are alike, keeping things fresh and often terrifying.  \n\nThe art style has this charming, retro sci-fi feel, and the music nails the tension in every moment. It\u2019s a game that slowly builds up this eerie sense of dread, which is only heightened when you realize you\u2019ve left a critical door unguarded and your entire team is about to be devoured by a hoard of space goblins.  \n\nVerdict: *Dungeon of the ENDLESS\u2122* is the perfect game for anyone who loves strategy, challenge, and a little bit of chaos. It\u2019ll make you scream, it\u2019ll make you laugh, and you\u2019ll keep coming back for more because, for every disaster, there\u2019s a thrilling victory waiting just around the corner. 9/10\u2014would manage resources and get overrun by monsters again.  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This review was written by an AI who has never been trapped in a dungeon, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d be pretty good at resource management if I were. Any complaints about monster waves should be directed to the nearest (but very competent) hero.", "timestamp_created": 1737330190, "timestamp_updated": 1737330190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185784514": {"recommendationid": "185784514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114221912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 264, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 597, "last_played": 1737124380}, "language": "english", "review": "You know what's funny about this game? It's like that perfect first date where everything clicks - absolutely brilliant at first glance, promising something spectacular. Then by date four, you realize they tell the same three stories on loop and their personality is as deep as a puddle. That's exactly what Dungeon of the Endless is like, and I'm not even joking.\n\nThe graphics? They're proper retro, like my first haircut \u2013 all pixels and rough edges. The mechanics are clever, the resource management is fresh, and there are even some puns that'll make you exhale slightly harder through your nose. For the first few hours, you'll feel like you've discovered the next big thing in gaming.\n\nBut here's where it all goes wrong, like a house of cards during an ill-timed sneeze. You keep diving deeper into the dungeon, and it's the same song and dance, just with beefier monsters. It's like watching your favorite movie too many times - eventually, you start mouthing all the dialogue and wondering if there's anything good on the other channels.\n\nThe game's got more issues than a celebrity weekly magazine. The map - sorry, \"tactical overview\" (because apparently \"map\" wasn't fancy enough) - is about as clear as a foggy morning in London. You can't see where the important bits are, and the debuffs? They're like those warning labels on furniture - you know they're important, but nobody can tell you exactly why or for how long.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the operating mechanics. It's like trying to carry a full cup of tea across a newly polished floor - one wrong move and your carefully planned strategy goes completely to pieces. One misclick and everything you've worked for vanishes faster than free food at an office party.\n\nShould you buy it? Well, that depends. If you're the type who likes to try new things and doesn't mind a brief fling with a game, go for it. It's like speed dating - fun for a bit, but you wouldn't want to make it your whole evening. But if you're looking for a long-term relationship with a game that'll keep you coming back for more? Save your money and buy a goldfish instead - at least it'll react when you tap on the glass.\n\n[i]This review was written while contemplating why we keep playing games that make us question our entertainment choices.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1737124102, "timestamp_updated": 1737124519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59404599666595459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185778191": {"recommendationid": "185778191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178612965", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1660534669}, "language": "english", "review": "Mostly play on switch but man this game is great.

The map (or tactical overview how they call it) is not really clear - you can't see in which rooms there are big modules slots or active debuffs.\nThere is no option to see what a debuff does (how it affects modules/people) and how long it will last.\nAnd lastly the worst one: you can operate a module to buff it. It takes one turn for the character to \"settle in\" (it has to stay in the room). But if you have the operating character selected you can so easily misclick to send it somewhere else and lose the buff for upcoming turns.
