Solid 6.7 out of 10 installment accounting for age. It's a Sonic game so the soundtrack alone mostly makes up for that, and like any good Sonic game it has a sound test. Some of the bonus tracks are looped badly but you'll get over it.\r\n\r\nIt's a game that's entirely fair to just play to the end credits and shelf it, but it's [i]possible[/i] to get good at playing, and feel like you're getting good at it, if you're invested enough to overcome the jank. There is so, so, so much jank. The designers are entirely aware of what they did and lean into it in places; most of the series since SA2B has some form of \"hard mode\" backroom where the level designers look you in the eye and empty an entire pepper shaker of jank on your plate and make you eat it like a dog.\r\n\r\nSome of what's here really earns that 6/10. i'm not a huge fan of how sluggish the vertical 3D parts are, or how fiddly the on-rails 3D parts are, or how floaty the 2D parts are, or the transitions between 3D/2.5D/2D sections, or the sporadic lack of control precision when it matters. Boss fights often feel like you're interacting by putting notes in a suggestions box and hoping they get acted on. Final boss in particular feels like you're controlling the game with a 5 second stream delay and nothing seems to do anything until it does and you can't figure out why.\r\n\r\nEvery \u201cModern\u201d game in this franchise i've played (besides Mania, which isn't really Sega's work) has a secret, miserable post-game megaboss you have to beat for 100% completion: the menu system. The online/time-attack mode in this one is extra painful and if you want that simple-looking \"play all levels in time attack\" achievement, you [i]will[/i] spend more time waiting for screens of text to load than actually playing the levels. The chevo for no-hit final boss requires you to repeatedly precision-QTE-mash through 8 seconds of loading and fmv screens to retry, or worse get to the end in a fail state and have to hold skip for 2 minutes in the credits - a successful run requires iterating like this to develop clairvoyant Hidden Object Game skills to even understand what's happening on screen, because see above paragraph about the total lack of feedback. It's almost a rite of passage that the game makes you navigate these dark corners, but it's so unnecessary. Could've been executed much better.\r\n\r\nFor all its warts, i don't regret grinding out 100% completion at all. The gallery room is cool.

I was hoping a seamless experience y'know like 60 fps capped with no fps drop but MAN this game, by itself, has A LOT of stuttering when I play as Modern Sonic (and Classic Sonic sometimes). The game is fun when the player moves fast and it kinda is the whole point of the game. However, the stuttering can get way too distracting at certain times. There is that one time I lost the timing on a jump that made me fail to get the S rank in that one city level (I forgot the name). \n\nAlso, SEGA, why did you delist the game from steam? I get that you want people to buy the new and shiny SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS game, but why remove the original? Personally, I don't think that putting the game only available to buy in a bundle that costs Rp 673 200 (around 50 USD) and not putting it up for sale individually is a great idea. Maybe I just don't get it. You do you SEGA, you do you.\n\nOverall, I think that the game here is still fun in a way that is still jank (other reviewers may point that out). The levels are super fun, challenging and a nice tribute to older Sonic games in general. And the music, like, THE MUSIC is GOATED man. The Sonic Team really nails the music part of this game especially the one from Speed Highway that one is my fav. \n\nTry the original one if you really don't mind buying the bundle.

Sonic 4 episode 2 is overpriced, but fine enough. However, Sonic 4 Episode 1 is a complete [b] trash-tier [/b] videogame and not even worth a fraction of its price. They should be PAYING [i] you [/i] to play it. This bundle just exists to get you to pay for both Sonic 4 eps. Their collective price really inflates the cost of the whole bundle. This collection of games just isn\u2019t worth it at this price. Wait for a 25% sale or something. At least then you can take it as an opportunity to buy Adventure 1 and 2, if you haven\u2019t already. \n\nIf you Just wanna play generations, and are willing to pay upwards of 50? Just get SxS Gens. It\u2019s the complete package, and has the best new Sonic experience since the OG Generations in 2011. \n(in light of how much i dislike this bundle, i probably should have made my review negative, but i just couldn't do that to Generations)\n\n[h3] This game Is one of the greatest 3d platformers ever made [/h3] and I played it to near death on my series x (it has a 60fps boost on there). There\u2019s 11 awesome levels (not Planet Wisp) with 2 main \u2018acts\u2019 each, with a bunch of bonus levels and bosses for each area. By mixing the boost gameplay and classic gameplay, each level feels distinct from one another and are all worth individual replays. Sure, there\u2019s a bit much 2d, but it tends to serve the levels well, as most levels are superbly paced and tightly designed, to the point where you can easily play a level for hours and hours and still discover better routes (I only recently learned that you can run across the water at the start of seaside hill to reach a shortcut). \n\nOn average, this game may take 5-7 hours to complete the main levels, and maybe 15 hours if you wanted to complete everything. Considering just how short and sweet each level is, that completion time is definitely worth shooting for. And between the dozens of great stage mods (namely, the Unleashed project), you can easily clock hundreds of hours into this. On that note, it is definitely worthwhile to get this version of the game, old as it may be (i mean, it\u2019s got a crusty launcher). Y\u2019see a lot of the older mods may never be ported to the new Sonic gens remaster, \u2018cos a lot of modders have probably left the scene since their mods were created.

bundles which will probably costs you 50 or 100$ so whether or not you wanna do is upto you. This was in favour of the fact Sonic X Shadow Generations already had this game + second Shadow campaign. \n\nThis shouldn't go without saying, but I highly recommend playing this game with a controller. I mean playing it with a keyboard is fine, but it's just smoother to play with a controller. Also make sure, to get a good quality one, certain controllers just suck because it causes 3D Sonic to just swing left constantly for some reason.\n\n[h1] The gameplay [/h1]\n\nthis game is split into to sections\n\nModern Sonic - he has the boost formula, and of course his signature homing attack. His part is easily the best part of the game it's fun, and it makes you feel fast. He also has his 2D sections which personally, is better than Classic Sonic stages for me. \n\nClassic Sonic - he plays like he did in the Genesis games, but for me personally, he just feels odd. He doesn't feel like how he did in the Genesis games, however he's still fun to play as his own thing and better than he was in Forces. \n\nThe bosses of the game are fun too, I like  Silver and Metal Sonic. \n\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\nIt's a Sonic game, so of course the music slaps. My favorite is City Escape Act 1. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe story of this game is simple, a creature kidnaps Sonic and his friends, and it's your job to save the day again with Sonic and past Sonic. \n\n[h1] Customizablity [/h1]\n\nThis game has mods, and a lot of them so after you're done playing the campaign and 100%ing the game you can still replay the game because of what the modding community offers.\n\n\n\n[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]\n\nThis game is actually very very solid, and it's very fun. It's a shame you really can't get it anymore, but hey if you wanna get it you  can just buy the bundles, or get it's remake with Shadow X Sonic Generations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736043730, "timestamp_updated": 1736043730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184789263": {"recommendationid": "184789263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010891349", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1737067670}, "language": "english", "review": "this one is easily the best sonic game ive played so far - the classic levels are whatever, im not into 2d sonic so i will not comment.\r\n\r\nnearly all the 3d levels are smooth and silky with lots of shortcuts to go faster through the levels once you know how, the only downside is how many times the game grinds to a halt when the 3d levels become 2d, and you have to slowly navigate platforms. this is a chore that hits its peak at the final level (the sonic colors stage), hardly any of this stage is even 3d, it may as well be 2 2d levels\r\n\r\noverall good game if not a little bit too easy as the game plays itself a lot of the time", "timestamp_created": 1736036531, "timestamp_updated": 1736036531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184782434": {"recommendationid": "184782434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339283105", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1736030396}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game overall, perfect entry point into the series.", "timestamp_created": 1736030526, "timestamp_updated": 1736030526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184734508": {"recommendationid": "184734508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212121196", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 243, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1257, "last_played": 1735516264}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Sonic Generations \u00e9 um jogo essencialmente divertido.

Trata-se, sobretudo, de um game pra voc\u00ea se divertir e nisso, o objetivo \u00e9 plenamente atingido.\n\nN\u00e3o d\u00e1 nem pra se falar em enredo/hist\u00f3ria, afinal ele existe apenas como plano de fundo e nem tem como ser diferente. O que d\u00e1 pra se falar \u00e9 da variedade de miss\u00f5es, n\u00edveis e diferentes coisas pra se fazer. Cada miss\u00e3o tem dois tipos de gameplay, o que impede que o jogo se torne ma\u00e7ante.

O jogo constantemente tem queda de frames e travamentos, sem contar que a pr\u00f3pria inicializa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 problem\u00e1tica.\n\nDe toda forma, em quest\u00f5es gerais, Sonic Generations \u00e9 um jogo excelente, que passa muito da sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de inf\u00e2ncia dos jogos cl\u00e1ssicos do Sonic.

So from my understanding this is pretty much a compilation of the best parts of the previous games remade into one game + with some extras of its own. The main levels are all amazing. And the game has dozens and dozens of extra levels. 122 stages in total, which is insane. Although gigantic amount of stages I never got bored. All of those extra stages are parts taken from the main levels with some extra condition added, but do not get fooled, even though you play through the same environments they often altered the layouts or completely changed the gameplay. This is how you reuse levels, so many games do it so lazily, but here all of the reused level design feels like completely new levels. It is truly amazing how much variety there is in those stages. There are a few stinkers there and there though, it would be silly to expect all 122 stages to be good, but to my surprise there are only about 10 bad ones, and usually because they do not have any checkpoints even though they could, and they usually have just a single tight and poorly designed part in them, but it is painful and completely kills the level.\r\n\r\nOne major problem I have with this game is that controls are quite broken, at times unresponsive, do not register my commands. This problem is pretty constant, the biggest offender is auto aim. The distance and angle by with you have to be from the object is very unclear, sometimes I'm nearby the object and there is no aim sign, other times I'm far from the object and there is aim sign. This ended in many deaths. Another problem is how often I confuse straight boosting and aimed jumps, or more precisely how the game forces me to misuse them. This usually happens when I should jump to something aimed, but the game does not register aiming, but when I use boost it jumps to the wrong direction or plain through... Often into an abyss. Walking controls are very odd, at first they are too slow, very clunky and you feel super immobile, but after just a few steps you become too fast and can't control yourself with precision anymore. It uses speed acceleration for movement. It's always either too slow or too fast and could have easily been fixed by having non-increasing walking speed which is of medium speed and you only gain speed by boosting or ramps or ground boosters. About unresponsiveness, sometimes I can see the aim sign, but I still can't jump to it, sometimes you can see it even if you're not close enough which can be annoying, usually happens with bosses.\r\n\r\nBesides movement problems there are also a lot of game breaking glitches. Many times something did not trigger and I had to restart the game for it to work properly. For example, those gears that require gems did not begin to work once I added gems to them. One of them began to spin very slowly (way too slow) and the others did not budge, but after I restarted the game all of them were spinning on the proper speed. All of the game breaking glitches were fixed after restarting the game, so at least that is a solace.\r\n\r\n\r\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1735776127, "timestamp_updated": 1735776127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184467807": {"recommendationid": "184467807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046413432", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1735065346}, "language": "latam", "review": "Un juego memorable sin duda.

I really enjoyed this game since childhood and still like it now but my overall opinion soured a bit after replaying it 100% yet again in the remaster. The plot is pretty simple, nothing that much interesting, though it's weird how Classic Sonic doesn't talk while Classic Tails does. It makes it seem like Sonic was dumber back then. It also adds some loopholes to the lore of the series, mainly the 06's inclusion. \n\nThe stages are very good and feel like true remakes, as if what would've happened if the originals were released today or in 2011. Though Planet Wisp as Normal Sonic is too long. Classic's stages feel good too and are an interesting \"demake\" of the stages from the 3D games. Normal Sonic's physics and controls are better than Unleashed and Colors, though developers can't decide whether he should have a double jump or a jumpdash. And classic is not a perfect one to one port of the physics but good enough. The bosses are also very cool and that's interesting to see how they have their own interpretations of gameplay. However, the final boss is one of, if not the worst Final Boss in the series. \n\nMy main problem though is with challenge gates. If we're talking about beating the game, it's fine to just choose one and go further. But if we're talking 100%, they are very uninspired and to be honest I would've preferred 1 or 2 more stages than all of those missions, as some of them feel like padding, for example the doppelganger ones. The exploration for Red Star Rings was pretty interesting but not to the extent of Colors level design, where some of them had their own areas.\n\nThe PC port is very sub-par and it was unoptimized for it's time. We all know the infamous Configuration Tool error. The tool itself is very barebones and useless essentially. The controller can get buggy if you're not using Steam's emulation of XInput or the XInput controller. At least we can thank this port for one of the most advanced modding scenes in the series. Really interesting move to release it for PC at all after not releasing previous games to the platform for many years. \n\nAs a whole, this game is good but not the best 3D Sonic in the series, like many fans think. You can't call a collection of stages' remakes a best game in the series, it's essentially cheating. But I highly recommend you to play, especially if you are a fan of the previous games.", "timestamp_created": 1735520822, "timestamp_updated": 1735520822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

definitely see that it is a bit older nowadays, the graphics aren't as crisp as you will see in newer titles, but the game itself still plays and looks very good!\n\nIt is very easy and simple to get into aswell, so its a treat for newcomers and veterans alike!\n\nIn this game you play as either modern or classic sonic. While I do prefer the modern style, this games classic sonic isn't too bad, it controls pretty good, even if not perfect compared to the classic 2d games. Definitely plays a lot better than in forces, thats for sure!\n\nThs spindash of classic sonic is very overpowered here and if you jump just after spindashing and hold the stick in just the right direction, you'll be flying over very large portions of the stages. It feels very nice to do so, but it is sad that you don't really see much of a stage that way. The normal gameplay is fun too, so I'd recommend everyone to try and find all the red rings!\n\nThis holds true for modern Sonic aswell, the controls are very nice, though I do gotta say, if you played newer titles, it feels like a doublejump is missing. The stages are made without that in mind though, so its all pretty much just an issue of having gotten used to something even more... heh, modern.\n\nThe stagedesign for both Sonics are nice, I really like the challenges aswell and I think the only way to play this, is to try and get an S rank on everything, it isn't that hard in this game!\n\nYou will definitely have fun playing through this, even

The story is not bad at all considering that they had to create an excuse for those different acts, although the final boss battle is really chaotic the first time you get to it (pro tip: [spoiler]dash all the time and switch to classic only when the boss beams the laser, then return.[/spoiler]).\n\nI'm not a fan of collectables though, the Red Rings were a pain already in Sonic 4 episode 2, and just like that time, I got the chievo thanks to the video tutorials that show exactly where they are located. Friends also give you their location when you talk to them about Red Rings. \n\nPlanet WISP acts are weird until you get used too, specially the classic Sonic stage. That transformation really kills the flow of the game IMO.
