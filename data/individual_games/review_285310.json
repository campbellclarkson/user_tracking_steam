Its 2.5d graphics might be a bit archaic for today's standards but have aged fairly well and can be considered \"retro\" rather than \"dated\", specially in comparison to the 3D ones of the third installment. \nThere is a lot to do in this game and each park provides its own set of challenges that must be overcome in order to reach the desired goals, but as to how you do it, anything goes really, so you can take your sweet time to do it, even if there's a timer for it, don't stress yourself, cause this game is not meant for that but rather to relax. \nI can't pinpoint my exact favorite thing about this first game, that i went in without being nostalgic about it cause i've only played Rollecoaster Tycoon 3 beforehand, but it has it charm and is a good acquisition, specially taking into account its cheap price.\n\nQuick Score:  7/10 (What's holding it back its exactly what it sequel has, the lack of a Scenario Editor)", "timestamp_created": 1735937403, "timestamp_updated":
