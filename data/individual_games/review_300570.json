The only beef I have with it is puzzles feel very samey with only a very small amount of variation as you go on so you'll be using a lot of the same 'tricks' just in a different order.  It initially seems like a game where there's a lot of different ways to do something, but it's more often the case there's one best way to do things and you're just filling in the blanks to do it.  Another minor negative: most of the \"technical challenge\" achievements are very easy to accomplish and don't require specialized designs.  \n\nAll that said, I still enjoyed my time with it and would recommend it to others.
