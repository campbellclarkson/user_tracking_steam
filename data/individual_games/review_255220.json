To me, it's an awesome racing game series that started its roots on awesome damage model with really fast & amazing driving physics & sense of speed, with thrilling soundtrack, an amazing rivalry & team management and sponsors and just overall amazing feeling of progression!\n\nSo which of these does Grid Autosport have? Damage model & racing is pretty good but not nearly better than original. But everything else? Almost nonexistent or scrapped. I do not feel I progress through this game in any meaningful way. The soundtrack is...almost nowhere. Ravenwest is...not as threatening as in other games. Teammates? Can't connect as much as in first game as you're like a driver for hire for other teams. The first game had soul like that, this one not so much. So why did I push through to 100% the career? Gameplay is great & trying all the kinds of races was neat, even if repetitive...but I would not play it again unless paid for a good sum.\n\nI feel like you can enjoy this if you are just looking to race.

From a car nerd perspective, AKA the target audience for this game, GRID Autosport is what GRID 2 should\u2019ve been. I love GRID 2, which does hypercars insanely well, but this is better if you're a car enthusiast since it's a bit more grounded. The physics are incredible, especially for the time but it still holds up better than most games of this type released today. This is a pure celebration of  (mostly European) motorsport. The original GRID is still the best in terms of content, but if you\u2019re after something similar, a bit more modern and with perfect Deck support (even displaying the battery charge level on the top-right while in-game), then GRID Autosport is for you.\n\nThe AI knows how to defend and attack fairly, at least in the context of the motorsports depicted in which contact is mostly allowed and even encouraged in the case of stock/tourer racing. It\u2019s not crazy like in so many other racing games. The cars handle slightly differently than other games I've played in this series, being a lot more stiff at the rear even with \"soft\" suspension, which doesn't suit my usual driving style but I've gained tremendous satisfaction in learning to adapt to that. In some ways, I'd go as far as to say that GRID: Autosport has increased my understanding of real life motorsports drivers (such as Sebastian Vettel) who prefer understeer to oversteer - you can be bloody quick if you keep the revs and gears up despite braking earlier. (No wonder Vettel dropped off after F1 went hybrid.)\n\nPlaying GRID Autosport on a Deck is frankly the best simcade experience I\u2019ve had on that device. Usually I\u2019d need to bump the difficulty down a notch due to not having proper force-feedback etc, but it works here. I\u2019m just as quick as I would be playing on my desktop. When playing on a desktop, however, it makes use of a second screen to display race information, which can be very handy when attempting to manage your teammate. If you're in an important points battle over a season, it is of course invaluable later on.\n\nSadly, this cannot be bought officially anymore due to car brand licensing, but it is surprisingly cheap (less than lunch) if you know where to go, even with all DLCs.\n\nSpeaking of simcades, as a genre label it's far too broad because that would lump the likes of Need For Speed in with GRID and possibly even the F1 games. I propose a new dumb genre name: simulation racing sim.
