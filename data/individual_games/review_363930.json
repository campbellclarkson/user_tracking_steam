The \u201croguelite\u201d elements are incredibly weak, as the only real difference is how leveled-up each character starts. Plus, the \u201cclasses\u201d don\u2019t feel unique - they\u2019re just characters with different skills leveled up, which is pretty underwhelming.\n\n[b]The dungeon crawling is awful.[/b] Enemies are repetitive, and the events are super generic and boring. Crafting feels really underwhelming too since you have to leave someone behind at the base to actually craft anything. On top of that, it\u2019s frustrating how little healing you get after returning from expeditions outside the camp, especially when you have so few characters to use.\n\n[b]Combat is a slog.[/b] I found it really annoying that 90% of the time (at least it felt like 90% of the time), the enemies get to attack before you do - even without an ambush.\n\nThe concept of the game is great: managing a camp while sending characters out to scavenge resources is a cool idea - [i]the game This War of Mine did this masterfully[/i] -, and the turn-based system has potential in this context. But the combat is a total drag, likely because both sides have way too much HP and your moment to moment actions don't feel like they really matter. I get the need for a mechanic that limits dungeon-crawling progress, but games like [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] do it so much better.\n\n[b]Score: 3.5/10[/b] - [i]Mediocre[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1735584656, "timestamp_updated": 1735584903, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517654478549957275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183714548": {"recommendationid": "183714548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133697425", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1734553144}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O combate n\u00e3o \u00e9 bem desenvolvido, o jogo \u00e9 desinteressante e n\u00e3o prende.", "timestamp_created": 1735183838, "timestamp_updated": 1735183838, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 4431, "total_negative": 995, "total_reviews": 5426}, "cursors": {"AoJwguGT74oDeKfZsQQ=": "Mon Jan 20 18:13:22 2025"}}
