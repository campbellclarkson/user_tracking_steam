Star Control vibes here for sure!\r\n\r\nSo, I've owned SPAZ 1&2 for a couple few years now and while i've played a ton of SPAZ 2, I just finally decided to give SPAZ 1 a go!\r\n\r\nI really dig SPAZ 2 and had read a few reviews of people melting down that 2 wasn't the same as 1 (Snappy) and had thought they were off their rockers because 2 is a fun and engaging game.\r\n\r\nWhile i still wholeheartedly disagree with that particular reviewer, I do agree that 1 is a fantastic game on it's own legs!  It IS quite different, (for example you get different complete ships instead of block building, and you can change out engine/reactor/weapons etc like a more traditional space opera type game) but it is just a different but ALSO very good game that follows the same storyline and universe.\r\n\r\nReally fun if you dig these types of games at all, absolutely give them a go!  Read up on the devs a little also, pretty cool 2 man team putting out stellar games.\r\n\r\nIf you guys happen to read this I have to say, I would DEFINITELY buy a 3.  I would buy expansions for both 1 and 2 also! \r\n\r\nFeels like a mash up of the highlights from the two games would make an incredible foundation for a really epic adventure.  I'm looking forward to playing what they release in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1736468226, "timestamp_updated": 1736468226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183770115": {"recommendationid": "183770115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049029095", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1178, "last_played": 1735397384}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0439, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0439, \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439 \u0438 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430!", "timestamp_created": 1735231524, "timestamp_updated": 1735231524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 2794, "total_negative": 279, "total_reviews": 3073}, "cursors": {"AoJwnp3V8f4CdICmowM=": "Mon Jan 20 15:50:33 2025"}}
