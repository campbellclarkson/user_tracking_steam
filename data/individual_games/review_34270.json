As of December 6, 2024, SEGA has removed the entire Mega Drive and Genesis Classics collection from Steam, along with all individual titles. This means that new players can no longer purchase these beloved retro games on Steam, and I won\u2019t be able to play them with friends in the future.\n\nThis action not only restricts access to one of the very nice curated collections of retro games but also disrespects the preservation of gaming history. I have fond memories of these games and valued the ability to revisit them through this collection. Now, future generations are being denied that opportunity unless they turn to expensive physical copies or piracy.\n\nWhile SEGA did provide a one-month notice, this was far too short for fans to react, especially for such a significant delisting. They could have extended the availability period or ensured a more gradual transition, allowing more players to secure these classics. Transparency and a stronger commitment to game preservation should have been prioritized.\n\nSEGA has taken a step backward in supporting its fans and preserving its legacy. This decision deserves criticism.

Even running on a Steam Deck the games can stutter every now and then. If you're one of those who prefers to play Genesis games officially, this would be the way to go if you don't have access to the original console, but if you prefer better quality and don't care about legal issues, I'd recommend going with Genesis GX Plus.
