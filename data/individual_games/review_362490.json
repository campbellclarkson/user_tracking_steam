That\u2019s how long we\u2019ve waited for this game to fulfil its ambitious promises. But after a decade of \"development,\" it's painfully clear that Bare Mettle is more interested in endlessly tinkering with their precious game engine than actually delivering the experience we were promised.\n\nWhat about the core gameplay? It\u2019s still stuck in the same frustrating cycle of clunky controls and rudimentary content. Combat may be physics-driven, but that \"innovation\" comes at the cost of basic responsiveness. Every action feels like controlling a marionette through molasses. The NPC AI? They\u2019re supposedly \"smarter\" and more \"immersive,\" according to the wordy monthly dev posts, but mostly they just bumble around and spout stilted, repetitive dialogue.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the role system. It's been talked about in blog post after blog post, filled with endless jargon about dynamic behaviors and emergent complexity, yet the actual implementation is nothing more than vague, placeholder features. NPCs \"might\" do something, depending on a thousand invisible variables you can\u2019t influence or even track. At best, the system feels half-baked; at worst, it\u2019s incoherent.\n\nMeanwhile, Bare Mettle brags about how they spent months optimizing their cloth physics or refining a new terrain system (wow new tile textures!!!). Sure, it's impressive they can simulate cloth with \"millions of polygons\" or overhaul how grass or cracks in tiles interact with lighting, but none of that matters when your players are still waiting to experience the actual game.\n\nThe bottom line is this: No one buys a game to marvel at the backend of its engine. They buy games for compelling gameplay, engaging stories, and functional mechanics\u2014none of which Bare Mettle has managed to deliver in ten years. At this point, the game is nothing more than a tech demo wrapped in empty promises.\n\nUnless the developers can break their obsessive cycle of endless technical refinement and focus on finishing a product worth playing, this game will go down as one of the most tragic examples of wasted potential in modern indie development.", "timestamp_created": 1736655387, "timestamp_updated": 1736655465,

Watched some YouTube videos & realised I wasn't exactly playing as it was intended.\n\nRe-bought and dumped 10 hours into the Campaign and 2 hours into the Arena. \n\nPros:\n- Combat is unique and enjoyable\n- Companions are a nice touch - although he died. Using Loyalty to Command 3 people was a nice replacement.\n- Skills are actually useful, magic and physical. \n- Maps are well done. Although I didn't realise a few things such as...\n(Compass is actually usable if it's in your inventory, it shows a compass icon in the bottom left of your screen.)\n(There's 1 more consumable other than the Blue Bottles that buff your character)\n- Arena is a nice touch to throw some time into. It's not fantastic, but it's also a good way to learn how to fight. \n\nCons:\n- I didn't realise the campaign wasn't completely released until I cleared Level 8 and had to google where to go, lol. \n- With how dark the levels are it's hard not to just constantly have the Torch out. (Maybe add a Lantern you can hook onto your belt?\n- Companions ALWAYS end up killing one another after bumping into each other. So despite being able to have 3 you're almost better off just have 1 to avoid conflict. \n- The \"Save\" game isn't well explained. (You can EXIT whenever you want - outside of combat - and you will always be where you EXITED from. You can die multiple times and you will only go unconscious until your health bar is completely consumed by RED. Glowing Blue Bottles will recover your HP to 100% but there's only 1 per level.\n- Darren can die. It would be nice if he only went unconscious. Depending on who you are this is a PRO or a CON.\n- The Armour system is slightly weird to get used to. It would be nice if there was a display in your inventory for each part of your body that showed it's defence.

The focus of the game is exploration and combat. I would say this game is actually 2 games in one. The first game is the story mode (clicking \"begin\" in the menu screen), a mode focused on exploration with sparse combat: you will be navigating a maze-like building using your intuition, a compass (if you find one) and sometimes a map, trying to find weapons and gear to survive combat and find clues to what is going on. It is very punishing because dying means losing hours of progress. If you like navigation, exploration and combat, this will be a challeging and fun experience. Just note that the game is not complete, yet very playable, without major bugs. I recommend playing in practice mode first to learn the combat and controls, that are definetely not intuitive nor simple.\r\nThe second game is the arena. Here you fight several types of combat in an arena and can manage several \"gladiators\". It is combat focused with a bit of management. \r\nIn general, the game shines for its innovative combat and magic mechanics. It is worth the price, even if it was just the story mode, or just the arena mode.\r\n\r\nFeedback for developers:\r\nFirst, thank you for making this game. I believe you are bringing innovation to the industry. Please keep the good work. I wish more games could bring new mechanics, or twists in old mechanics, as Exanima does. I personally loved the physics based combat and the magic system (thaumaturgy?). I have been searching for for a hardcore physics-based combat system for some years and this one of two games that satisfied me (the other being \"we who are about to die\"). \r\nI have two main suggestions:\r\n1. Please add more control options. I struggled a lot with moving with RMB and with switching between combat and walking stances. There were situations on which I took free hits because I took me too long to hit \"tab\", as my keyboard hand was not on the keyboard after exploring for 30 min with no combat. I believe a control scheme similar to Project Zomboid would greatly benefit your game: RMB activates the combat stance, instead of tab, and, by default letting go of RMB deactivates it. WASD would become the main input for movement. I think this would work better because in combat WASD is already used as the main source of movement and using RMB to activate the combat stance would make transitioning between combat and walking/running. I think controlling the character with WASD is also more precise, there were several situations on which I tripped, fell or kissed a wall because of controlling the character requires the mouse, even after 10 hours of play. Obviously, this would be added as an option and the player, with the current movement control options still available (although I see no advantage to controlling the PC with the mouse).\r\n2. Please use the physics capabilities of the engine to make exploration more interesting and add more challenges. There were many times that I felt rewarded for removing the lid of a crate and removing random garbage from its insides to find valuable loot inside and many times I felt smart overcoming a hole in the ground by moving objects around. This was only possible because I could physically interact with each item. However I feel like this \"physicallity\" of the game is not fully explored yet. I would like to find fake walls by moving book stands or using magic blasts, more hidden equipment (e.g. under beds) and enemies (e.g. under a bed sheet), put things on fire with lighting blasts, solve physics-based puzzles, and so on. In the current state of the game (Dec of 2024) I feel like everything being interactable is more of a gimmick than something that adds to gameplay.\r\n3. Please add a Thaumaturgy Power to create light. The game is pretty dark and holding a torch limits combat capabilities. Having the power to create light, with obvious costs (continuity slot and focus), benefits (seeing in the dark) and disadvantages (being less stealthy) seems to fit the game perfectly.\r\n4. Please add saving options. I do enjoy hardcore mechanics when they enhance gameplay. I do not think having so few checkpoints in a game with so much focus on exploration enhances gameplay. I felt confused if the focus of the game is having a long-lived character that survives the whole story mode, or several short-lived characters that each contribute to progress, none of them surviving the whole thing (like in Rogue legacy). In the current state of the game dying feels very punishing and adds very little to gameplay. I had to redo a lot of the same things after dying, which made it very repetitive and boring, because I would lose a lot (sometimes hours) of progress. I decided to \"save manually\" (copying the .rsg file) after feeling discouraged by the death mechanics and that improved the experience for me greatly. On the one hand I think the game would make more sense if there were no checkpoints and dying with a character allowed you to keep some of the loot, experience and progress. On the other hand the game would also make more sense if it had more checkpoints (one at every area and locked door entrance?), a way to save via items (like in \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\"), Thaumaturgy, or even in specific places (e.g. shrines). To me, having just a few checkpoints and death being so punishing as it is now is just a way of making players replay the same thing over and over again, which leads to counterproductive frustration. Naturally, this could be an option, with the current death mechanics still available.\r\nI don't know if anyone in the team will read this, but I took the time anyway because I really liked this game, see great potential in it and would like to see it grow and thrive. I only stopped playing due to reaching an invisible wall in the last floor (were I believe will be the entrance to the next floor) and remembering that this is still early access (I don't want to overplay it now to have a fresher experience at launch). I hope you devs take your time to make this the game you really wanted to make and the make it the best it can be.", "timestamp_created": 1735436444, "timestamp_updated": 1735436444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184044273": {"recommendationid": "184044273", "author": {"steamid": "76561199331626004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 343, "playtime_at_review": 2247, "last_played": 1736924309}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best games ive played super unique machanics thank you general sam", "timestamp_created": 1735430924, "timestamp_updated": 1735430924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184015423": {"recommendationid": "184015423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074098630", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "deck_playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1735410639}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0436 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1735410691, "timestamp_updated": 1735410691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483899623155593872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "183847350": {"recommendationid": "183847350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857306300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3877, "last_played": 1735434680}, "language": "english", "review": "As a person who loves fantasy RPGs with more difficult combat fighting, this game is quite a pleasant experience. The dark ambiance makes the game exciting followed by the armor and weapons desings. The difficulty of the game makes the player think about every decision when approaching enemy or exploring the areas, specially since the game has little checkpoints and health recovery options. The arena content is a good way to focus on the combat  and offers enough content to develop your team and acquire the best armor pieces to them. Some downsides of this game is that the combat makes this game difficult to understand at the beginning and difficult to master, such learning curve can make a person drop the game if is not patient enough to keep trying; having long checkpoints also can increase the frustration of a player. While the ambience of the game is well stablished, it's lore can improve giving the player more hints about the events happening in the game. Since this game is still an early access is natural to see some incomplete areas, objects that could be usefult but their used is not implemented yet and more. Right now at it's present state I felt like playing a complete game with enough content, considering it's time and the uniqueness of the combat makes this game a good option to try for every player that likes a different challenge and medieval games.", "timestamp_created": 1735278438, "timestamp_updated": 1735278438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489039838314056396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183843939": {"recommendationid": "183843939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067132205", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 505, "playtime_at_review": 1278, "last_played": 1737095311}, "language": "english", "review": "The greatest mammoth hunting simulator to not have mammoths in it.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, Exanima is a game that has developed ludonarrative harmony.

Um dungeon crawler com um sistema completamente baseado em f\u00edsica. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 anima\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e9-setadas para as a\u00e7\u00f5es, tudo se comporta de forma mais ou menos realista baseada num sistema de manipula\u00e7\u00e3o dos ossos dos modelos 3D e nas regras presentes na engine do jogo. Engine essa que \u00e9 feita pelos pr\u00f3prios devs, o que \u00e9 de se elogiar bastante.\n\nExanima \u00e9 dividido em dois modos at\u00e9 o presente momento, a campanha principal na qual voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma pessoa sem mem\u00f3rias explorando uma masmorra povoada por mortos-vivos. Contanto com as pr\u00f3prias habilidades de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o, combate e observa\u00e7\u00e3o para chegar o mais longe poss\u00edvel nos diversos mapas do jogo. E campanha de combate, no qual voc\u00ea constr\u00f3i seu personagem lutando em diversos tipos de eventos, manejando seu dinheiro, contratando pessoas para sua companhia de lutadores e tentando n\u00e3o morrer.\n\nAmbos os modos tem uma boa profundidade. D\u00e1 pra colocar horas e mais horas e ainda assim n\u00e3o fazer tudo o que o jogo oferece. No momento dessa review eu tenho 10 horas no jogo, o que n\u00e3o foi suficiente pra chegar na metade do segundo n\u00edvel da campanha principal, e nem perto do n\u00edvel m\u00e1ximo que seu personagem pode atingir no modo arena.\n\nDito isso, os controles s\u00e3o a principal coisa que vai afastar os jogadores menos investidos em deixar de lado certas conven\u00e7\u00f5es dos jogos e apreender n\u00e3o um, mas dois sistemas de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o distintos o suficiente pra que voc\u00ea fique confuso na hora de jogar. \n\nO primeiro \u00e9 o sistema de explora\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 basicamente um controle de tanque. Esquerda e direita giram o eixo do seu personagem e pra frente e pra tr\u00e1s movem ele. \u00c9 estranho de in\u00edcio, mas depois de uma ou duas horas tudo se torna bem natural. Aliado a isso, voc\u00ea pode manipular os objetos do cen\u00e1rio usando o mouse e os bot\u00f5es de movimento, arrastando, levantando, girando, etc. Usando isso para resolver quebra-cabe\u00e7as, prender inimigos dentro de salas, ou qualquer outra utilidade que voc\u00ea achar pra eles.\n\nO segundo modo \u00e9 o de combate, na qual o eixo do seu personagem passa a ser controlado pelo seu mouse e os bot\u00f5es de movimento agora fazem o boneco orbitar o ponto em que o mouse est\u00e1 apontado. Junto a essa mudan\u00e7a completa na movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, voc\u00ea precisa ativamente influenciar a forma como seu personagem ataca, j\u00e1 que de novo, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 anima\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e9-setadas. Se o seu mouse faz um arco ap\u00f3s dar o input de ataque, o bra\u00e7o do personagem vai seguir esse arco. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil de explicar tanto quanto \u00e9 dif\u00edcil de apreender ele. Recomendo entrar no modo arena pra obter pr\u00e1tica.\n\nN\u00e3o bastasse essa estranheza em forma de modos de controle, o jogo n\u00e3o possui tutoriais in-game. Ele tem um manual que explica coisas b\u00e1sicas e o menu de controles que diz o que cada bot\u00e3o faz. Mas tirando isso, o jogador que se vire.\n\nE \u00e9 essa filosofia de o jogador que se vire que guia toda a sua aventura. Quer saber pra qual dire\u00e7\u00e3o voc\u00ea est\u00e1 indo? Tem uma bussola em alguma saleta perdida. Quer um mapa pra se localizar? Ache. Achou ele? \u00d3timo! Agora apreende a ler mapas porque n\u00e3o tem qualquer indicador de onde voc\u00ea est\u00e1 nele. O jogo todo \u00e9 assim, ele vai te colocar nesse mundo e dizer com um sorriso na cara: \"Te vira. E a prop\u00f3sito, n\u00e3o morre n\u00e3o porque voc\u00ea vai perder todo o seu progresso.\"\n\nN\u00e3o seria justo fazer um review desse jogo sem ressaltar algumas coisas: 1) Esse jogo est\u00e1 em Acesso Antecipado. H\u00e1 bugs, o sistema de habilidades e Taumaturgias (as magias desse jogo) est\u00e1 incompleto, nem todos os mapas est\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis, falta uma gama consider\u00e1vel de conte\u00fado a ser implementada e certas coisas precisam ser melhoradas; 2) Exanima n\u00e3o um jogo por si s\u00f3. Pelas minhas pesquisas, ele \u00e9 uma pseudo Tech Demo da engine propriet\u00e1ria que a Bare Mettle est\u00e1 desenvolvendo. Originalmente essa engine seria aplicada num outro t\u00edtulo chamado Sui Generis, que ainda est\u00e1 para sair, tendo sido prometido a mais de 10 anos e que incluir\u00e1 todos os sistemas presentes em Exanima; 3) Esse jogo est\u00e1 em desenvolvimento a mais de 10 anos. Isso indica tanto que os devs querem entregar um bom produto final quanto que os updates n\u00e3o s\u00e3o regulares. H\u00e1 muito conte\u00fado? Sim, mas n\u00e3o espere atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es mensais ou algo assim.\n\nNo fim, eu recomendo esse jogo. Definitivamente as 2 horas que a Steam te da pra testar um jogo antes de pedir reembolso n\u00e3o s\u00e3o suficientes pra entender bem os sistemas dele. Mas esse jogo, por algum milagre custa menos de 30 reais no momento desse review. Num mundo onde as vers\u00f5es ultimates de jogos AAA chegam a custar absurdos 600 reais (olhando pra voc\u00ea dona Ubisoft), um jogo com tanto conte\u00fado e por um pre\u00e7o t\u00e3o acess\u00edvel \u00e9 um grande respiro.
