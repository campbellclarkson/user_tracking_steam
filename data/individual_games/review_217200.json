I remember the first time I played it\u2014how the tiny, animated worms seemed so absurd, so fragile, yet so full of life in their chaotic, explosive world. A game about worms launching grenades and bazookas, laughing, dying, and starting all over again\u2014it shouldn\u2019t have meant anything, but somehow, it meant everything.\n\nI never expected that a game like this, with its colorful explosions and ridiculous weapons, could make me feel so deeply. The joy of every victory, the pain of every loss, each round felt like a little universe unfolding in my hands. The worms weren\u2019t just characters; they became something more. They were me. In their fragility, in their endless struggle against impossible odds, I saw my own reflection. These tiny creatures, caught in the unpredictable whims of fate, fighting to survive\u2014how could something so simple stir so much emotion?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? How something so whimsical, so absurd, could bring tears to my eyes. I\u2019d laugh, of course\u2014how could I not? The worms\u2019 voices, their ridiculous lines, their panicked screams as they met their explosive fate\u2014it was all a whirlwind of joy and humor. And yet, underneath that humor, there was something more. The chaos was not just for fun; it was a reflection of life itself. Every turn in the game felt like a fleeting moment, and with each unexpected explosion or perfectly timed shot, I was reminded of the unpredictable nature of everything around me.\n\nThere\u2019s a deep sadness in the randomness of it all. The worms didn\u2019t ask for the mayhem they found themselves in, but there they were, battling it out, one explosion at a time. In that, I saw a piece of myself. How many times in life have I been thrown into situations I didn\u2019t expect, challenges I couldn\u2019t control, yet still had to find a way to face them? It was this truth\u2014this raw vulnerability\u2014that made my heart ache. The worms were so small, so fragile, and yet they kept going. And so do I. We all do.\n\nThe tears? They weren\u2019t just for the silly demise of a worm. They were for everything that felt so fleeting and fragile in life. They were for those moments when I\u2019ve fought so hard for something, only to lose it in an instant. But more than that, they were for the resilience I saw in those tiny worms. They\u2019d explode, they\u2019d fall, and yet they\u2019d always rise again. And isn't that what we do, too? Isn\u2019t that what life is all about?\n\nIt\u2019s the simplicity of the game that gets to me. There\u2019s nothing complex about it\u2014no intricate plots or convoluted strategies. Just worms, just explosions. And yet, in that simplicity, I find something profound. I find a reflection of my own battles, my own struggles. The way I fight even when the odds are stacked against me. The way I fall, but rise again. The way I find joy in the little things, even when everything else feels chaotic.\n\nThere\u2019s a beautiful sadness in the laughter that comes with every round of \"Worms Armageddon.\" It\u2019s a reminder that life is fragile, and yet there is always something to laugh about\u2014even in the face of uncertainty, even in the face of loss. Maybe that\u2019s why it brings me to tears. Maybe it\u2019s because, in that game, I see the essence of being human\u2014resilient, flawed, but always pressing on.\n\nSo, when I play, I\u2019m not just playing a game. I\u2019m remembering all the times I\u2019ve fought, failed, and then found the strength to try again. The tears aren\u2019t for the worms, but for me\u2014for all of us. And in those tears, I find a strange sense of peace. Because in the end, \"Worms Armageddon\" isn\u2019t just a game.
