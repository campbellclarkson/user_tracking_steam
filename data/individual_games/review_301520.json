I have potentially thousands of hours on the standalone launcher but only a few matches on steam. I have not touched the game since 2019, and even that was a few matches to see how it was doing with some friends. Before that my last match was probably in 2016. I wouldn't recommend playing, especially now that it's going to shut down within a week, but I'm giving it a thumbs up for the great memories.\n\nThis game was one of the best. For a F2P game it was a genuinely amazing free experience back in 2014 and 15. It had fantastic combat, in-depth construction mechanics, and a decent progression system. The maps were interesting and reasonably varied, and each new one felt like it fit perfectly. Freejam had a solid game and a great community to build on. \n\nBut for some reason they just couldn't keep it going. Constant questionable updates started. There were some great updates, like the new gamemode and its respawning system. Some nice new weapons. But there was so much bad with the tiny bit of good. Map changes that removed defining features like the trench on that one map. Removing alignment rectifiers instead of buffing them and making them free. Changing spotting. Autoheal in the team deathmatch mode. Respawning in the team deathmatch mode. Removing tiers. Messing with the physics and balance changes to movement like nerfing tracks climbing or spider leg's weight. Removing the pilots seat. Changing objectives to simple cap circles. \n\nAnd the big one, loot boxes and the changes they brought to progression and currencies.\n\nIt seemed no player feedback was ever taken into account. Instead, all we got was trend chasing. And the game suffered. We suffered. As someone involved in the community, it hurt. As is typical, people left, making the game a worse experience and causing more people to leave.\n\nIt's a shame it had to end this way, but we told them it would if they didn't change course.

starting with my 3rd game, ALL my opponents had tier 5 weapons, I only have one tier 4 weapon unlocked, and I could have had more but I also need other parts, so I am forced to fight against enemies who are always stronger than me\n2: balancing again. the thing that spawns an unpenetrable, massive shield that still allows the team of whoever placed it to fire through it is SO OP, you have no idea, and it also lasts forever\n3: controls. this game is only ever playable if you build helicopters, the controls for land builds are abysmal, the toggle that allows you to switch from mouse steering to NORMAL keyboard steering that should be THE DEFAULT is hidden so well, it took me 5 hours of playing to find it, and even then it is all pointless, as keyboard controls are HORRID. all wheels and tank traks feel like there is 0 friction, you will spin out and fly, oversteere and so on from even lightly tapping your keyboard, serioyusly, steering a 50 ton tank feels like I am trying to deal with a wheightless cardboard driftcar, it is simply non-viable to use ground based builds (maybe legs are fine, IDK, I didn't try mechs yet) so the only option is to make a helicopter and suffer from having to balance weight with armor with firepower.\n4: weight. weight is just a number in this game, having 1000 tons or 10 tons, it doesn't matter, a tank will fly on the speed of 500+ KM/H anyway, seriously, make tanks feel like they do in WOT and cars more like in, well, ANY GAME WITH CARS, I mean, it can be GTA5, it can be trackmania, any NFS game, hell, even crossout, IDC anymore, just make cars and tanks not suck so bad.\n5: the \"Factory\". factory is the marketplace if this game where you can download desighns of other people, yet what ends up happening is that I see the same one annoying build in every battle, on both sides, with like 80% of builds being taken from the factory rather than hand made, which ruins the whole idea of this game, I know that some meta build with T5 guns is better than my T3/T4 build that I made out of my head, it just removes any competition and leaves me grinding tech points till I can just copy the same build everyone else uses.\n6: \"CPU\". the game has an insanely stupid mechanic of you being able to upgrade slots in your garage to fit bigger builds, but matchmaking does not care. my 1300 CPU helicopter with T3/T4 guns on my bronze 3/4 rating account will be sent to fight against 2000 (max possible) CPU meta builds with T5 guns and people who drive those builds will have some purple rank. so, how the hell am I supposed to win anything?\n7: cheaters. there is technique in many games like this one, it's called \"glitch welding\" it is the technique of using pistons to glitch parts into each-other, that can make many builds in this game smaller than they should be, or allow to enclose parts in armor in way that are normaly not possible, yet there is not even one sign of the developers trying to fix this. other ways of cheating include: instant fireing of weapons, infinite energy, perfect accuracy and if you want to see more, just serach for cheats for this game, there are grate plenty for this game is probably the easiest online PVP game to exploit ever.\n8: tryhards * cheaters * absence of ballance. imagine loading into battle on a 80 000KG heavy tank with all of the hull made of heavy blocks only to be obliderated within 3 seconds (I counted), that is this game, utterly unplayable when half of the player base are just fat incels who abuse this game because they get the kicks from not allowing
