Area-of-effect circles obscuring the ground so you can't see if there's a hole is a real pain (that could be remedied by making the circles \"drop off\" when there's an edge). The camera behavior in general is often frustrating (being shot by something that you can't see *even if both players are on that edge of the screen* because the camera just doesn't want to look over there in that particular area is a recurring annoyance).\r\n\r\nBut so many things done right make this still such a strong winner that now it's hard to find a new game to play.

The way life sometimes hands you these perfectly flawed gems that you can't help but love, like that weird uncle who tells inappropriate jokes at Christmas but makes the best pudding you've ever tasted. That's Nine Parchments for you.\n\nLet me tell you a story. Last week, I'm sitting there with my kid, right, playing this gorgeously crafted magical romp that looks like Disney had a baby with a fireworks factory. We're bouncing spells off each other like we're in some demented wizard circus, and half the time I'm accidentally freezing her character solid while she's gleefully electrocuting mine. It's absolute chaos, and we're loving every second of it.\n\nBut here's the thing - it's like that time I bought a fancy coffee machine. Looks brilliant, makes a decent cuppa, but it's got so many buttons and settings that you end up just pressing the same three over and over because who's got time to experiment when you just want your morning fix? That's what happens with the spells in this game. Sure, there's loads of them, but you'll find your favorites and stick to them like a pensioner to their favorite chair at the pub.\n\nPlaying solo? That's about as fun as going to a party where you don't know anyone and the host has disappeared. The game will batter you about like a ping pong ball in a tornado until you either give up or get lucky. But bring a friend along, and suddenly it's like adding vodka to a boring party - everything gets more entertaining, even if someone occasionally gets hurt.\n\nThe level design is gorgeous but linear as a Roman road. Imagine walking through an art gallery where someone's installed guide rails - you can see all these lovely bits off to the sides, but you're basically being shoved forward like a shopping trolley with a dodgy wheel. And don't get me started on the camera in co-op mode. It's like trying to take a group selfie where someone always ends up getting their head cut off, except here they actually die after 5 seconds off-screen.\n\nLook, if this game were a person, it'd be that friend who's absolutely brilliant at karaoke but only knows three songs. You'll have a blast every time you hang out, but you'll wish they'd learn some new material. The bosses are like those bouncers who look tough but are actually teddy bears - it's the regular punters you need to watch out for.\n\nBut you know what? Despite all its quirks - or maybe because of them - Nine Parchments is like that local pub that's rough around the edges but serves a proper pint. It's not perfect, but when you're there with good company, you wouldn't want to be anywhere else.\n\nNine Parchments is like a wizard's apprentice: Full of potential, occasionally sets things on fire, but charming enough to get away with it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1735298488, "timestamp_updated": 1735298488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576868832111358643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183837940": {"recommendationid": "183837940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203705893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1735532976}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game on sale and it's been a blast.
