Not only did the movement system pave the way for games like Call of Duty and Titan Fall it also features one of the best character creators in a shooter. There are a ton of options for your character both on the Resistance and Security Factions, all of which are locked behind xp which can be gathered both offline and online (if you can find an active server that is.) a feature which now a days is usually locked behind a greedy paywall. The shooting although not as good as a modern shooter, is decent enough to provide some crazy memorable moments. The class system though simplistic gives everyone a chance to feel like they're contributing to the fight, even if they're not playing the main objective. I honestly think Brink never got the day in the sun that it really deserved. My only wish is that the AI was a little less brain dead. Over all Brink even with all its flaws is a solid 8/10 experience and I highly recommend anyone who is looking for some time to kill or even just enjoys FPS games give this one a look. It doesn't deserve and has never deserved the hate that a bunch of people seem to throw its way.\n\nFOR THE ARK!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1736870865, "timestamp_updated": 1736870938, "voted_up":
