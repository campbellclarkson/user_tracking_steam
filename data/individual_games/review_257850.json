Why, explain, instead of having a short cut statement.\n\n\"Game feels unsatisfying and a hassle\" Never played a game without it holding your hand before?\n\nAll these \"reviews\"are just your opinions, and are not constructive, or have in depth explanation, your influencing people who are curious about this game, with your short and dry opinions more then crustructive facts.\n\nFor me this game is visually amazing, the pixel art is gorgeous, the music is amazing, the story isnt laid out for you, its to be pieced together as you play, the combat is difficult if your not ready for it.\n\nIf you play expecting to just push through the game your gotta have a bad time, there are secrets everywhere which have upgrade materials for your abilities, health kits to find so you can stay alive, there is a place to practice your swordsmanship,its the same place you buy your new abilities, and they give short tutorials to make fights easier and give more to your arsenal.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is kinda bleak, with some rays of hope in it, the world your in is not in a good spot, you see innocents die to cruel tyrants, but at least you get a chance to take those down, the only safe haven has a low population, but the people there are hopeful.\n\nIf your unsure about this game, get it on a sale, get a feel of it and how it works, and plays, give it a fair go, there is tons to find, to explore, heaps of secrets, and if you dont like it and your playtime is below 2hrs, give it a refund, dont let these people with their half assed reviews influence your decision.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game really draws you in,", "timestamp_created": 1737332713, "timestamp_updated": 1737332813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

With secrets abound and a tightly crafted world to explore, you're getting your money's worth. But you'll walk away wanting more, only to realize this is wholly unique in its approach.

"review": "Oh man, I had put off playing this game for years despite it being part of my Steam library for a long time.  I expected to like the opening act and get frustrated by difficulty or strange choices by the designers.  I was ready for disappointment, but it never came.  Instead, I think Hyper Light Drifter may be the best recent game, that is meant to resemble a classic game, that I have ever played.  Of course there's the art-style, but this game is drawing from so many classics with its almost complete absence of dialog and subtle story telling as well as that feeling of almost being completely unsure of where it is you are supposed to go and do.  Then there's the difficulty and the very Zelda-like system of upgrades and power-ups.  It attempts what so many other games have but really gets it right.\n\nMost of the gameplay is top down (ish) with the player hacking, slashing, shooting, and dashing their way across various well-worn video game settings - ice, dessert, swamp, and mountain.  Of course, you collect the equivalent of gems that unlock your path toward a final confrontation, and there are many non-essential secrets and hidden collectibles to find for the eager explorer.  Some light Metroidvania elements also come into play as you'll backtrack a bit once you collect enough doodahs to open those previously inaccessible areas.\n\nSimply put - I loved it.  I wanted my sessions to last longer, and I couldn't wait to jump back in.  It is one of those that I (already) wish I could play again for the first time without knowing anything.

Tendremos un arsenal de armas distintas, mejoras, habilidades y un movimiento din\u00e1mico a base de dashes.\n\nEl juego se divide por zonas y su historia esta mas mostrada que contada. No hay escritos, no hay palabras, aunque hay unos objetivos opcionales en idioma propio del juego que nos ayudaran a entender que ocurri\u00f3 en los lugares que visitamos.\n\nHablando de los lugares.

You'll have an arsenal of different weapons, upgrades, abilities, and dynamic movement based on dashes.\n\nThe game is divided into zones, and its story is more shown than told. There are no written texts or words, although there are optional objectives in the game\u2019s own language that help us understand what happened in the places we visit.\n\nSpeaking of the locations: the atmosphere is fantastic. Vibrant colors, entirely distinct and recognizable zones that are seamlessly integrated with one another. The music also complements the experience. While it may not pump you full of adrenaline, the soundtrack does allow you to immerse yourself more deeply in the game's rhythm.\n\nThere\u2019s no traditional narrative, but the world will tell you everything you want to know as you explore. It\u2019s a game that invites exploration, so if you prefer linear or heavily narrative-driven games, this might not be for you.\n\nHowever, if you want a game filled with secrets, gameplay at your own pace, a modest challenge, a story shrouded in mystery, and a world to explore and dive into\u2014this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1736281617, "timestamp_updated": 1736281647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185045516": {"recommendationid": "185045516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044123602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 675, "last_played": 1686114485}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so-so, get if you like dashy-slashies.\n\nGameplay is pretty good.\n\nStory draws you in with a \"show, don't tell\" approach but kind of peters out without a super interesting resolution or lore explanation.

It's good enough that I can't imagine many people disliking it unless it's really not in their preferred genre's at all. Not perfect, in my opinion, but the very few things that niggled at me were far outweighed by the things that I really liked. \n\nStand out elements for me were the graphic design and atmosphere. I won't pretend I fully understand what was going on in the story, which is entirely told through visual elements, but I really felt \"in\" this alien, oppressive and seemingly quite broken and sad world. Sound design was also really nice, further drawing me in. It is worth noting the one time I played with headphones on it felt like it was blowing my ear drums out as soon as there was a cut scene (there aren't many but I happened to hit one in that session) as the volume sliders seem to not apply to them. But all in all this is a captivating experience.\n\nGameplay was mostly good, occasional frustrations and there were a couple of elements I never really mastered like the dash attacks, but for the most part it feels responsive enough and also open enough to approach in different ways that I found it quite satisfying. Boss fights were good, I only beat one on my first try and most took me a dozen or so attempts to get through, with a couple being roughly double that. Outside of bosses, enemies all demand slightly different approaches, which is cool. They aren't hard individually once you learn what they do, but when mixed and matched it created some challenging scenarios. It's worth noting this game employs check points which can feel quite harsh at times, although in the end I enjoyed it because it forced me to \"get good\"... or at least less bad, to get through a few of the more tricky sections.\n\nThe exploration and secret elements were cool, and players who relish really digging into a game and trying to unlock and see everything may well find this game really scratches that hard to 100% itch. Felt a lot like a metroidvania in that respect. For me I enjoyed trying to find hidden paths and areas as I was going through each level (the game is essentially split into four big levels, with a hub world in between) but found it hard to remember where I had been and hadn't been fairly quickly with-in each of those four sections. I also didn't find the map fairly intuitive to use, and after a couple of hours of backtracking areas trying to find... well... everything, I started to find that quite frustrating and gave up on it, just progressing to the end of the game instead.", "timestamp_created": 1736109688, "timestamp_updated": 1736144302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184789911": {"recommendationid": "184789911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271384945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1429, "last_played": 1736037071}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1736037143, "timestamp_updated": 1736037143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184769538": {"recommendationid": "184769538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093221196", "num_games_owned": 1793, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 439, "deck_playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1736443372}, "language": "english", "review": "Visually breathtaking, mechanically unrefined.

Fighting groups of enemies is challenging and requires use of all combat tools.\n\nNegatives:\n- Just focusing on the gameplay and combat mechanics, the game is incredibly clunky and frustrating for no reason. There are absurd challenges like doing 800 dashes in a row.
