But instead of reading and typing words, you're reading dish orders and inputting corresponding hotkeys at blistering pace. And yes, you can customize hotkeys for all the dishes, which is pretty sweet. However, there are some notable limitations: the key to serve a dish has to be Enter, and you can only use letters, so [];',. etc. aren't allowed.\n\nEvery day that you do well, you get \"buzz\", i.e. the game speeds up. There's no significant bonus related to this other than that you get more customers and earn more money. Most importantly, it makes the game speed fit your skill level. So this is just good game design.\n\nThe game also has great humor. If you stay a bit in the intro, you get people saying Cook, Serve, Delicious in every way possible. The e-mails you receive every day are full of character and humor as well.\n\nAll that is to say, these developers really know what they're doing, and I look forward to getting 100% for this game!", "timestamp_created": 1737335702, "timestamp_updated": 1737335731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185952297": {"recommendationid": "185952297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143155690", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 601, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1737313111}, "language": "english", "review": "delicious", "timestamp_created": 1737303769, "timestamp_updated": 1737303769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185887371": {"recommendationid": "185887371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965071358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1737231373}, "language": "english", "review": "The first Cook, Serve, Delicious is a good starting point to the franchise.
