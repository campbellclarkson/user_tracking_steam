Here\u2019s my detailed review:\n\nPositive Aspects:\nDark Humor: The game is brimming with dark humor. From the sarcastic comments of the characters to the exaggerated situations you find yourself in \u2013 there\u2019s never a dull moment. Who knew being evil could be so funny?\n\nMinion Mayhem: The small but extremely chaotic minions are the highlight of the game. These little devils turn the battlefield into a mess and create unpredictable and often hilarious moments. It's almost like commanding a horde of hyperactive squirrels.\n\nMoral Flexibility: You have the choice to be a little nice (at least on the surface) or completely evil. Both paths are incredibly entertaining. After all, who doesn\u2019t want to know what it\u2019s like to be the ultimate villain?\n\nHarem Dreams: Yes, in Overlord 2 you can actually have multiple women \u2013 a dream come true for some, right? Of course, only in the game context. \ud83d\ude09\n\nInteresting Story: The storyline is captivating and provides enough material to keep you interested until the end. It\u2019s fun to battle through the various chapters and become increasingly powerful.\n\nRevisiting Areas: It\u2019s fun to revisit areas to collect everything and truly leave no stone unturned. There's always something new to discover or destroy.\n\nNegative Aspects:\nControls: The controls could be better and sometimes feel a bit clunky. It\u2019s a challenge to maneuver the camera to keep everything in view.\n\nMinion AI: The AI of the minions is sometimes really questionable. Occasionally, they simply don\u2019t do what they\u2019re supposed to, which can be frustrating. But maybe they\u2019re just cleverly disguised?\n\nBuggy Minions: Occasionally, you encounter bugs affecting the minions. This can disrupt the flow of the game when your little helpers suddenly start acting up. But hey, who needs perfect minions?\n\nRepetitive Tasks: Some missions and tasks repeat and can become monotonous over time. A bit more variety would be welcome.\n\nFlorian the Elf: This elfin slacker causes more chaos than your minions! Instead of being useful, Florian just runs around spouting poetic nonsense while you do the real work. Sometimes you wonder if he wouldn\u2019t be better off in a Shakespeare play.\n\nConclusion:\nOverlord 2 is a devilishly good adventure that will delight both fans of the first game and newcomers alike. The mix of dark humor, minion mayhem, and moral flexibility makes it an unforgettable experience. Despite minor flaws like the controls and AI, it\u2019s an experience you won\u2019t soon forget. And if Florian the Elf gets on your nerves again, rest assured your minions are there to bring the battlefield back to order.\n\nRating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1736779300, "timestamp_updated": 1736780054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185473635": {"recommendationid": "185473635", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999102269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1736720333}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like a walking simulator.

Sadly, it still lacks in many ways and I do not recommend it. In my opinion it is a fundamental problem that stems from the game it wants to be, a humoristic Pikmin-like game in third person with a little more focus on action. The first game showed that this mixture of ideas was suboptimal in execution, and even though this game improves a lot upon the flaws of the first game it still does not reach a satisfying level.\r\n\r\nIn Overlord 2 you play as a new master of minions, small goblin-like creatures, tasked with taking over the lands from the hands of the corrupt empire. Again, the game asks the question: \"You are an evil overlord, but are you more evil than the enemies you are trying to defeat?\", which is a good hook plot-wise. Compared to the first game, this game has better level-design, slightly better AI for the minions, a map (which is a godsend) and a few tweaks here and there in order to improve things all around.\r\n\r\nThat is where the good ends, as the rest is still a slow slog through an awfully written game with terrible dialogue, a camera-perspeictve that just does not work with the whole \"commanding not-pikmin to defeat enemies and solve puzzles\"-thing. Well, it sort of works, this time around, but it still feels so lackluster. The pacing is very weird and every encounter either feels way too easy or like complete BS. Nothing is ever fun or satisfying, at best the game feels okay. The concept just does not land for me and I keep thinking about how much I love Pikmin and how much this game would have been so much better if it was just... more like Pikmin. However, that is probably protected by Nintendo very agressively, so that is a no-go.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this game is not terrible but I just cannot recommend it. It does not serve a purpose or fill a void that another game does not fill better. It feels lacking and I had a bad time with it. Go play Pikmin instead and save yourself the money and the time it takes to get through this slow slog.", "timestamp_created": 1735646065, "timestamp_updated": 1735646065, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183964143": {"recommendationid": "183964143", "author": {"steamid": "76561199642932868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1735875328}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no me deja abrir este juego, no se que onda, capaz es un problema de sistema mio pero no se, mal ahi, yo queria jugarlo.\n", "timestamp_created": 1735373827, "timestamp_updated": 1735373827, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491103202104568481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183904239": {"recommendationid": "183904239", "author": {"steamid": "76561199558834917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1735379835}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041d\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0430, \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043c\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u044d\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c. \u0417\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1735325185, "timestamp_updated": 1735372686, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499445050954818726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183878608": {"recommendationid": "183878608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020635428", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 819, "last_played": 1735402031}, "language": "french", "review": "+1", "timestamp_created": 1735308156, "timestamp_updated": 1735308156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183870281": {"recommendationid": "183870281", "author": {"steamid": "76561199624879282", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1735386063}, "language": "english", "review": "it says it does not support controllers but it does you just have to go into the settings and change your input to gamepad. also a wonderful game!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1735301125, "timestamp_updated": 1735301125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606907129287719727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183856632": {"recommendationid": "183856632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118242616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 409, "playtime_at_review": 16943, "last_played": 1736902824}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play this as a kid and its just as good then as it is now.", "timestamp_created": 1735287746, "timestamp_updated": 1735287746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183822736": {"recommendationid": "183822736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162570316", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4258, "last_played": 1619045387}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately, I believe this will be the pinnacle of the Overlord series.
