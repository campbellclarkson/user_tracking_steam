This online multiplayer game, developed by BlankMediaGames, is a treasure trove of strategy, bluffing, and pure fun. Since its release in 2014, it has drawn in players from all over the world, including me\u2014and let me tell you, it\u2019s been an absolute blast.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Town of Salem so addictive is the sheer variety it offers. At the start of each match, you\u2019re assigned a random role, and the anticipation is half the fun. Will you be the brave Sheriff hunting down the Mafia, the cunning Godfather orchestrating murders, or maybe the wild-card Jester, whose goal is simply to get lynched? With over 30 unique roles, every game feels fresh and exciting.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is split into Day and Night phases, and this is where the magic happens. By day, you\u2019ll argue, accuse, and defend yourself in a whirlwind of chaotic chat messages. By night, you\u2019ll quietly execute your role\u2019s abilities\u2014investigating, protecting, or even eliminating others. The balance between strategy and social interaction is perfect, and the unpredictability of human players keeps you on your toes.\r\n\r\nWhat I love most about Town of Salem is how it brings out everyone's personality. I\u2019ve had moments of triumph where I outwitted an entire lobby as a sneaky Serial Killer, and I\u2019ve laughed out loud at the absurdity of being lynched as a Doctor just because I \u201clooked suspicious.\u201d Even when I lose, the journey is so entertaining that it hardly matters.\r\n\r\nThe community is a big part of the experience. Sure, you\u2019ll encounter some intense players, but most are just there for a good time, and the camaraderie (or friendly betrayal) adds so much to the game.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned strategist or just looking for some lighthearted chaos, Town of Salem is a game that will leave you grinning, plotting, and hitting \u201cPlay Again\u201d far too many times.

Who will they ban though? They will ban long term players you've played for years for the most trivial reasons.

I appealed this strike and the power tripping useless mod tried to tell me that being afk was as good as leaving the game.

Though I have my issues with it, it's a fun take on the social deduction genre, where there are a myriad of interesting roles to be and no one is just a boring \"villager\" with nothing to do (aside from maybe Survivors). I wish it had a larger playerbase, but most everyone's migrated to TOS2. Coven expansion is definitely worth it.
