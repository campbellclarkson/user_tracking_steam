8.5/10\r\n\r\nHow does a 20-year-old game like Star Wars: Republic Commando hold up in 2025? To my amazement, it plays pretty well! First off, the music - just phenomenal. With access to virtually any Star Wars song, they've crafted an auditory experience that perfectly complements the militaristic vibe of the game. The opening sequence? Absolutely perfect, setting the tone for what's to come.\r\n\r\nFor 2005, it's surprisingly reminiscent of what Half-Life did for the genre, you actually feel like you're part of the war-torn galaxy of the Clone Wars.\r\n\r\nHowever, gameplay does have its caveats. After a while, it can feel a bit monotonous. The missions start to blend together, and the squad commands, while innovative for the time, can feel clunky by today's standards. But, if you're a Star Wars fan, these are minor gripes. The game truly captures the essence of the clone troopers' life, making you feel like part of the squad. The graphics, while dated, have a charm to them. They don't detract from the experience but rather add to the nostalgia for these older type of games.\r\n\r\nIf you love Star Wars, you'll find plenty to enjoy here. It throws you back into the world of the prequels from a unique and cool angle; and it really shows how well some games age.

(It's pretty cheap as well!) https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3173072602\nMy favourite thing is the soundtrack: many tracks are directly from the movies. The insane part is that this games' original music can EASILY compete with one of the best movie scores ever made. During the game you visit 3 locations, which are visually distinct and have interesting, short stories around them. There are also partially different enemies and weapons per level. The characters are great and your squadmates have a lot of character, the ensuing banter between them is entertaining as well. Managing your squad and focusing enemies is pretty fun.\n\nUnfortunately that does not apply to the combat: Firstly, enemies are very spongey, so you need to focus them down. Shooting a super battle droid on full-auto for 20 seconds still feels too much. In later levels the game SPAMS those enemies, too. Secondly, the melee has no range at all, I had to almost stand inside the enemies to even hit them. Hilariously the mini-knife is the strongest weapon in the game and does insane damage... Thirdly, the pace is pretty slow in general. It's supposed to be a more tactical game, I get it. But invisible walls everywhere, which don't allow me to jump over the SMALLEST of covers is pretty annoying. Lastly, the permanently respawning enemies are a gigantic pain in the ass, and I am not talking about the droid dispensers. Getting swarmed on Geonosis by spongey, infinitely respawning enemies was an awful affair!", "timestamp_created": 1735748386, "timestamp_updated": 1735750442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184370936": {"recommendationid": "184370936", "author": {"steamid": "76561199587891925", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1735896472}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr mich einer der besten wenn nicht sogar das beste Star Wars Spiel", "timestamp_created": 1735682709, "timestamp_updated": 1735682709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184354947": {"recommendationid": "184354947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115894842", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1735839177}, "language": "english", "review": "I like!
