Maybe these issues are exclusive to online play and the local co-op play is fine, but I can't comment on that.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I had with the game is in regard of balancing. We felt that the last couple of levels had an atrocious platforming that can be beaten with regular abilities, but are designed to be tackled using double jump or mid air dash, which are not a guaranteed drop per run. This is issue is killing my interest in playing this game further, since without the aforementioned abilities; the platforming required for these levels is not what I consider enjoyable at all!\r\nI hope that this is something that was rectified the sequel 30XX.", "timestamp_created": 1737121981, "timestamp_updated": 1737121981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185734069": {"recommendationid": "185734069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829826151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1607454850}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Basicamente Megaman Souls-like, divertidinho mas n\u00e3o me prendeu, mas imagino que para quem gosta de jogos no estilo souls-like e curte Megaman esse pode ser uma escolha boa.", "timestamp_created": 1737057536, "timestamp_updated": 1737057536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185671258": {"recommendationid": "185671258", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027995844", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1639, "playtime_at_review": 1964, "last_played": 1737400058}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love platformers, and you love rougelikes, this is the game for you.
