Easily gobbled up by the modern smooth brained consumer. The very essence of what made Total War games great is gone now, replaced with; flashy animations, DLC that itches that scratch of the modern ADHD riddled audience and gameplay that consists of going woah as you watch a mammoth fight a medieval knight.\n\nThe limitations of history are what made it great. Artistic freedom has its merits, but if you give a giraffe a short neck, well it's no longer a giraffe. The beauty was in the real history, someone's dreams will never be more glorious or interesting than that. The strategy that came from the slight differences in the culture of the units and the play style of real historical warfare techniques. Battles that consisted of hammer and anvil strikes, kiting, pincer movements and using routing to drive your enemy off the battle field. The games were difficult in their own way, organically, especially to the average player.\n\nNow these fantasy games are just about consuming. Appeasing the modern audience member, someone that collects figurines and claps at the end of superhero movies. They are just flashy trash. Magic cool downs, single entity units, blobs of units, essentially no routing (apart from dumb faction specific mechanics), I could go on.\n\nOn top of all that, what substance does the game actually have? no naval battles, the sieges are awful and the battles last 5 minutes. The games have went backwards mechanically and became dumber.

one campaign, normal difficulty.  I won.  Apparently that took 46 hours of my life, for 160 turns.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly I did leave the computer running while I attended to things like 'having a life', but a lot of the play time was just watching the computer animate the turns of all of its sock-puppets.  Could the devs not default the computer-owned factions to 'fastest' animation?  It took me until turn 148 to work out that I could speed this turgid nonsense up.\r\n\r\nIf you've played Total War before, this game doesn't offer a lot of new challenges.  The battles are fundamentally different due to all the new mechanics (flying, magic, heroes) but most single-player Total War is won on the economy with only having to play battles where the auto button won't give a fair result (mostly defenses where you can obviously win but the auto is claiming you might lose).  Out of the maybe 20 hours of actual playtime it took me to win my first go (not all of the time watching the computer move pieces around), about 6 hours were defending the same defensive fortification against the same two computer opponents that were somehow able to keep generating full stacks of opponents that would apparently take the position easily if I just auto-ed it... so I had to keep playing that battle manually every time, winning comfortably, but it took about 15 minutes each time.\r\n\r\nSo yeah... I probably got to actually \"play\" the game for 14 hours, with the rest of the clock being taken up with repetitious animation and repetitious battles that are totally unnecessary, except for the AI being coded to tell you that your troops can't defend unless you babysit them.  The big set-piece \"Chaos Invasion\" thing was a let down - I'd built reasonable defenses after the first incursion showed up, so I proactively engaged with it and defeated it one turn without ever seeing any of the animation (targeted the boss dude with some resources, pressed auto, whole darn Chaos Invasion evaporated without me ever seeing a single sprite).\r\n\r\nThere were some nice elements - I played as \"the Empire\", and there's a plotline for you to follow (albeit it's a total railroad - either do the quests or don't, there aren't any choices involved).  But I enjoyed those set-piece battles.

The basic grand single player campaign is essentially the first game with DLC factions added. The story campaign is well done and worth a play as well. Since I tend to focus on the grand campaign, the sense that this is more of a DLC than new title is stronger. \r\nSome new mechanics breathe life into factions from the first game, for better or worse. While new factions get shiny new mechanics to work with, also for better or worse. For example the Dwarf Book of Grudges adds flavor to that faction, but can also feel like it has too much impact and limits your play style choices. As usual things like Auto-Resolve for battles is unbalanced at best. Now there is a preview of the outcome before choosing auto-resolve but even a battle the AI would hand you a decisive defeat are easily won by fighting the battle manually. \r\nThere seems to be more diplomacy options but the AI still creates huge confederacies while you struggle to get trade agreements with friendly factions. AI will still not accept vassalage or confederacy when their only other option is extinction. Long term allies are like needy ex-girlfriends that will randomly break up with you then a few turns later are burning up your phone to talk. \r\nOverall it does what Total War does best, combining a turn based over-world with real time tactical battles. It makes fairly good use of the source material. Zooming in on battles shows great detail, good sound, and quite a bit of dialog. Spells and monsters look fantastic, although it can be hard to take time to stop and smell the blood soaked roses in the heat  of battle. \r\nAs someone with a massive amount of time playing the first game, this one being more like a DLC bundle or remaster of the first is a net positive. Being that the TW series tend to be expensive and rarely on sale, the value for money is open to argument. Since it's so close to the first game, just play that until you can score this one on sale.
