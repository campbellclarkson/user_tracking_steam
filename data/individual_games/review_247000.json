Pay great attention to them. \nTo win the game you have to level up your stats and in order to do that you have to encounter items or enemies. In theory this is easy as you just have to roll a dice to move to another field where you encounter these needed items or enemies.\nTHE ONLY FUCKING PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY ROUNDS WHERE YOU JUST WASTE YOUR TIME AND DO LITERALLY NOTHING.\nYou can encounter enemies and draw the fight with them -> nothing happens in this round.\nYou can step on fields where your character cannot do anything, because your alignment is incorrect -> nothing happens in this round.\nYou can encounter useless NPCs and Followers -> nothing happens in this round.\nSo you are just sitting there, most of the time only waiting for your turn, because every fucking move takes ages. Then if it is finally your turn, you just make an useless move, and wait for ages again.\nFrom time to time, you die and respawn, starting from zero again, probably with the next useless character with even worse abilities.\nYes, even after playing for 4 hours, you can still die because you have bad luck 3 times. Just start from the beginning again :)\nEven when all players are playing together a game with five players takes at least 3 to 4 hours, with only one or two persons being able to win at all.\nSo in the end, this game is probably the most tilting game in the world, because you just get crazy after a while from all that waiting and useless turns.\nAnyways, I'm still a big NULLRUNDENENJOYER, because doing nothing usefull at all is the quintessence of live.\nThank you, 0/10 would only recommend if you like being sadistic.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736117721, "timestamp_updated": 1736117721, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458243399858474731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184879299": {"recommendationid": "184879299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198719843", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1328, "last_played": 1736118041}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game.
