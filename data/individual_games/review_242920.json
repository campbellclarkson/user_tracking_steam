Quarry's cannot be deleted and if you place one every single villager will have crippling depression and never repopulate.\r\n\r\n\u2022 There's such janky placement regarding mines.

I.e., you will need a Marketplace in the center of your town, but the starting buildings don't include or leave space for one.\n2) People can clear resources and even clear a space for a building but they can't actually build the building until a nearby stockpile is designated for them to move the cleared resources to the stockpile and back again to the building location. Why does it work this way? I have no idea, the tutorials made no mention.\n3) People get cold when they don't have housing to warm up, and them being cold prevents them from constructing the housing. So they freeze to death while the housing remains incomplete.\n4) Getting the people to actually do what you want them to do is a challenge. During the warmer months, you will designate for them to construct a boarding house so they have somewhere to warm up when the weather gets cold, but they wander off doing random things or idling for months until the weather turns cold and they die while the housing hardly made any progress.\n5) The people age rapidly so that their ages don't actually correspond with the in-game passage of time unless you download a mod that is literally called \"one year is one year.\" Yes, that's right, you literally have to download a mod in order for one year to equal one year.\n6) There is no \"Game Over\" screen. You WILL game over many times while trying to learn this game, but the game doesn't even have the common decency to tell you when literally all your people are dead. Instead, you have to know which option to display your population count in order to see that it's zero and that you should probably start over or find something else to do with your time.\n\nIf this was a decade ago, I could probably say this game has a lot of potential, and I REALLY like the premise. But this game feels like it was never actually completed and got all the kinks worked out.\n\nI hope other devs will see the overblown \"success\" of Banished and eventually give us something that is worth all the hype.", "timestamp_created": 1735190480, "timestamp_updated": 1735190763, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476922005414962769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183719995": {"recommendationid": "183719995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011501800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1049, "last_played": 1556510028}, "language": "english", "review": "It's boring.
