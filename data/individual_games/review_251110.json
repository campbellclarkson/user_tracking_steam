I think this is a quite clever setup for a mystery game, because a structural inspector is essentially a detective whose \"crime scenes\" are corroded rebar and exposed electrical wiring. The dilapidated places you explore gradually reveal evidence of a major conspiracy involving their owners, turning your photos of structural decay into genuine criminal evidence. It's like playing out an ATSB (or NTSB etc) incident report in real-time, it's awesome.\n\nThe puzzles can be quite hard, I have to set the game aside and come back to it the next day sometimes. I like that all of the environments (so far at least) have been directly connected to each other, so it really feels like an adventure. It's also amazingly long for what seems like a niche game, I've just hit act 2 after like... 18 hours on this save or something.\n\nIf you're the sort of person who occasionally spots an obscure maintenance access doorway from the train window and becomes intensely curious about what it's like in there, and where you might pop out if you went exploring, I recommend this game.

It's not that it isn't exciting. I die, and nearly die, constantly. I've bumbled Mark over unexploded ordinance, into electrified puddles, onto burning vents, and into flooded tunnels. It's not that the puzzles are too easy, in fact (much like real life), most puzzles have multiple solutions and none of them are strictly easy. It's not that the game isn't scary. In fact, I'd go as far as to call this the best liminal horror game. There is no monster that will jump out and scream at you, there is only a hobo trying hard to keep quiet so you don't call the cops. The groan and creak of pipes and concrete fight with the sounds of distant mumbles and coughs to make you wonder if you really are alone.\r\n\r\nThe game truly excels in two main areas: Exploration and Visuals. \r\nThe exploration is absolutely top notch, Valve should be jealous for how well these devs have made linear levels that have multiple paths through them. Heck, going back and replaying the game, I'm realizing how many puzzles I just platformed my way around solving, and I'm not even certain whether or not that's intentional design (apologies to any suddenly terrified devs, I will always break any linear progression, this is strictly a me problem) Searching for documents and damage to photograph, finding empty geocaches, and the coveted secrets.\r\nVisually the game is the best I have ever seen any Source engine game look. I can't tell you how much like a scandinavian city Stalburg looks like, but I can only assume it's as accurate to your major Scandinavian cities as the bridges are to bridges and the service tunnels are to service tunnels, that is to say: Very close to real, with just enough creative smudging to ease gameplay and exploration, and to cut off routes that you might otherwise wander down diagetically.  Only an actual honest-to-goodness civil engineer could tell the difference between some of these models and the real thing, and even then the models all include subtle details that throw off even an infrastructure enthusiast like myself. Unless you're an actual professional, this game is completely realistic.\r\n\r\nThe real star of the show, however, is the game's story.\r\nInfra has two stories. A twisting and complex narrative about how industrial competition and conspirasism inevitable leads to corruption, and \"Markku Siltanen has a very bad day\". You can keep your nose clean and ignore the papers and docs around (though this will make a lot of puzzles much harder), focusing on documenting infrastructure damage and repairing neglected equipment, or you can dig deep into the secrets behind the collapse of industry, the failure of infrastructure, and how a feud two insane businessmen lead to the neglected desolation of an entire city's infrastructure.", "timestamp_created": 1736882009, "timestamp_updated": 1736882009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608592331409454346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185556944": {"recommendationid": "185556944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214178372", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1613197223}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is basically an walking simulator and its boring.", "timestamp_created": 1736831665, "timestamp_updated": 1736831665, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.361164450645446777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185556571": {"recommendationid": "185556571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041846276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2335, "last_played": 1727211816}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a way of sticking with you.

There are variety of difficulty in puzzles from which some require heavy logical thinking while others are more finding stuff and using it. The bad 10% of puzzles requires extra detailed scavenging of every part of the map and/or backtracking. Overall the puzzles are the best part of this game.\r\n\r\nExploration is done for lore and to photograph \"corruption\", which are structural or other kind of issues one finds in world. Using the camera is basically the main point of the game, you are inspector after all. Only that there are so huge amount of these things to photograph that it gets very boring at some point. To add to that problem, there is nothing really in the game that says if you have done good or bad in your job. Maybe there is some different endings, but that does not make the task of doing the thing any more interesting. At very least your collegues or boss should acknowledge your good job, to show that somebody actually cares that you do your job. You can play the game as puzzle game without using the camera any more that you want, but its a shame that the main point is not developed any further from the initial idea.\r\n\r\nLore is... Well lets just say that there is lots of reading and if reading is not for you, whole game will feel very confusing. Some of the lore is confusing even when one reads everything. And some reading is required to advance in the game. One big problem is that you don't save any of the text anywhere. Meaning that you need to remember everything or keep your own notes to build any kind of bigger picture. I would also like the world to be explained little better; why for example our main character can't call his boss or police or other people for help. Instead he is stuck wandering endless tunnel network with real possibility of dying at many occasions.\r\n\r\nOverall, while there are some parts that feel grindy or boring especially at middle sections, the basic gameplay works just fine. Its interesting concept that for me raised the question how the concept gets used and developed through the game. It just didn't, which was bummer, and thats why in my opinion the game should have been few chapters shorter to feel more rewarding as whole experience.
