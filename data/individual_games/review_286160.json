(There even is a discord server for the game where you can get help on how to mod this game)\n\n- The Bad - \n\n1) All base game content is very limited and very generic . \n\n2) Most maps in the workshop are very low efford . \n\n3) Beyond just simulating some board games aka most of the time just move some card and or objects manually you can't do anything else (TBF its in the title) \n\n4) Scripting in general is very limited , even in the maps that bothered to script at all if you make a save and then reload it the scripts [b] instantly break [/b] . \n\n- the Ugly - \n\n1) Ui is very simplistic to the point that its bad but i do think there are people out there that would appreciate this . \n\n2) [b] EXTREMELY [/b] Group heavy . If you don't have a squad of at least 3 people or more then you won't be able to play like 90% of all the maps . \n\n3) Most maps (assuming that you have the amount of people it requires) generally have a whole bunch of pages with rules that at least one of you should memorize all of them . This isn't either good or bad .\n\n\n- Conclusion -\n\nConsidering all of the above i really can't bring myself to rate this any more than a 3/10 for the price . I would only recommend you to buy this game if you are in either of these situations . \n1) are a huge fan of tabletop games in general And also have a couple of buddies to play with \n\n2) If you are looking to make your own maps for the game . (this includes me)\nIf you aren't in any of the above scenarios then i would recommended to skip this game .", "timestamp_created": 1736982596, "timestamp_updated": 1737142574, "voted_up": false,

"language": "english", "review": "A very valuable resource to anyone into the Tabletop games format. The appeal boils down to the fact most of the content you consume in this game will be user generated, and has an open-backend with the ability to script/code features into the game, resulting in some truly impressive tables. Catan? Randomized maps. Monopoly? Pick 15 variations and enjoy. Pokemon fan? Check out Legend of Sinnoh (and use the QoL mods too with the Additive Load function!) or Let's Go Adventure; both hours long time sinks you and friends can enjoy.\r\n\r\nThere's only 3 downsides/negative things I can say about this game:\r\n1: It will EAT through storage since it saves assets to your documents folder. just go Documents -> My Games ->Tabletop Simulator ->Mods and delete the Images, Images Raw, Models, and Models Raw folders to clear them up (I just recovered 51.4GB doing this lol. Granted that includes a table over 150mb itself)\r\n2: The Scripting uses the Lua coding language; notoriously annoying to work with\r\n3: Your enjoyment on the game will correlate to if you have people to play it with unless you're REALLY into single player board games like the Slay the Spire board game. I recommend only investing in this game if you know you have 3+ people to play with. Check out some of the public lobbies too; there's Red Dragon Inn games and similar open to the public that might help you find some new friends!

No, that\u2019s not a typo\u2014530 hours. I\u2019ve spent more time with this game than some people spend at work (don\u2019t tell my boss). And you know what? I\u2019m still not tired of it.\n\nFirst things first: Tabletop Simulator is a digital miracle. I\u2019ve been able to play a variety of classics, from Monopoly (we don't talk about that one) to Settlers of Catan, all the way to obscure, highly intellectual games like \"Uno but with Extra Rules\" (yes, that\u2019s a real thing). The real joy is the endless variety in the Workshop. Want to play Twilight Struggle? Check. How about Risk... but with exploding dice? Check. An unholy mashup of Chess, Cards Against Humanity, and a trampoline? Yep, there\u2019s a mod for that.\n\nSure, it may occasionally glitch out when you're trying to stack cards (in this universe, cards do not want to stack), or your friend inevitably flips the table during the game of Exploding Kittens (always a classic), but these are the endearing quirks of Tabletop Simulator.\n\nThe physics engine? It's a mess. And I love it. Need to knock over an entire stack of cards for no reason? You can do that. Want to send your pawn flying across the table as an \"accident\"? Perfect. The chaos is truly unparalleled. If you're looking for an extremely realistic simulation of throwing dice and pieces across your living room, you've come to the right place.\n\nAs for the community? Well, some Workshop mods are lovingly crafted, others... are less so (looking at you, Uno with gravity). But hey, it's all part of the fun. Plus, playing with random strangers means you get to practice your patience... and your ability to pretend you didn\u2019t just spill an entire deck of cards by accident.\n\nIn conclusion, Tabletop Simulator is a perfect place for people who love board games and have no fear of chaos or broken friendships. It's a little clunky, a little glitchy, and often a lot of frustration, but in a fun way. And after 827 hours, I can confidently say: this is where I want to be. (Though I really should work on my actual social skills\u2026)\n\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to knock over another table.
