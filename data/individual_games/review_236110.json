The game has been out for almost a decade now and still receives updates to this day yet its not enough.\n\nLet me start with the fact that the game is very difficult to start at. It is very anti-beginner friendly. My first approach to the game ended in a single session because I got overwhelmed. Not gonna lie, the game gave me a weak first impression. It didn\u2019t make me want to play or discover more. Only because I gave the game a second chance and put a few hours with a leap of faith, I was able to discover what it is about and it is about grinding the hell out of it. The beginning of the game is simply boring. Not much effort went into it and it shows. The campaign gives you an idea of the basics but it doesn\u2019t teach you anything else. There are a ton of things that are available to you but they lack explanation or introductions. There is a ton you have to figure out on your own. That\u2019s why I think that the campaign could as well go to the trash can. We need something else, we need something better.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is completely broken. There is a glitch that when you load into a match, you can load with exactly 1 gear score. I believe it changed my gear score mid-game at least once too. It doesn\u2019t matter what gear you currently have equipped, the glitch will cause it to be at a minimum level making you unable to play. As far as my research goes, there is no solution to this problem so when that happens, your only option is to leave the match and try again in either the same lobby or some other hoping it won\u2019t glitch out again. Imagine my irritation when I was trying to set up a game earlier today and it glitched out like that probably close to 30 times in a row\u2026 I am not kidding nor am I exaggerating. I found mentions of the glitch dating back to 2019. Despite the game being constantly updated, it is full of problems that nobody bothers to take care of and it leaves us very little hope that those will ever be fixed. \n\nAnother problem I would like to mention is closely related to monsters and bosses. They have a tendency to glitch out at the entrances of their spawning zones making them stuck. After I got a better understanding of the game, I wanted to accomplish a total semi-afk experience where I would only be checking on the game to start another round. This is what the already mentioned grind looks like for the most part. It was supposed to help me with setup for the last achievement as well as with farming in-game resources. I couldn\u2019t even do that because the mobs kept getting stuck outside of my tower\u2019s reach. In order to make them unstuck you have to go to the edge of their spawning zones and aggro them onto you so that they start chasing you and get unstuck. This is very annoying and wastes a lot of time. I can\u2019t even trust the game to leave it unattended for a moment without something going wrong\u2026\n\nIn summary, I had a lot of positive moments with the game as well as with the people I randomly met while playing the game. There were moments that will stay with me as nice memories. Unfortunately, the positives quickly got overwhelmed by the amount of negatives I was facing every session. The deeper I got into the end game, the more issues I was experiencing. In the current state, the game is unplayable and I cannot recommend it. Judging by how long these issues had already been present, I worry that they will never be resolved\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1735743814, "timestamp_updated": 1737074437, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656676530838012695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184435514": {"recommendationid": "184435514", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980017868", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1451426310}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played a LOT of the first game in this series.

There's no transparency or fair appeal process, making the game feel unsafe to invest time in.\n\nHostile Discord Environment: The official Discord server is a mess. If you disagree with the developers or moderators, you're immediately targeted and insulted by both staff and community members.\n\nPlayer Identity Abuse: There are people actively impersonating skilled players, using their names to scam others or spread fake screenshots to damage reputations. The developers have done little to address this issue, which only worsens the toxic environment.\n\nUnresponsive Developers: Trying to contact the developers is pointless. Messages go unanswered, and there's no indication that any complaints or reports ever reach a manager or are properly addressed.\n\nUnless drastic changes are made to the management and moderation of the community, I can't recommend this game to anyone.

For example, my friend had 1 adventure map left to do and we had to look up how to see what the last map was in an obscure menu. That map that was listed was nowhere in the adventure tab so we had to guess.\n- a kind of overwhelming about of shops in the lobby that aren't really explained at all and seem irrelevant for the beginning of the game (was this because I bought the game when it came out ages ago? not sure)\n\nOn top of the confusing issues, you can swipe your credit card on just about anything (buying gold, unlocking characters, powering up your gear/weapons, battle pass, bag tabs, etc etc) and playing solo seems a lot harder than playing with a group (at least at the beginning of the game). There have also been a lot of UI bugs (tutorial text staying on the screen forever) and wonky/bugged out numbers on gear that seem to fix themselves if you restart.\n\nEven with all of these problems that have driven me absolutely insane over the last week lol, this game is still a free co-op tower defense game that looks pretty good and has fun levels and characters. You get to play 4 characters at a time and swap between them during the matches which is enjoyable for strategy setup. Once you get to the very easy/low level cap all of your characters level at once which is a relief. It still gets updated and seems to have an active community. The pay to win is there if you want to skip grinding I suppose, but if you want to defend some dungeons with your pals and have something to grind at this is definitely that game.
