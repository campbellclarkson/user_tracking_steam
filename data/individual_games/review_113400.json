The current owners have only added 2 new vehicles (which they sell on the armas marketplace, of course!), 1 new contact for each faction, and a new no-name anti-cheat.  Don't bother and go play GTA Online instead.\n\nNew player experience is still horrible, this causes a lack of new player retention and therefore completely unbalanced match-making and therefore a lack of new player retention. This ends up creating a game-balance where a handful of ultra-geared high level players repeatedly stomp new players who don't know enough about how the game works. Low-player counts have also made matchmaking very very slow, and often the game has you join another server (and loading screen) just to be able to find a match.\n\nProgression is also horrible. New-players are forced to grind out to get anywhere, only to realise many of the coolest items are 100-200 hours in and are put off. Of course many of these items are still locked in the armas marketplace, for pretty extortionate prices. If you really want to see the best the game has to offer, just buy a Vegas G20 kit + vehicle bundle. Then you'll realise that you can drive across the entire map in less than 2 minutes and realise how boring this game really is.\n\nGraphics seemingly haven't been touched since the games launch nearly 15 years ago. The render distance is awful and every prop in the game will pop in about 5 metres in front of you. Many of the buildings are obviously copy-pasted and the map is full of strange geometry glitches that clearly haven't been fixed since launch. As stated earlier, the map is absolutely tiny. The game takes place in 2 main districts and each are the same size. You will very quickly get bored of how few mission objectives there are. The customisation is still pretty good, but even on 'maximum' it looks awful and pixelated. Don't expect to be able to customise any of the 'noob' cars either, all of the body kits are for the top-tier vehicles only. It's possible to earn in-game some through 'joker tickets' but the pricing makes it obvious what they are pushing you towards.\n\nIn regards to new content, it's obvious the devs aren't putting in the time to create it and are more interested in extending the games life-span just long enough to make a profit. They added a new car over 2 years ago (onto the armas store, of course) and haven't bothered to release any customisation for it. You'd think in the past 15 years one of the games owners would have added some new substantial content, like motorcycles, quadbikes, heists, businesses, solo missions, map expansions, PVE, more types of crime, races. But the game is pretty much the same as it was at launch.\n\nSo what have the current owners been doing? Aside from less than the bare minimum of new content, adding a crappy off-brand anti-cheat, they've been 'upgrading the engine'. A whopping update from 32 to 64 bit. Not that the game looks, plays or feels any different. They've also sold off the APB IP to a random chinese holding company, so don't expect a sequel. The only real activity the game gets is regular Armas marketplace sales. To keep the game alive, the developers have been giving out free premium to all players. The premium is mostly focused on the customisation aspect of the game, but also gives players extra bonus money for completing missions etc. I believe at some point in the next 5 years, once the player count hits the sub 100 mark (most of whom will be AFK anyway), the owners will shut down the servers once and for good so don't spend any significant amount of money.\n\nwhy do i use the term 'owners' instead of 'devs' in my review? because the owners of this game don't do any development for it, thats why. they are just a holding company who keeps the servers on.\n\nEDIT: since this game is dying off, many players are now completely blocked from progression due to low playerbase in some districts. game is now essentially UNPLAYABLE and the owners have NO plans to address it.",

Best to play it with a heavy hitting music. \nSo try it!\nAlso it improved a lot (more on that later). \n\nWhy it's Good: \nGame Play: \n-At its Core: GTA stile Cops Vs Criminals. [It's Good stuff they don't make no more] \n-When the Action happens it Will KICK YOU!\n-It is Lots of fun.\n-Not meant for immature Audiences! It's the good \"Old School\" Variant!\n\n-You have seen character Customization? \nNo you did not! \nThis Game is Old And Dose it 30 Dimensions better than All the games that claim to have Good Character customisation.\nYou will Spend DAYS character customisation if that's your thing.\n\nA Lot of Nice Features for Customization and personalization!\nCustomize it ALL!\n-Your Character, \n-Individual Pieces of clothing! \n-Your CAR \n-Your LOGO\n-Your OWN THEME MUSIC!\n-The Music your Raidio PLAYS! (Car or not)\n\nAdd stat Mods to your Character Weapons and Car.\n\nYou truly make \"Your\" Character in this game!\n\nSteep learning curve!!!\nYou are good at COD and the likes? \nHA you are To SLOW then!! Turn back.\nYou play Counter Strike? \nWell, you may have the reflexes then.\n\n\n\nSo a bit of a Backstory: \nI Played a lot back in the day. \nBut over time it accumulated some major issues. \nTo name the heavy hitters: \n\n-It had a Hacker issue. APB-R used back then Easy Anti-Cheat.\n\n-It had outdated Net-Code. I swear, lag's Always came at the most inconvenient times.\n\n-It was horribly Pay To Win. Back then you could get overpowered weapons out of loot boxes (the chances were low). Now no more!\n\n\n\nSo did things Chang since Back then? \nABSOLUTELY!\nI am in WLAN and the Net-Code is CRISP!! \nI am not sure how they pulled this off but for the time i played it now, it worked out well.\n\nHow about the Hacker issue?\nI haven't noticed it for the time being. So it's good for now?\n\nAbout the legendary-Supper-Weapons.\nNow here is a solution i have to praise, they changed it so that anyone can rent them with a Secondary ingame currency that you get from doing quests and as rewards. \nI have to note, you can buy that currency with real money to. But that kinda is the monetary model. \nThe Rent price is not Unreasonable.\nWith each Rent of the Waepon you increase the chance of permanently getting the legendary Supper weapon. \nSo there is a Statistical Cap. \nWhich is Leagues better compeard to the previous Loot-Box draw chance to get those guns.\n\n\nSo it massively improved!", "timestamp_created": 1735940396, "timestamp_updated": 1736778673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184632403": {"recommendationid": "184632403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104798321", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1735907011}, "language": "german", "review": "L\u00e4uft nicht.
