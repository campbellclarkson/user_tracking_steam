This was one of the few games i discovered on my phone that kept me sane for those months; And, clearly, this game is so good i bought it again.\nThis is a bona fide arcade zombie game. \n\n    For a funny game with such a cool retro \"arcadey\" style, BANGING music, and references n jokes galore, if you are caught late at night, and you're not prepared, you WILL have 50 or more (no exaggeration) zombies just PILING through the door. They even \"grab\" you within a certain proximity, and you HAVE to either hit them away, or RUN away, because if they grab you for those 3 seconds, you will lose some health. If you happen to get caught in the worst-case scenario, your body WILL be swarmed, and eaten alive down to the bones, being reduced to a distraction for the rest of your crazy and... \"eccentric\" crew to slip through to an exit or the car.\n\n     You collect gas, food, medical supplies, and weapons, and do everything you can in a random neighborhood, full of rubble blocking the roads and some doorways, junk cars, and abandoned, zombie-filled buildings. Every weapon you grab will either be a jab, a swing, a BIG swing (i.e a sledge hammer, knocking multiple zombies down at once), or a *bang bang*, with different damage stats, stamina-usage, and durability. But you're not just limited to your golf clubs and shotguns, you can even pick up furniture, and throw it right at the rotten faces of your opponents! You WILL be doing this, and anything else you can, to hold them off or thin down their numbers just enough to slip through that doorway, survive a siege, and just simply survive.\n\n    Every character you find has a series of stats and traits, including but not limited to: Mechanical (for fixing your car), shooting, Strength, even \"loyalty\" - aka, how likely they are to NOT leave you behind or betray you when it's opportune for them (when their morale stat is so low they can't take the stress anymore). Along this, they can have 2 traits, they could be a paranoid shooter who has bonus shooting stats, and is always suspicious of people and situations, allowing them to \"read a person's\" stats before you uncover their stats the HARD way. You could have someone that wants to join your crew, CLAIM to be a mechanic, but your paranoid character reads that they actually have NO mechanical skill WHATSOEVER! You could be an athletic \"BERSERKER!!\" where you start off with INSANE strength stats, but are cranky, mean to people (which could even get you killed!!!) and DIE in 1 hit! You could have an irritating martial artist, a charming pyromaniac, a sharpshooting gungineer, you can be a dog...\n\nYou can be a dog :)\n\nNo but actually, you can be a dog. It's amazing, they can only carry ONE thing, in their mouth, but they can still loot, and have the highest speed, meaning you can use them to ZIP past zombies, loot a room, and run back out. \n\n    I didn't even get into all the possible outcomes you encounter while on the road (or while on foot), and the different possible zombie-riddled locations you can choose based on what materials you need most. For a 15 buck (and currently 3 dollar) roguelike arcade game, it has SO many amazing things packed into this title.\n \n    The music will always keep you hooked, every zombie has a very detailed and uniquely-grotesque or funny face, and so many upgrades, traits, perks, and other game modes to keep yourself preoccupied with this title for many, many hours and more. \n\n    My only complaint taking this game from a 10 to a 9/10 is that there is no online multiplayer support, only couch co-op, meaning your only online option is to use some sort of Remote Play, which is either a huge hit or total miss depending on your internet, hardware, and other weird little factors.\n\n     But if you DO happen to have some friends coming over, I don't care their level of skill when it comes to gaming, EVERYONE is going to have the time of their lives making their way to the grate maple gates of Canada, because I know I already have a blast playing on my own!", "timestamp_created": 1735840933, "timestamp_updated": 1735841175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546079754829406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184550981": {"recommendationid": "184550981", "author": {"steamid": "76561199683131257", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1734053537}, "language": "english", "review": "Generally a good game but its very short and it gets a bit repetitive. 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1735840210, "timestamp_updated": 1735840210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184543445": {"recommendationid": "184543445", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229485542", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1753, "last_played": 1736195017}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will give you many, many hours of playtime.\r\nand the fact that it supports windows, Mac and Linux is really good, because not many games support Mac and Linux. the game is also very light so almost any system can handle it.\r\nin conclusion if you like Rouge likes, than I would recommend giving this game a try.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735834871, "timestamp_updated": 1735834871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184542327": {"recommendationid": "184542327", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215070793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1964, "last_played": 1735834901}, "language": "schinese", "review": "AI\u5c31\u662f\u5f31\u667a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1735834062, "timestamp_updated": 1735834062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184540275": {"recommendationid": "184540275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277963632", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1735833616}, "language": "english", "review": "The music slaps, the zombie gore is lovely.
