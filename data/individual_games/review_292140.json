I recommend this game, but there are some major issues that will keep people away.\n\nThe main thing is just getting the game to work. On steam deck I never had any issues, my desktop however I had to do some work first. The game would not boot. I had to download the 4gb fix patch. Then I had a buzzing audio bug that needed more fixing. Still the game sometimes needs to be started multiple times before it works. This game came out in a time when SE had god awful ports. The newer FF games have none of these issues.\n\nThe difficulty overall seems easier than XIII. This game still has the weird hard AF difficulty spikes out of nowhere. Only thing I can think that explains this is that the game wants you to come back later and fight them. You will go from understanding and making good progress, to just instantly deleted. \n\nThe quest design is super confusing at times. FFXVI did a great job with marking where to go and what NPCs give side quests. This game will have you running around aimlessly trying to figure out where to go next. \n\nThe story is an abortion. This game pretty much makes XIII's ending useless. If you like that ending, just don't play this game because it destroys everything with the stupid time travel bs. How hard is it not to make a ridiculous, contradicting story full of plot holes? \n\nIf this game had better writing, quest design, and combat it would be one of my favorites.

You can find all of the instructions and links in this guide: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038838545]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038838545[/url] It is very easy to do and only takes about 5 minutes. I did this before my first playthrough and experienced zero performance issues.\n\nAs a huge fan of Lightning Returns, I figured it was about time I played this game as well. Boy am I glad I finally did. Serah and Noel are genuinely great characters and its fun to watch their interactions throughout the game. I always found myself looking forward to unlocking the next areas just to see their reactions. The story is a little generic at parts but I loved every bit of it. Even after playing Lightning Returns multiple times, I was still surprised by this game's ending\n\nThe combat is also great; I was weary at first since I had played a bit of XIII in the past and really disliked the combat. This game seemed to have fixed the issues in XIII (such as slow paradigm shifts and little customization) and added some extra improvements, like being able to capture monsters and add them to your team. \n\nThe Crystarium leveling system makes grinding more rewarding in my opinion. Its fun to go through a bunch of battles and see how many points you racked up to level up your team. Not to mention the addition of fragment skills that allow you to manipulate factors such as how frequently you encounter enemies or how often rare enemies appear. The schemata system is also effective and easy to understand.\n\nMy only real negatives with this game are the side quests and anomaly puzzles. Many of the side quests are fetch quests that require you to find and return an item. These quickly get repetitive and boring. The anomaly puzzles are a fun addition, but I found the clock puzzles to be too difficult and ended up using an online tool to complete them.\n\nI highly recommend this game even if you have not played any of the XIII entries. The story is easy to follow, the characters are lovable, the combat is fun, the environments are beautiful, and the soundtrack is amazing.

It is pilled high with reasons not to, a few big ones which may turn you off could be:\n\nThe game requires external patching to get running stably because Square Enix don't understand how to port to PC, and this is from the early era of there ports so they also didn't care very much about the PC market.\nThe plot is absolutely insane, character motivations are simplistic and often pulled straight from the JRPG trope bin with little thought or care.\n100%ing the game requires a lot of tedious side-quests which should have been cut entirely.\n\nSo why do I recommend it?\n\nThis game lets have the most fun with the paradigm system because it is unlocked from the start. You get build a pack of swap-able monsters who take up the third slot so shifting paradigms also can shift an entire party member. There is a lot of depth here, in terms of how you level your characters and what monsters you use, level up and when you should infuse them into newer monsters to pass on key passive or active skills. It becomes a fun little game play loop.\n\nThe music, while atypical of final fantasy in several places, showed a willingness to experiment with genres and sounds in a Square game (something they are normally unwilling to do) and the visual design is solid for a game from 2011. Is the faux-death metal boss encounter theme for everyone? No, but I love that they tried.\n\nI also like the plot. It's terrible but in a bizarrely charming way because you know all the hilarious or ironic moments are unintentional. This isn't a shit writer claiming that writing a bad story intentionally makes it good and then claiming that their one ironic idea justifies a bland experience. This is a team of writers who tell you straight faced that if you change the future you change the past because of time travel. Or that if you scream loud enough in the future someone in the past will hear you and change their perspective. \n\nAnd so, you laugh. \n\nYou laugh because the professional voice actors intone the most non-nonsensical gibberish with the solemnity of a grand Shakespearean drama and that the writers at Square thought that this was, if not great, then at least compelling or good rather than stupid. And that complete lack of awareness, or unprofessional delivery from the actors, make it oddly compelling. You want to see way insane train of logic your characters jump on because the writers didn't know how to write a time travel story. You want to see how fumbling and awkward the dialogue can get because they introduced the most basic of dialogue selection during non-essential conversations and they filled with bizarre anime answers.\n\nSo buy it one sale, install the 4G patch so the memory leak doesn't cause the game the crash and enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1735948972, "timestamp_updated": 1735982743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184617570": {"recommendationid": "184617570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264897071", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1735902262}, "language": "english", "review": "This is so ridiculous, they are making the best ff series unplayable.

FF-13-2 is a horrendous PC port, this game absolutely will not work out of the box without applying fan fixes and mods. Without fixes it'll likely crash either during most cut-scenes or just crash every 10-15 minutes.  \n\nThere's a guide on steam with a list of all fixes to get the game running on modern hardware and with those installed I only had a single crash in all my time playing, then rarely a brief stutter when loading into a new area for the 1st time.\n\nIf you correctly apply the fan fixes and get the game working then I would argue that FF13-2 is one of if not the most underrated FF game, it fixes practically every major issue I had with 13.\n\nThe game maps are no longer 90% straight corridors and completely linear for 30+ hours.\n\nYou don't instantly game over if the party leader is downed.\n\nMonsters actually drop gil now when you beat them.\n\n13-2 doesn't take an additional 5+ hours of grinding the same 6 second fight over and over to max out all characters after you've 100% the rest of the game.\n\nThe pacing is no longer abyssal, in FF-13 you don't unlock paradigm shifting until chapter 3, many hours into the story, in 13-2 you start with it unlocked straight away.\n\n13-2 features Loads of varied side quests and activities instead of just the 64 stone battles and I guess the chocobo treasure hunts seen in 13.\n\n13-2 features a monster taming & training system where you can capture most enemies you encounter who act as your 3rd party member.\n\nThe main antagonist is fantastic, easily one of the best written in the whole series. \n\nI personally wasn't a big fan of the FF-13 OST, it has a few amazing songs but in general it's very whelming.  13-2 has one of the best soundtracks of the series with banger after banger.\n\n\nIt's a real shame how bad of a port this game is cause overall FF-13-2 is a really good game, it's a massive improvement over FF-13 but players should not be expected to need mods and fan patches to run a relatively recent game publish by bloody Square Enix. \n", "timestamp_created": 1735274711, "timestamp_updated": 1735274711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664104819297790527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183829471": {"recommendationid": "183829471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198914038410", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1735271265}, "language": "brazilian", "review": " N\u00e3o consegui jogar o jogo.
