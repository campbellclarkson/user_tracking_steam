The thumbs down is because I wanted to like this game more than I did. Some of the hours are just leaving the game online and reading a ton online.\n\nThe good;\n\n1) I love it when a game offers more than one character to play as. In a strategic warfare game like this, I like that it offers a big choice of nations to choose from with different units. Each nation has its lore entry and the units have some descriptions to get you into the atmosphere.\n\n2) There are a LOT of magic spells in this game. It's almost too many and it definitely feels overwhelming. But some of the systems are genuinely interesting and unique. Magic includes combat spells, rituals performed outside of combat and forging magic items.\n\n3) A deep system for those interested.\n\nThe bad;\n\n1) The interface is absolutely atrocious. It's not just minimalist, it is lacking in a way that I can only understand as laziness or lack of interest from the developers. Clearly it's working for the loyal fan base considering this is the 5th game in the series and there's currently a 6th. The first time I saw how obtrusive managing everything is I was surprised cause it seemed like the kind of flaw an indie on their first game would make, not someone on their 5th game.\n\n2) The learning curve is HIGH. Half the time I've spent \"playing\" this game is reading the online wiki, the manual or looking up videos online which are very detailed. This might work for some, but I would rather spend it playing. Also, there's absolutely no tutorial to tell you how the game works.\n\n3) I would be willing to overlook the lacking interface, the deep/high learning curve, the lack of a tutorial and the overwhelming systems of magic, but the thing that kind of makes me stop playing the game is how \"dry\" it is. When you play in single player there's a lore entry for the nation you play as, and there's a generic victory text that's the same for all nations. That's it. There's nothing in-between, no specific victory text for any nation or for the diety you play as. It's pretty much a digitized board game with some graphics.\n\nIs this game bad? No, I wouldn't say so. It's clearly flawed by modern-gaming standards, but it's deep and there's a lot of attention paid here along with a great and interesting magic system. But it's absolutely not for everyone. I'm not upset that I got it because I got it for real cheap. I'm hoping in the future a Dominions game is released that's much more accessible and inviting.\n\nOh, by the way.
