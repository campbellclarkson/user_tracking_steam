This is probably the best game in the series alongside with Disgaea 5. I played this game well over 250+ hours on my PS2 and 180+ hours here on Steam. This PC version is an improved version of the PS2, with HD hud and text and some extra content too.\r\n\r\nMy overall score: 4.2 / 5 --- Highly recommended if you're a fan of JRPGs, tactical RPGs, grinding, min-maxing, etc.\r\n\r\nGameplay: 4/5\r\nGreat tactical game, fast paced. It can be approached in two different ways: 1. You can play it casually, just to finish the story and that's it; 2. You can play it hardcore, grinding like crazy to explore all the post-game content (that is basically 95% of the game).\r\n\r\nGraphics: 3/5\r\nNothing special about it, just the improved hud and font.\r\n\r\nStory: 3/5\r\nIt's an interesting story with plot twists and fan-service, involving characters from the first game.\r\n\r\nReplayability: 5/5\r\nActually 100/5, because the game only really shines in the post-game (Item World, Land of Carnage, extra bosses, etc.). I really enjoyed the grinding on this game, and it's really accomplishing to see the numbers on your characters going up. I even perfected a Super Robo Suit following Ulillillia's guide (maximum respect for that dude).\r\n\r\nMusic: 5/5\r\nAwesome music. No surprise coming from a JRPG.\r\n\r\nPC Requirements: 5/5\r\nA toaster will do.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer: It's a single player game, so it doesn't apply.", "timestamp_created": 1735529966, "timestamp_updated": 1735529966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183865658": {"recommendationid": "183865658", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039824632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "playtime_at_review": 3635, "last_played": 1737169423}, "language": "english", "review": "Never gets old.
