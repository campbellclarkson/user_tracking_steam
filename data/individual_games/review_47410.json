You really do feel like you are a Lord ruling over your own villages in a bigger empire picture with all the other Lords and Ladys and helping your fellow players along the way.  In this game is where you can met people all over the world and you can help each other out. You can work together and fight together and its also great way to play with your friends too. \n  I also like how Stronghold has added more quest to to earn cards and wheel spins. Good job! I think it would be cool if Stronghold have automonks to send out cure disease or even bless of your own parishes. How about away to save you village like the way you save your castle? So all and all I have fun playing and excited about what new upgrades will come out next. \n Here is helpful tip, When its say \"steam needs to be online\" which steam is online, well don't threat do I as do.  Right click on the mini steam icon in the task bar and click on stronghold and play.

Since this game is multiplatform, i was able to continue my progress on phone. (+1 star for convenience)\n\nOverall is a mediocre or simplified Clash of Clans. Its enjoyable. You need to log in at least once in two weeks or your progress will be deleted. (+2 star)\n\nSo 3 stars right??? Average joe??\n\nBUT!! without the Premium Token, your progress will always be as hard as a constipated person. And Everything become slow overtime, like reaaal slow! I'm Talking about your village become a sick snail that will take 4-5 business days if you need just to build your hovel! But in my opinion, all of that still bearable. Albeit annoying (-1 star of course)\n\nWhat turns me off, is that the fact thateverytime you reach the last AGE (End of year) (means i have to work my ass of the whole year prior). The dominant / winning house /guild whatever...will have the opportunity to either end the game or continue that server game. (By design, Of course people will choose the \"End Game\" Button, it is designed to be tempting to choose!). \n\nIn the End, NEW YEAR MEANS YOU LOSE EVERYTHING AND START FROM THE BEGINNING! LIKE A BEGINNERS BEGINNING. All hard earned researches, gone. Cards you've used? Doesn't mean jacksh!t.\n\nWhy you want us to learn the hard way about yin and yang / dhamma wheel / reincarnation in medieval kingdom building sim game?\n\n\"Oopsies! People choose to end the game! now you have to start from  new realm and from the beginning. And need to spent more money on us to research again the same stuff you wait for months!!\"\n\nAll of that patience (+money) FOR NOTHING! Greed and off putting. \n(-2 stars)\n\nI cant give 0 stars.
