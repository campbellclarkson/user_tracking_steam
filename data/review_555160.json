update of UE5 has caused community maps to crash frequently, which is undoubtedly a disaster for map creators, and it will take a long time for the ecosystem of community maps to recover. The shift of dependencies from the Steam Workshop to Mod.io has also been a catastrophic blow to Chinese players, as mainland China has difficulty accessing Mod.io directly. The Chinese community has had to spend a lot of time modifying DNS and using VPNs, which has led to the loss of the already limited number of Chinese players.

If anything, each update was a downgrade rather than an innovation, accompanied by rapidly declining playerbase as a result. Pavlov is not dead, as many presume, but it deteriorates each year, besides performing \"better\" than similar titles.\n\nIt was really fun in the past, thus it is not worth buying today. Base game content doesn't provide the same value the modding content did. All major changes are unasked for and irreversible, every patch drags the game down and the community can only watch it happen in despair. It became a VR clone of Counter-strike and this decision alone made it lose all of the potential for future development. The mascot for this game looks like AI-generated nightmare, I still do not realize why it exist in the first place.\n\nRecoil is the highest among other VR shooters and it currently takes the most hits to kill an enemy as well. It doesn't mean that targets feel like bullet-sponges, but it rather allows for less cooperative, strategic and thought-out gameplay. You will find teammates and enemies rushing more, venturing solo often and generally communicating less because of this. It makes the game more self-centric than team-based in a sense.\n\nVirtual hands holding a gun feel like absolute noodles. You will benefit from an improvised or a professional gun rig: it provides you with better handing, immersion and an aspect of realism (like weight distribution, etc.). This goes for the majority of VR shooters that use both controllers for weapon interactions. You can still perform well without, it takes times and practice, however, the handling is still messy due to the lack of a physical constraint a rig can provide.", "timestamp_created": 1736165493, "timestamp_updated": 1736165493, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56790393590927124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184883730": {"recommendationid": "184883730", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055182704", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 555, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1735258240}, "language": "english", "review": "actually makes you feel badass", "timestamp_created": 1736121320, "timestamp_updated": 1736121320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184881490": {"recommendationid": "184881490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256380031", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 47206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 509, "playtime_at_review": 46477, "last_played": 1737348680}, "language": "english", "review": "The biggest difference for this game between other fps vr shooters is that it has no fluff. It's just raw gunplay which makes pvp more fun. The game is VERY forgiving with weapon handling unlike games like ghost of tabor or Onward.\n\nDon't listen to people complaining about modding. It is very much more accessible to players than before. Playstation will never get modding.

than this game I have refunded this game three times now, the reason why I bought it three times and then refunded three times is because I really did want to give this game a chance and i did gameplay wise slower contractors, just to be honest with you, you can't Crouch by pressing down on your right analog stick but you do have to physically get on the ground or crouched on one knee, hell you can even go prone, I gotta to say it's pretty immersive, but that's where all of fun ends,\n\nit's pretty lackluster, it's somewhat like contractors, it does have custom game modes, and maps but not full on conversions you won't be going to Star Wars, Warhammer, or TF2, in VR, like contractors does it's pretty down to earth to be honest, the Gunplay is somewhat awful, mind you a little bit better than contractors, it does punish you for spraying and praying i do like that, but that's where it ends to be honest, to me it's just lacking fun, and players, and more custom stuff, to be honest the whole nine yards,\n\nbut because every developer is chicken shit to even to try to make a decent VR game this will do, VR games are so far and few, and I can't find any other multiplayer VR games this WILL have to do, if I had to give this game a rating I'd give it a 5/10 (For the Love of Christ just buy contractors and skip this game all together if you can) (do I hate this game no do I find it not fun yes)\n\n(f you're seeing this review I am removing this game from my account and never playing this game again I just can't with this God awful game dude I just can't)",

I've dabbled in it on and off over the years and it's great seeing it develop further, turning into a CoD/CS VR game and modding support to boot, easily one of the best VR shooters I've played. But due to some technical issue it just will not load up for me. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, this is a problem with [b]my[/b] PC/headset, but hear me out. I've tried EVERYTHING the devs have posted, I've looked at countless posts with the same issue, some more than a year old with no solution, I've reinstalled, deleted the appdata folder, verified files, deleted workshop content, reinstalled a few more times, deleted the appdata folder a few more times, but it just hangs on a black screen. I did get it to boot into the game's opening screen maybe twice but it just freezes up after. I've completely given up on trying to get it to work, I just cannot be bothered with it anymore.\r\nThe reason I'm giving it a thumbs down for an issue only myself and a handful of others are struggling with is because of some of the solutions to other problems that I found on their official wiki.\r\nThings like \"[i]If you have a very old steam profile picture try changing it to current steam dimensions and standards without transparency.[/i]\" and \"[i]Another reported solution is going into your system clock, and resetting it. Set your date and time to synchronize on windows.[/i]\"\r\nIt made me wonder if the solution was to do something so incredibly obscure that would take me an unknown length of time to find. A new steam photo? rearrange my monitors? Change my keyboards lights to a hot pink between the hours of 9am - 6pm?\r\n\r\nThese random solutions say to me that there's a serious flaw in the way this game is built if it can be bugged out by steam profile photos and resetting my PC's clock to fix a teleporting issue. I've never heard of such things being the cause of a game either being buggy or straight-up not starting. \r\n\r\nThere's a serious problem with the foundations of this game and I sincerely hope they patch it up because I miss playing this.", "timestamp_created": 1735409293, "timestamp_updated": 1735409293, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184007174": {"recommendationid": "184007174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161863658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1698720821}, "language": "english", "review": "Removed the ability to use mods off the steam workshop making it just more tedious to get mods and more annoying to actually launch them.
