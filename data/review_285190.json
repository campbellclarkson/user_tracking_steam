The game offers three distinct factions\u2014Space Marines, Orks, and Eldar\u2014each with unique playstyles, units, and special abilities that encourage varied approaches to combat. Its campaign provides a well-paced introduction to each faction, weaving a narrative of alliances and betrayals that captures the tone of the Warhammer universe.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, with highly detailed units, spectacular special effects, and battlefield environments that bring the dark and chaotic world of Warhammer 40K to life. The large-scale battles feel appropriately epic, with massive units like Imperial Knights and Wraithknights adding a sense of grandeur to combat. Meanwhile, the voice acting and sound design further enhance the immersive experience, from the booming battle cries of Orks to the solemn chants of Space Marines.\n\nHowever, Dawn of War III takes risks that may divide fans. Its gameplay leans heavily on MOBA-inspired mechanics, such as the focus on hero units and a heavy reliance on abilities, which may not appeal to players seeking the tactical depth of its predecessors. Base-building, while present, is simplified compared to earlier entries, and the multiplayer mode, while engaging, lacks some of the refinement found in other RTS games.\n\nDespite these divisive elements, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III shines in its presentation and ability to deliver cinematic, large-scale battles. While it may not fully satisfy the expectations of every fan of the franchise, it remains a bold and visually impressive entry in the series that offers plenty of action and spectacle for those willing to embrace its unique gameplay direction.", "timestamp_created": 1737376007, "timestamp_updated": 1737376007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185907016": {"recommendationid": "185907016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001523449", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "playtime_at_review": 5631, "last_played": 1737255051}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game but buy it on sale.

Game visually looks really polished, smooth, mostly really stunning for RTS but this is not Warhammer 40k. Animation, some of the proportions of units, cartoony style, all this kills the atmosphere of what this game should be. Game doesn't offer anything new and tries to utilize some of the mechanics from Company of Heroes and previous Dawn of Wars but in a really lame way possible. Somewhat lazy. It fails to deliver a good, engaging experience, bringing something really new to gameplay. It doesn't even sound like Warhammer 40k 95% of time. Multiplayer is boring and only offers Space Marines, Orcs and Eldars poorly balanced between each other and between game stages. Campaign is lame and forces you to play a boring story that artificially last forever and forces you to play all this \"huge\" variety of races in \"a not so grimdark future\". Oh jeez, the last mission will be your longest ever boss fight in your gaming history, believe me. I bet Sekiro or Dark Souls are jealous about how this game nailed a big boss encounter.\r\nMaybe one day we will get the ideal Dawn of War IV, that absolute setting and RTS innovations or give it a new refresh, but for now...just wait for the biggest sale and be prepared to waste about 20-30 hours on something that won't even reward you for this time and money investment.\r\nConclusion: It would be a great game in Warhammer 40k, despite its problems, if it only had proper support and a bit of love from developers but instead it's abandoned before arrival and developed as a concept and not a finished product. Potential was huge here, especially with all previous ideas of Dawn of War and how other studios maintain their RTSes.
