This game is basically an upgraded version of Total War Shogun 1. Everything is similar, but better. My personal recommendations what to play in the game are: Europe Campaign at least 1 time, The Vikings Campaign at least 1 time, all Historical Campaigns.\r\n\r\nThis game has amazing music. Really feels like you're waging war in medieval times. Visuals are also amazing, especially notifications that something significant has happened in the world. I liked the fact that if there were any famous writers or culturally significant events, they would appear as notifications during the European campaign.\r\n\r\nI do need to mention 1 drawback though, at least in my opinion. Total War Medieval 1 Europe Campaign is much slower than its' predecessor Shogun 1 Sengoku Jidai Campaign. European campaign on expert difficulty is almost too long and it's very tedious to carefully take care of all of your cities, move armies. You will have a lot of armies, much more than any future Total War games let you generally build financially. The fact that you need to keep units practically in all provinces in the game, because of the loyalty. Personally, it felt to me like the European Campaign was way too slow and tedious. I had a lot more fun in The Vikings Campaign and in the Historical Campaigns.\r\n\r\nAnd as usual, Historical Campaigns deserve a separate mention. Bravo. I liked it a lot. Absolutely amazing design in a lot of missions. I enjoyed every fight and it was great. Historical Campaigns were great even in Shogun 1, but in Medieval 1 developers definitely outperformed themselves and did a lot of improvements and the experience became even better.", "timestamp_created": 1736555026, "timestamp_updated": 1736555026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184705186": {"recommendationid": "184705186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183635335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1736126520}, "language": "english", "review": "Ride into battle, king gets killed.
