No entanto, o modo como o jogo lida com seu humor e narrativas acaba muitas vezes cruzando a linha entre ser espirituoso e ser for\u00e7ado ou at\u00e9 embara\u00e7oso. O humor \u00e9 exageradamente pastel\u00e3o e parece mais interessado em bancar o \"cool\" do que em realmente oferecer uma hist\u00f3ria envolvente ou respeit\u00e1vel.\r\n\r\nA arte, embora estilizada, \u00e9 simples demais para justificar o pre\u00e7o do jogo, e os di\u00e1logos frequentemente soam artificiais, como se estivessem tentando agradar a um p\u00fablico espec\u00edfico a qualquer custo, sem preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com a profundidade ou qualidade narrativa. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil se conectar a qualquer um dos personagens, pois todos parecem caricaturas em vez de pessoas reais, o que torna o aspecto \"relacionamento\" do jogo superficial e vazio.\r\n\r\nO maior problema, entretanto, \u00e9 o tom geral do jogo. Em vez de explorar relacionamentos de forma sincera, Dream Daddy frequentemente soa como uma piada esticada demais, que joga com estere\u00f3tipos de maneira desconfort\u00e1vel e, em certos momentos, chega a ser de mau gosto. H\u00e1 uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o persistente de que o jogo est\u00e1 mais interessado em explorar um nicho exc\u00eantrico do que em criar algo significativo ou respeitoso.\r\n\r\nPor fim, Dream Daddy \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia que, para mim, n\u00e3o conseguiu alcan\u00e7ar seus objetivos de maneira digna.

My favourite part was the relationship we have with our daughter, Amanda: You really get the strong impression that while yes, you are out there dating other dads, your main priority in life is being a father to your kid. and to support her through all challenges growing up. (The other dads have this too, but of course this gets less of a focus than your relationship with Amanda. Still, you have the strong impression that the \"Dream DADdy\" isn't just a gimmick, but that being a dad is a huge part of the characters' lives and that being there for their children shapes a huge part of who they are.)", "timestamp_created": 1735282833, "timestamp_updated": 1735282833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183846663": {"recommendationid": "183846663", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122128672", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1735825896}, "language": "english", "review": "i seek out love from other fathers because i never got any from my own", "timestamp_created": 1735277755, "timestamp_updated": 1735277755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183796743": {"recommendationid": "183796743", "author": {"steamid": "76561199415271382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1735166258}, "language": "english", "review": "games grump", "timestamp_created": 1735249370, "timestamp_updated": 1735249370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183693245": {"recommendationid": "183693245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240899022", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1735424112}, "language": "english", "review": "You can thank this game for the existence of Neil Granger and Amanda Jones as they currently exist.", "timestamp_created": 1735163960, "timestamp_updated": 1735163960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183610548": {"recommendationid": "183610548", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033203479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1028, "last_played": 1735086455}, "language": "english", "review": "The MC is so fucking stupid oh my god.
