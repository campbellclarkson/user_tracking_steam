Granted, I was still in my Call of Duty on console phase when this masterpiece released, and I was too young and stupid to look away from the constant mediocre console shooter. Buyer beware, DR2 & DR2: Off the Record are NOT the same game!\n\nI played this game mainly with a friend, which was a ton of fun honestly. One of the best things to do is run around the mall and make our characters as stupid as possible with all the available options. Fighting bosses while Chuck is dressed like a country hooker has got to be the best experience. For a mall, the shops, characters, and casinos you mess around with are so colorful that you don't feel like you're walking in the same hallway through the whole game. The place is full of landmarks that you can figure out where you're going without a map if you pay attention enough!\n\nCrafting weapons is very intuitive, but since it was my first game I ended up looking up which weapons can create fun things, which is fine by me. The dismemberment and zombie AI isn't as good as a game like Left 4 Dead 2, but at the same time it doesn't need to be; rather than killing zombies all the time, your best bet is to simply carve out a path to travel from one objective to another, since they are TIME BASED. My buddy and I forgot about that, and roughly 15% into the main story, we ended up restarting because not only did we fuck up, but our last checkpoint was also right before we fucked up! While frustrating, we knew what we were getting into. Definitely not as frustrating as Yakuza 0 or Kiwami, where the telephone booths are your ONLY way of saving. You do save in a bathroom in these games, so Frank and Chuck must have their tummies brappin' like a Mazda Quad-Rotor engine.\n\nOverall, great time with a friend, I cannot recommend this enough.", "timestamp_created": 1737048227, "timestamp_updated": 1737048227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185690051": {"recommendationid": "185690051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424517697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1737089224}, "language": "english", "review": "I sure wish they would fix their game", "timestamp_created": 1737002491, "timestamp_updated": 1737002491, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185641357": {"recommendationid": "185641357", "author": {"steamid": "76561199220980168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 1006, "last_played": 1736943037}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4e45\u3057\u3076\u308a\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u8d77\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u3089\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u4e00\u5207\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u53c2\u8003\u306bsteam\u5165\u529b\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u308a\u7121\u52b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f\u304c\u307e\u3063\u305f\u304f\u53cd\u5fdc\u305b\u305a\u3002\u4eca\u66f4\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u306a\u3093\u304b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u306d\u30fc\u306e\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u3066\u304b\u30892\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7d4c\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059\u304c\u8fd4\u91d1\u4f9d\u983c\u3002\n\u5bfe\u5fdcOS\u3082\u53e4\u3044\u307e\u307e\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3088\u30ab\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u3088\u304a", "timestamp_created": 1736943510, "timestamp_updated": 1736943510, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185538121": {"recommendationid": "185538121", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126446742", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 109, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1737316222}, "language": "english", "review": "couldn't invite friend reached safe house still wouldn't work dog shit game i have zero brain cells left i am just as bad as the zombies also big monkehh touched my anal hole don't recommend \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736804507, "timestamp_updated": 1736804507, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185360858": {"recommendationid": "185360858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984649861", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1736042947}, "language": "english", "review": "DR2:OTR is a game best enjoyed after playing DR1 and DR2.
