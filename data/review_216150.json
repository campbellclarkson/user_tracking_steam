The gameplay is uninspiring, providing nothing of entertainment, resembling much more of a cookie clicker for the majority of the gameplay, and only really needing you to time a couple things in the most difficult parts. The most difficult and complex parts of the game can only be compared to the most average gameplay of undertale, or any indie game (especially considering how much money Nexon makes\u2026).\n\nAt least one must enjoy looking at the game, right? No. Maplestory\u2019s little development put into the actual game translates to the fidelity of a subpar game released in early 2000\u2019s that somehow survived this long (often through sunken cost). Notifications, damage numbers, hurt and hitboxes, they all are overlapping and unoptimized creating for a low graphical fidelity experience that even some of the most dedicated casual players would struggle with. \n\nAnd that is not even on the graphics. The chibi art style is, in my personal opinion, not doing any favors. Added with the low quality art style where the pixels are visible, it has the graphics for what should not be one of the top mmos in this age. **My qualms with the graphics are personal opinions and distaste, and if you enjoy the chibi and pixelated art style, then all power to you.

But there are massive caveats to it and Im sure alot of reviewers will mention them. I'm not technical enough to give you all the pros and cons, but Ill mention two things I personally want you to keep in mind starting in. \n\nGrind and Classes:\nStarting out is really boring but once you start getting power everything just sorta snowballs and momentum feels like it doesn't stop once you understand enough and set goals. It's a grind fest, and it does scratch that grind itch some select players like me get alot. I like grindy games, and I know it's not for everyone.  Lots of classes, lots of variety and skill expression levels on each, sadly performance of each sadly fluctuates widely between one another. (Pet peeve: I wish we had a bit more customization on our keybinds since alot of buttons can't be changed.)\n\nCommunity:\nYou will notice on ingame chats that alot of people dislike Nexon. The reasoning varies: a lot of people mention how the Korean version has it better when it comes to event and progression, or how the story and content are changing and retconning sometimes with questionable results. These didn't affect me as heavily as others since, again, I am new. Don't misunderstand me here, I get it, the more I learn of how things where, and how things should had been just makes me think \"this game I'm playing right now could had been better\". Interestingly, I actually had 0 toxic interactions so far, kinda crazy for an MMO 500+ hours in.\n\nWould I recommend this game to you? No. While I personally like it, maybe you won't. You have to go and look at a youtube video or 2 and see what's it like. If what you see interest you, hop in and try it. \n\nThis is not an easy game to recommend, but if you're like me, and like grindy games, then you'll find this very addictive (for better or worse? up to you.)\n\nI'll enjoy this while it last.", "timestamp_created": 1736993953, "timestamp_updated": 1736994522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185682259": {"recommendationid": "185682259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086039263", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 283178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7996, "playtime_at_review": 281725, "last_played": 1737400911}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Nahhh, not worth it, absolutely trash.", "timestamp_created": 1736990729, "timestamp_updated": 1736990729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185654516": {"recommendationid": "185654516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353492462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 103161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5015, "playtime_at_review": 101224, "last_played": 1737315520}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Solo le falta traduccion nada mas", "timestamp_created": 1736958271, "timestamp_updated": 1736958271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185647730": {"recommendationid": "185647730", "author": {"steamid": "76561199138673697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2739, "playtime_at_review": 2648, "last_played": 1737339925}, "language": "english", "review": "Long time mapler here.
