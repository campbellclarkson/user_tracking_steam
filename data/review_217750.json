And while I don't typically leave reviews on games, this one has absolutely touched my heart. It is truly a shame as of 2025 that it appears to be abandoned by its developers. But its fanbase is loyal and keeps the PvE server alive with daily dungeons and raids. At times, the perilous world of Age of Conan feels extremely alive.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon Age of Conan: Unchained while watching youtube one day, and figured I'd give it a try. I found the story in Tortage to actually be extremely compelling. It is wonderfully voice acted, and every NPC has a memorable personality that stays with you throughout your journey. AoC has what a lot of modern mmorpgs lack: love. It is so incredibly rewarding that day you finally hit level 40 and can get a mount, only to realize you can't afford to buy one. Or you finish your first unchained dungeon after dying 15 times. Or teaming up with other players to fight the monthly world boss, getting that reward chest and opening it only to see you've got the same pair of boots for the 5th time.\r\n\r\nAnd while some players have been playing the game for over a decade, it is still very solo friendly and new player friendly. Veteran players are always willing to help newer ones and the community is full of very sweet people. Just...\r\n\r\nDon't expect to do any low level dungeons! Ever.\r\n\r\nLOL. If you're looking for an awesome game that you can play both casually and competitively, this is a great choice. And if you played all those years ago and were thinking about returning, that would be a great choice too. Give this old relic a whirl.
