A cooperative multiplayer mode is available, as are a couple of free DLCS.\r\n\r\nYou're playing a small village in a postapocalyptic fantasy world, at first simply trying to survive, and the victory conditions only get revealed to you over time. With it's storytelling (masterfully voiced by a narrator - who does all the voice acting in the game), as well as gorgeous art and music, the game masterfully evokes a dark and melancholy fantasy atmosphere - there are many events to explore - while there were many repeats, I found something new in every one of my playthroughs. While you'll get more powerful with time, you'll remain limited to the one village plus temporary camps, and nighttime always feels dangerous, as it limits your vision and makes wandering monsters much more aggressive. The game also gets points for offering several ways to resolve practically all quests and events, including many non-violent ones (though if you get attacked by wandering monsters, you'll have to fight to defend yourself). None of the races/species inhabiting the world of Thea are simple \"monsters\" - with the right choices, you can befriend Orcs, Goblins, and even some animals and mythical creatures. Another cool feature is that your experience points are applied collectively to all your villagers, so no worrying about someone lagging behind and becoming useless.\r\n\r\nLuck plays a fairly important role and there is some jankiness - for example, in my first game the Herbalist's Hut appeared all the way across a lake (there is no way to move across water), meaning that half of my village just died when my well got poisoned in a random event, as they couldn't make it to the Herbalist on time. In another game I got a very powerful villager with amazing equipment early in the game, making most encounters a cakewalk.  There are also some balance issues regarding the crafting mechanic. In other words, it's obvious that Thea was the dev team's first major project.\r\n\r\nOverall, however, it was a highly enjoyable experience, and kept me playing it almost as long as I did the old strategy classics such as Civilization.", "timestamp_created": 1735413740, "timestamp_updated": 1735413740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183895196": {"recommendationid": "183895196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198977141366", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 3037, "last_played": 1736699395}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1735319062, "timestamp_updated": 1735319062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183605580": {"recommendationid": "183605580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340109935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2225, "last_played": 1735009095}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself if addictive but they've made it impossible to progress.

You are controlling people in a village. Each person has a class, and tons of stats. The stats inform a multitude of different skills like stealth, speaking, distraction, strength, etc.\r\n\r\nEach of these characters are going to be leveling, equipping gear, and taking part in challenges. Combat is a challenge, talking is a challenge, and pretty much anything you do is a challenge. Each challenge uses various stats, and your choices in the game will dictate how you approach a situation. So if you want to take a more tactical approach to fighting enemies you go into a tactics challenge, which uses tactic related stats. \r\n\r\nNo matter the type of challenge, you enter into a card game to overcome it. The cards are your characters, and the stats on the cards are related to the stats they have related to that challenge. \r\n\r\nVery cool, but tedious after a while. It didn't take long before I just started auto resolving, because it isn't interesting enough to want to play it. \r\n\r\nYou also have a village where you can leave some of your people. You'll need some characters there to craft and gather and do other things. Unfortunately its mostly uninteresting and useless. I kept waiting for the part of the game where the researching and crafting would really pay off. It kind of could in the end of the game, but if I didn't bother it would have went just as smoothly since all the loot I got was more than enough. \r\n\r\nI started a new game with a new deity to see if the game was drastically different.
