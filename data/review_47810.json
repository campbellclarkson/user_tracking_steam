Ogni scelta ti fa venir voglia di tornare indietro e vedere altre strade, altre opzioni.

While its ambition and depth are commendable, the experience is marred by dated mechanics, uneven pacing, and technical issues that detract from its appeal.\n\nThe game\u2019s strongest aspect is its world-building. Ferelden is a rich, detailed setting filled with political intrigue, complex factions, and deep lore. However, the story, while epic in scope, is fairly generic and relies heavily on well-worn fantasy tropes. The \"chosen hero saves the world from an ancient evil\" plotline feels predictable, and the game's attempts at moral ambiguity often boil down to black-and-white decisions with obvious consequences.\n\nThe companions, a hallmark of the BioWare formula, are hit or miss. While characters like Morrigan and Alistair are memorable and well-written, others feel underdeveloped or lack meaningful arcs. Companion relationships are heavily tied to gift-giving mechanics, which feel more like a grind than genuine character development.\n\nGameplay is where Dragon Age: Origins shows its age the most. The combat system, while strategic, feels slow and repetitive. The AI is frustrating to manage, and the tactics system, while robust, requires constant micromanagement to prevent your party from making boneheaded decisions. Battles quickly devolve into spamming abilities and hoping your healer doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed, which becomes tedious over time.\n\nThe visuals are another glaring issue. Even for a game from 2009, the graphics feel dated, with stiff animations, awkward facial expressions, and bland textures. The Ultimate Edition includes all the DLC, but this only adds more uneven content to an already bloated experience. Some DLCs, like Awakening, are worthwhile, but others feel like filler that doesn\u2019t justify their inclusion.\n\nThe pacing of the game is also a problem. The main story is lengthy, but much of that time is padded with repetitive side quests, endless backtracking, and large, empty areas that feel like a chore to navigate. Dungeons, in particular, are overly long and lack variety, making exploration feel more like a slog than an adventure.\n\nTechnically, the game has its fair share of issues. On modern systems, Dragon Age: Origins can be prone to crashes, performance problems, and compatibility issues. The controls and UI are clunky, especially for PC players, and feel poorly optimized for mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhile Dragon Age: Origins was groundbreaking in its time, the Ultimate Edition doesn\u2019t do enough to address the game\u2019s shortcomings or bring it up to modern standards. It\u2019s a game that may still appeal to nostalgic fans or those willing to overlook its flaws, but for new players, it\u2019s a tough sell in a world where more polished and engaging RPGs exist.", "timestamp_created": 1736969551, "timestamp_updated": 1736969551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504549562931060791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185664363": {"recommendationid": "185664363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100632025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 2100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 2100, "last_played": 1736967309}, "language": "english", "review": "Its just a completely broken game that most likely will not even load up to the main menu, games like these should just be removed off steam.", "timestamp_created": 1736968437, "timestamp_updated": 1736968437, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185664250": {"recommendationid": "185664250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199402653415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1736971831}, "language": "english", "review": "It a great game, i love the story and the combat but game crashes all the time, if you can ignore that its an amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1736968317, "timestamp_updated": 1736968317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185660415": {"recommendationid": "185660415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953757714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 5050, "last_played": 1737146045}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute masterpiece.

Having had the opportunity to play this game in the year of its release - 2009, I immediately knew that it would be an interesting world that would draw me in. I spent a lot of hours playing the game - not only to unlock all the achievements, but also to experience all the elements of the game. I played over 500 hours on Origin and another 170 hours on Steam. Although it is possible to complete the game with the best possible result by choosing the right options, I tried every combination, often deciding on actions that I did not necessarily like.\r\n\r\nThe world of Dragon Age has everything a fantasy fan needs - humans, elves, dwarves and the mysterious gray giants - the Qunari. Additionally, you can play as a mage, a warrior and a rogue, wandering the city alleys, and wilderness. The story revolves around our hero, one of the last Gray Wardens of Ferelden, and the mysterious Blight - a terrible event that causes filthy creatures called darkspawns to set out from the underground (Deep Roads) to conquer the surface world. They are encouraged to do so by a powerful archdemon - a corrupted dragon, ready to raze the entire world to the ground. In addition to the intrigue of a mysterious Blight, we also deal with religious conflicts, slavery and racism occurring in the fantasy world. Humans hate elves. Dwarves hate elves. Elves are pushed to the margins of society. However, the game allows you to play as a representative of any race, providing an immersive jump into the story.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my favorite race, dwarves, cannot be mages, which is explained in the game's plot.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the base story campaign, DAO also offers a large story expansion and DLC adding additional, smaller campaigns. During the game, you can visit ancient ruins, wild woods and forests, go deep underground and wander through the streets of bustling cities. You will face many different opponents - including the titular, legendary dragons.\r\n\r\nDragon Age: Origins is a single-player game. However, it allows you to join several companions to support you during your travels. Among them there are four who would like to become more than just companions, coleagues or good friends - Alistair, Leliana, Morrigan and Zevran, because we are talking about them, can become romantic partners of your Gray Warden. Interactions with companions, their involvement in the world around them, the ability to give them gifts and the overall of their character add charm to the gameplay.\r\nIf someone is a fan of cRPG games, they will definitely find many hours of great, addictive and interesting gameplay here.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- immersive, dark fantasy world\r\n- bunch of really neatly written companions\r\n- romances for everyone\r\n- great soundtrack, adding to the dark vibe of the game\r\n- rich lore\r\n- hours and hours of content\r\n- your choices matter(!)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- clunky mechanics and combat gameplay\r\n- old graphics\r\n- outdated, socially incorrect content in some places (game, studio behind it and the franchise evolved over the years)\r\n\r\nFinal rating: 9.7/10", "timestamp_created": 1736711327, "timestamp_updated": 1736711327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185462929": {"recommendationid": "185462929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045625222", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 216, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1736710429}, "language": "english", "review": "Was a great game back in the day.

Infatti come molti sapranno, queste trilogie variano a seconda delle tue scelte nei precedenti giochi, avendo (nei limiti delle capacit\u00e0 umane ovvio) una run differente ogni volta. Ora concentriamoci solo su Dragon Age Origins: con le mie 35 ore di gioco (che aumenteranno perch\u00e9 la voglia di fare altre run \u00e8 tanta), posso dire tranquillamente che questo \u00e8 uno dei migliori GDR della storia, grazie alla sua scrittura, al suo gameplay e al fatto che ogni azione porta ad una conseguenza intuibile (che significa semplicemente che le risposte che date non sono criptiche, capite quali sono le opzioni) e spesso drastica. E' un gioco invecchiato sia chiaro, e a differenza dei seguiti \u00e8 anche estremamente anonimo dal punto di vista artistico, ma \u00e8 tutto un canovaccio utilizzato per spalare litri di sangue su questa tela, raccontando una storia violenta, cupa che per me rappresenta al meglio il genere del Dark Fantasy nella maniera pi\u00f9 classica del termine. Inoltre \u00e8 secondo me un ottimo entry level del CRPG, essendo che non ha meccaniche di roleplay troppo approfondite e i parametri si legano esclusivamente ai Perk di combattimento, non ad abilit\u00e0 legate a statistiche per il dialogo o altro, pur essendo presenti. Ovviamente, in particolare la versione pc, ha qualche problema di ottimizzazione con cali di frame e crash, inoltre l'IA dei nemici spesso \u00e8... diciamo eccentrica e ti porta a elaborare strategie per farli inpazzire pi\u00f9 che sconfiggerli e basta. Le campagne extra sono molto carine, alcune servono ad approfondire personaggi secondari, mentre altre (come quella di Morrigan e soprattutto l'espansione vera e propria The Awakening) sono estremamente importanti a tessere una narrativa talmente ben fatta da mettere in secondo piano un problema creativo che a me ha fatto particolarmente storcere il naso, ossia la semplicit\u00e0 artistica del mondo (inteso proprio come design delle strutture e mostri, la lore al contrario \u00e8 eccellente).  Spendendo poi due parole proprio per The Awakening ossia l'espansione, ha un pregio che non pensavo avrei percepito essendo che dlc di questo tipo si concentrano pi\u00f9 sulla trama... \u00e8 divertentissimo! Usare un personaggio estremamente avanzato, e renderlo ancora pi\u00f9 avanzato porta a creare build folli e uniche, partendo da una nuova base o da quella del gioco base. E poi non mi abituer\u00f2 mai a vedere i personaggi che ho imparato ad amare o odiare essere presenti o assenti a seconda delle mie scelte, gioco a D&D cartaceo da anni e vederlo digitale fa un effetto incredibile.\nInsomma se pensavate di buttarvi nel mondo dei Forgotten Realms con Baldur's Gate 3 ma avete sempre avuto paura che fosse troppo complesso... avete ragione, andate prima dal suo babbo e giocatevi Dragon Age Origins.", "timestamp_created": 1736258736, "timestamp_updated": 1736258736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185011381": {"recommendationid": "185011381", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992601436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 10517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3594, "playtime_at_review": 7314, "last_played": 1737314836}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly an astonishingly amusing and well written RPG experience!

claro, si lo veis rebajado (a mi me lo regalaron como a 5 euros) comprarlo. Es un RPG cl\u00e1sico, con mec\u00e1nicas simples, una historia muy buena, madura y que trata toques oscuros (cosa que pocos se atreven hoy en d\u00eda). Gr\u00e1ficos antig\u00fcillos (2009), aunque con mods se pueden arreglar un poco. No requiere de un PC potente. Y en materia de dificultad, es relativamente f\u00e1cil, aunque bastante estrat\u00e9gico y que exige atenci\u00f3n por parte del jugador en las dificultades mas altas (si vais a jugar como mago, cuidado con el fuego amigo).

These intros are a couple hours long and have implications that lead all the way to the end of the game. This was very interesting as you are giving special treatment for being a noble or and elf here or a dwarf there.\nThe gameplay is purely mouse and keyboard driven but I was able to comfortably play the entire game on my steam deck (even though the game is marked as incompatible on steam deck). You are primarily reliant on the trackpads and your own ability to adjust the settings to suits your comforts. The default controls leave a bit to be desired and I was able to remap and set the keyboard controls so that I played the game like a 3rd person action game until I got into combat where I was able to quickly switch to a top down perspective with a mode switch. This sort of playability is dependent on how well you understand steam input and if you are not comfortable experimenting then this game may be too difficult to play on the steam deck.\nHowever, on PC with a mouse abd keyboard,the game is extremely intuitive and plays just fine.\nThe world building in this game is top notch and it was a treat to learn the many details of the people, religions, and traditions in the world of Dragon Age. \nI liked how you had alot of free choice you never really feel like you are either making good or evil choices, like in alot of bioware games. You have no real alignment beyond a general reputation so you are free to treat one group or people badly for your own benefit and treat another kindly without some sort of alignment score being affected in a way you don't want. This decoupling of player statistics and abilities from morality like with Kotor, Jade empire and Mass effect makes dragon age stand out as a more pure Role playing experience, which leads me to think this is probably one of the best RPGs made by the company.", "timestamp_created": 1736154858, "timestamp_updated": 1736154858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "184907769": {"recommendationid": "184907769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147940225", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1736150026}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Dragon Age Origins, but this steam port is one of the most annoyingly broken games that EA has for sale, in 14 hours of playtime, I spent probably an extra 3-4 hours just trying to fix things that where supposedly \"included\" in the game.\nIf you don't download a patch that makes the game available to use 4 gb of vram, then you literally will not get past the bridge in Ostagar. \nWant to enjoy the dlc that the game is advertised as being sold included, you need to go manually download them all yourself. get in game only too realize that the dlc you downloaded still aren't working, and learn that its a common issue that the manual downloads EA provides are missing files that you then need to also download to make the dlc even function.\nI cannot recommend this port, its broken as it is right now, unless you're willing to put in work to fix it yourself, in which case you'll have yourself a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1736151103, "timestamp_updated": 1736151103, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184901437": {"recommendationid": "184901437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134199682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1736899918}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not buy this on Steam, it constantly crashes and then said I have an unsupported graphics card (for a 25 year old game).

It's pretty easy to find online, and as soon as I did that, all of my problems stopped, so just be aware of that!", "timestamp_created": 1736119552, "timestamp_updated": 1736119655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184879896": {"recommendationid": "184879896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087276208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2453, "last_played": 1736166649}, "language": "german", "review": "bis auf die vielen abst\u00fcrze echt geiles game. grafikeinstellungen runter und viel speichern machts ertr\u00e4glich", "timestamp_created": 1736117517, "timestamp_updated": 1736117517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184876731": {"recommendationid": "184876731", "author": {"steamid": "76561199267313912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1699993137}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "love natural", "timestamp_created": 1736114741, "timestamp_updated": 1736114741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184876393": {"recommendationid": "184876393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447409725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1142, "playtime_at_review": 3606, "last_played": 1737003643}, "language": "english", "review": "the only game ive been tempted to make new playthrus to romance every character what a game", "timestamp_created": 1736114458, "timestamp_updated": 1736114458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184874953": {"recommendationid": "184874953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198827614856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 3277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3277, "last_played": 1736103577}, "language": "russian", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1736113356, "timestamp_updated": 1736113356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184872350": {"recommendationid": "184872350", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105807035", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1655849260}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a bug that crashed my game and corrupted my savefile about 6h into the game\r\nso I started another run, same problem again.\r\nBut this time I made a backup \r\nturns out that didn't matter since it happened again\r\n\r\nso yeah maybe you are lucky and don't have any problem, I wasn't", "timestamp_created": 1736111255, "timestamp_updated": 1736111255, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184869463": {"recommendationid": "184869463", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090938838", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1892, "last_played": 1736194072}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430,  \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439", "timestamp_created": 1736109741, "timestamp_updated": 1736109741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184865976": {"recommendationid": "184865976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379502796", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1799, "last_played": 1735757810}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

There are some minor graphical glitches that could mostly be AVOIDED by tinkering with the settings it seems! About 2 hours in i got my first crash when game was changing area.. So.. Save alot, and you wont have to do stuff all over again also some advice is DO NOT USE AUTO SAVES as this seems to be the biggest cause of crashes.. Other than these minor tweaks that has to be done, GREAT GAME. If the story was any deeper, you would drown! Love the voice actors, the enviroment and general athmosphere is lovely!

The story is incredibly rich with no plot holes. Although we can't fully choose the storyline, we can decide how our character evolves over time. The story is so emotional that we can truly feel what our character is experiencing, allowing us to connect deeply. What's even more unique is that we can carry over our character from the main story into additional stories in the DLC, making the experience richer by letting us experience the beginning, journey, ending, and aftermath in the DLC. What I love about this franchise is that we can continue the story we create in this game, which then carries over into the next game, Dragon Age 2, where we get to experience the consequences or benefits of what we did in Dragon Age: Origins.\r\nOverall, the best retro RPG!", "timestamp_created": 1736072189, "timestamp_updated": 1736072189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184812829": {"recommendationid": "184812829", "author": {"steamid": "76561199773660919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "playtime_at_review": 1162, "last_played": 1737317656}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1736060925, "timestamp_updated": 1736060925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184799476": {"recommendationid": "184799476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070462867", "num_games_owned": 1332, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1736046566}, "language": "english", "review": "banger game so far but please do not play this version. even with mod fixes, you're not safe from crashes. you'll find urself quicksaving every 5 minutes unless you wanna replay segments of the game multiple times. despite currently having 10 hours in the game, i've still barely scratched the surface with how much i've had to replay. im considering starting over on xbox where combat looks worse to play just so i dont have to deal with making up lost progress anymore. its a shame that people getting into the franchise with veilgaurd don't have a stable way of playing the game on pc.", "timestamp_created": 1736046790, "timestamp_updated": 1736046790, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539295375347137451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184783322": {"recommendationid": "184783322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040064044", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1736031216}, "language": "polish", "review": "straszny ch\u0142am z okropnymi mechanikami", "timestamp_created": 1736031278, "timestamp_updated": 1736031278, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436507940292358398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184782839": {"recommendationid": "184782839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025894821", "num_games_owned": 1359, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1736029752}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "\u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456\u0439\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\u0445. \u0416\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0456 \u0444\u0456\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0447\u0438 \u0433\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438. \u041e\u0439, \u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0456\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0436 \u0436\u0430\u0434\u044e\u0433\u0438 \u0437 \u0415\u0410 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440, \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0434\u0456 \u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0454\u043c\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1736030868, "timestamp_updated": 1736030868, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184780289": {"recommendationid": "184780289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073101412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1630, "last_played": 1736071676}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful writing, fleshed out characters, interesting plot.

It is a dark western fantasy RPG with a wealth of dialogue options that satisfy the need for diverse role-playing experiences. There is also a [b][u]great degree of freedom of choice, respecting player decisions and allowing players to significantly impact the outcomes of major events in the story.[/u][/b] In many cases, players are put into moral dilemmas and the players just cannot achieve a perfect solution no matter what. Players are forced to cope with the less adverse outcome. There are also [b][u]multiple backgrounds available to start a character. Each of them would experience a very different prologue.[/u][/b] And they have slightly different interactions in the later parts of the game. In terms of role-playing diversity, this game is a classic Bioware masterpiece.\n\n[h1]Behind the Times[/h1]\n\nUnfortunately, this game has a lot of flaws due to it being more than a decade old.\n\n[h3]Poor support and maintenance[/h3] \n\nIn order to play this game on a modern PC, players are required to [b][u]install community-made unofficial patches.[/u][/b] This is quite jarring, considering BioWare is such a big company and seems too lazy to provide basic support for one of their most adored titles.

As making unique encounters eats up a ton of resources, developers have no choice but to create tedious filler fights reluctantly. I understand their difficulties, considering the limited resources available per project. However, Dragon Age Origin [b][u]includes swarms after swarms of filler encounters to an insane level.[/u][/b] It is torture getting through hordes of Darkspwans even on autopilot. The level of repetitiveness is unacceptable, even considering it is a game released back in 2008.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\n\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about this game.

A tricky game to review, as there\u2019s Origins the 2009 game, the well-executed, magnificent world that has made an entire group of people misunderstand what dark fantasy is; and Origins the 2024 game, a frustrating RPG, with a bad gameplay experience and story elements that have not aged well. Both these games coexist, but when this game gets recommended, often it is the 09 version, and often, you shall experience the 2024 version as a new player. \r\nDo I recommend this game? Only if you\u2019re already a DA fan. Unfortunately, the gameplay isn\u2019t clunky like ME1, it is simply poor. The story had to be brilliant to overcome this, that it isn\u2019t. While good, DAO leans too hard into edginess to make its grim world, rather than treating it with the tact it deserves.  6/10.\r\nGameplay:\r\nI despise when people reviewing something claim it\u2019s objectively bad, but for Origins I shall make this exception: It\u2019s objectively bad.\r\nFor a CRPG, there\u2019s very little unique tactics one will use. Contrasting this to DOS2, where constantly using the environment to your advantage, and whose many abilities have a counter is where you\u2019ll find the biggest shortcomings. Most of the more powerful abilities lack or have a highly specific counter: hexes lack a remove curse; AoE attacks such as fireball give knock down, burning and hit a huge area, making escape near impossible if the attacked was launched; abilities that strike multiple characters such as scattershot and chain lightning have a very lenient line of sight to hit your party to name a few. It\u2019s like playing chess with all pawns as queens, whoever is playing white, launches the attack and wins. This isn\u2019t saying that OP abilities don\u2019t exist in other games, but that the gameplay doesn\u2019t revolve around them.\r\nMission design is bad. Not a matter for debate, this game 6th most endorsed mod is skip the fade, a mod that deletes an entire section of a quest in this game.\r\nMost games with dedicated quests will have their quests clock in 1-2 hours at most and break down them in multiple entries if longer than that. DAO will have plenty clocking at 3 hours, meaning you\u2019ll often stop in the middle of a quest.  The story, aka the interesting part, is focused at the start and end, with a boring middle where you\u2019re stuck with the gameplay. This is not to say that all quests are bad, Ostigar or the Landsmeet are great, but that many quests, especially in act 2, are held back by their structure rather than their narrative.\r\nIn the end, Origins is a game where you put up with the playing it. \r\nVisuals:\r\nOnce more, objectively poor. The graphics belong in 2005, not in 2009 when this game was released. This is, however, the easiest part to look away from, but the visual identity is not. \r\nThis is whiplash, I\u2019m reviewing while revisiting the entire series, but Veilguard\u2019s art direction exposes how uncreative origins is. A simple thing such as the pallet of the corrupted city being toned out from the rest of the game goes a long way. The big moment of horror from this game, the Broodmother, is just Jabba the hut but woman, desire demons are simply a naked woman... You can do a lot more with the limited graphical resources. Look at DA2 Kirkwall\u2019s few different regions have a unique feel, while one would be hard pressed to distinguish between the alienage, a ghetto, from the market of Denerim. \r\nNarrative: \r\nSo why would you play this game? After all I have been only bashing it for a while. One word, the world.\r\nThedas makes the galaxy in ME feel tame, and I don\u2019t say this lightly. This feels like a world in which people live, magic is a political issue which nations diverge on, the chant is one of the few true religions in fantasy etc. The game borrows elements of the real world and twists them, e.g Andraste is Jesus, but a woman who was burned at the stake, thus the clergy is entirely built by women and the dead are cremated. These little things make the world feel alive. While plenty will be exposed through conversation, some will be done exclusively through codex entries, the entire elven pantheon for example relies on those. \r\nPlot wise, it is sufficient. It will not set the world on fire, but you\u2019re a member of the only order who can stop the threat, thus you go gathering allies to face such a threat. Simple, but effective. \r\nThe characters are rough diamonds, interesting with few exceptions, but arguably sticking too close to the DnD alignment chart assigned. Morrigan is the best example, as both the best character in this game, with this ruthless survival first mentality, yet she\u2019ll trust the magister slaver in the alienage will keep his end of the bargain as she must be the \u201cneutral evil\u201d character, rather than pragmatic.  \r\nThe PC, the warden, is the only silent protagonist of the series, which means great freedom in choice but surprisingly less reactivity than I remembered. The evil path is funny, but it is no dark urge with its own dramatic arc. As for the smaller elements, such as your race, DAO loud moments, such as the prologue or meeting again your faction, but at times simply they don\u2019t make a difference, being a dalish elf in the allienage. The best example comes at the end of the Landsmeet, where you cannot become Alistair\u2019s or Annora\u2019s consort if you\u2019re an elf, after all you\u2019re a seen as a lesser people by many, yet you\u2019ll choose the ruler of Ferelden. The game at the same time is following and ignoring its own lore, and something that surely would be criticized had it happened in other entries. \r\nThe biggest shortcoming of Origins is its edginess, very much akin of a teen who wishes to show there are now an adult. For instance, Sten will just admit to murdering an entire family of farmers and mechanically the game is asking you to recruit him. Subtle was not a word in the writing room, and the course correction will be swift for the next games.\r\nIt is bizarre how much this game leans into extreme violence and sexual assault; in the Dalish quest, instead of having the children of a character being killed leading to a curse, the boy must be tortured to death, while the girl must be r*ped and take her own life when she finds out to be pregnant. Just killing the children would suffice to set up the cycle of vengeance that the quest wishes to explore, the extra adds nothing. Personally, it makes the story worse, beyond feeling forced, it doesn\u2019t treat said violence with the tact to explore it in a serious manner. It\u2019s a cheap attempt at shock value and the vague concept of \u201cdarkness\u201d.\r\nFinally, the pedantic, and quite useless, discussion of if this game is dark fantasy. While it certainly borrows elements of such, it has always been a high fantasy narrative. Having elements such as slavery, racism or extreme violence doesn\u2019t make a narrative dark fantasy, horror does. The main horror element is the blight and its corruption, which is not the centre of the narrative, present mostly in the start and act 3. One barely gets to see the effect of the blight in the world. We don\u2019t get, for example, to choose which city to help from its wrath. Denerim at the end, doesn\u2019t seem unique, and looks like a town sacked by any army, not corrupted by the blight. The game is about uniting the forces to fight it, and quelling the infighting, and how far are you willing to go, it is closer to ME3, a classic hero\u2019s journey. \r\nSo no, I don\u2019t believe DAO is dark fantasy. Imo it was a marketing stick that because of the severe course correction this franchise has made, became truth to distinguish it from the other three games. \r\nIn summary, DAO\u2019s narrative is good if you can look past the edgier elements, that have aged poorly, but is one overrated.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735597727, "timestamp_updated": 1735597727, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446224242448806763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184256755": {"recommendationid": "184256755", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224360491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2530, "playtime_at_review": 4417, "last_played": 1737405160}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very very good.

The only other thing I disliked about the game was the absolute horror and shock on my face when I had to go back like 4 hours to redo one conversation with Alistair because I didn't 'harden' him as I should have if I wanted the ending that I wanted, if you are planning on romancing Alistair, spare yourself and google how to harden him when you get to denerim!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1735572368, "timestamp_updated": 1735572368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184222065": {"recommendationid": "184222065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976223732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3097, "last_played": 1735826102}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Se ha mantenido bastante bien con los a\u00f1os a pesar del tiempo que tiene el juego", "timestamp_created": 1735568088, "timestamp_updated": 1735568088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184220763": {"recommendationid": "184220763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066393311", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1752, "last_played": 1387921916}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the best Dragon Age game ever released.\n\nPlay this then play nothing after it. \n\nThis game works fine as a perfectly self contained journey all the other games are like fanfic that retcons stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1735567134, "timestamp_updated": 1735567134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184220699": {"recommendationid": "184220699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284526115", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 231, "playtime_at_review": 1301, "last_played": 1736282951}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0432\u0456. \u0426\u0435 \u0436 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430)", "timestamp_created": 1735567084, "timestamp_updated": 1735567084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547444820404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184181953": {"recommendationid": "184181953", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056972108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1735528909}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente enredo, tem uma jogabilidade que eu n\u00e3o estou t\u00e3o acostumado, \u00e9 um pouco dificil, bons gr\u00e1ficos e amei a personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, e como de fato a gente influencia a hist\u00f3ria", "timestamp_created": 1735529038, "timestamp_updated": 1735529038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184178301": {"recommendationid": "184178301", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027975253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 880, "playtime_at_review": 2754, "last_played": 1736499069}, "language": "english", "review": "Peak game!

It's level design offers just enough to give you a sense of adventure without huge empty areas to artificially pad playtime like in most recent RPG's. This allows for a more balanced pacing between experiencing the game's story and exploration. The world itself is oozing with atmosphere. From Ostagar to The circle of Magi and from Denerim to the Deep Roads, every place in this game is designed to be unique, beautiful, and interesting. (I admit that the Fade and the deeproads sections, as gorgeous as they are, can be tiresome after the first play-though...so there's that.)\n\nSTORY\nThe over-arching story is simple and not that open ended. BUT! There are so many fun role-playing decisions from as early as the character creation menu up until the end of the story. This ensures that each play-through is different and nuanced offering tons of replay value. You may always be the hero of Ferelden by the end. Question is, what kind of hero will you be? Will you be a saint, a kind hero who tries help to everyone? Or will you be a an malicious person who hurts others but happens to defeat a great threat and therefore save the day, a hero in name only? Your actions throughout the game will decide. \n\nCOMPANIONS:\nProbably one of the most memorable and my fav group of companions in all of DA (even Bioware) games. Maybe even my fav companions in all of gaming. They're fun to engage with and have depth. They feel like real people thanks to the phenomenal voice work and competent writing. The banter system is peak too. Also, there is a believable reason why my PC is suddenly the leader of the group established early on.\n\nCOMBAT:\nCombat may be janky, outdated even, but the party tactics, an improvement from Baldur's gate before it imho, is engaging to play with. The implementaion of this mechanic is among the things that really sets DAO apart from the other DA games for me. In DA2 I never needed it and it was so janky and barely even there in DAI that I just gave up on using it.", "timestamp_created": 1735410747, "timestamp_updated": 1735410747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282048225402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184008590": {"recommendationid": "184008590", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037823858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1012, "last_played": 1735762051}, "language": "english", "review": "new obsession", "timestamp_created": 1735406493, "timestamp_updated": 1735406493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184005928": {"recommendationid": "184005928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074737771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1735333274}, "language": "english", "review": "Peak", "timestamp_created": 1735404853, "timestamp_updated": 1735404853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184003388": {"recommendationid": "184003388", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991234625", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 5953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1749, "playtime_at_review": 1002, "last_played": 1736439700}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juegos de rol de todos los tiempos, precursor del estilo de juego que ha desembocado en Baldur's Gate 3, que debe mucho a \u00e9ste.

At the very peak of my arrogance, I turned my back when people talked about this game. Such was my ignorance that I almost ended up committing an irreversible act: ignoring this jewel. Now that I've made it clear how much I enjoyed the game, let's dive into a detailed analysis (at least as far as the steam characters limit allow me to go!).\n\nGameplay: Dragon Age: Origins features a mix of real-time combat and turn-based elements via the pause system, which could have been a major strength but isn't fully realized. On difficulties above normal (hard or nightmare), it's nearly impossible to overcome challenges without exploiting the pause feature to manage your party and resources meticulously. Players must closely monitor each party member's actions, health, and enemies, making battles highly demanding in terms of micromanagement.\nThe game's tactics system for party members, designed to automate certain behaviors in specific situations, is flawed. Many tactical options don't work as intended or are impractical for more challenging encounters. For instance, commands like \"use potion when health is below X%\" can be ineffective due to resource scarcity, especially in higher difficulties. Additionally, commands for combat actions often have unexplained cooldowns, causing party members to act unpredictably.\nClass gameplay varies significantly. Playing as a warrior with a two-handed sword, for example, requires careful planning early on but isn't inherently difficult once you understand the mechanics. However, certain encounters, especially against mages, can be frustrating due to the imbalance in combat dynamics. The dual weapon system, while theoretically adding depth, is impractical due to limited level cap and stat distribution, making it essential to specialize in one weapon type.\nBalancing issues are pervasive. While the early game can be punishingly difficult, requiring precise knowledge of the game's mechanics and meta strategies, later stages can make the player feel overwhelmingly powerful. This inconsistency detracts from the overall experience, making some parts of the game feel artificially difficult while others are too easy.\n\nStory - I can't praise this enough. The story of Dragon Age: Origins is simply one of the best when it comes to western RPGs. The quality is so high that you occasionally wonder if this is really a game or not. Characters are ridiculously well written, from the most random NPC to the most important story characters; even with the technical limitations of the time, many scenarios manage to convey a LOT of the history of this vast continent; much of the codex material, the texts that tell a bit about the world's lore, quests, characters, and so on during the game, are of extremely high quality, something I rarely find in games like this one. In summary, you genuinely feel like you're living in that world and your choices truly matter. Everything you do, no matter how simple it may seems to be, ends up altering the overall course of events in some way. I really didn't expect such freedom in such an old game! That said, I'd like to make it clear that even though all the game's text is of the highest quality, there are still some... problems. The most relevant here would be the number of dialogue lines party members have at their respective affection levels. I personally exhausted most of Alistair's dialogues early in the game. This meant that the only texts I had with him later were his reactions to some main story events. It's worth noting, however, that the individual number of dialogue lines for each party member is by no means objectively small. The problem lies in the distribution of these dialogues not being done that well, leaving the player with little to see from the character after 10-15 hours of gameplay. The characters also interact with each other during your adventures, and it's ridiculously fun to see they acting so naturally. Watching Morrigan pick on Alistair or Sten getting the upper hand in every argument with her is so simple yet magical.\n\nSound - The game's voice acting is phenomenal. Almost every character in it has a voice, except our protagonist, who produces grunts (and says a few words during fights). You can feel the emotion behind every single line coming from every single character. The nuances of their personalities, their specificities, etc., is also 'transmuted' through their voices. It's truly one of the best voice-acting performances I've ever seen in a game! The soundtrack, on the other hand, is VERY good at some moments but ends up being 'okay' at others. Don't get me wrong, every piece of music in dragon age origins is amazing and worthy of applause; the problem is that enclosed segments in long dungeons make certain tracks in particular become saturated. Overall, I have no complaints other than that, so I'd say the score is 9/10. It's not as good as the soundtrack of games like Elden Ring or The Witcher 3, but it doesn't fall behind any other game out there. Below a 10, but above all the 8s haha.\n\nPerformance - This is a point I rarely touch on, but here it is necessary. If you intend to play dragon age origins now in 2024, it's important to be aware of the need for mods. The game itself has several bugs withing the PC version that can completely break your run. Your save is at such a high risk of getting soft-locked at so many different points in the main game without those mods that it's impossible to recommend playing without them. Another important point to highlight is the crashing. While most of the base game's significant bugs and its expansions are easily fixed with those incredible mods available, the same can't be said for the crashing. In my experience, I can count on one hand the number of times I could play for more than an hour without a single crash. At certain moments, the game would crash every 10-15 minutes, which can be incredibly frustrating. It got so bad that I developed the incredible habit of saving ALL THE TIME, knowing that at any moment I could lose my progress. You might be thinking it was a compatibility issue with the mods I installed, but I'm afraid that's not the case. Each of the most popular mods that fix the bugs is compatible with each other, so there's no compatibility issue with them. If you have doubts about which to install, there's a guide on Steam with a list of mods that fix the game's and its expansions' significant bugs and soft locks and are compatible with each other.\n\nConclusion - If you played Skyrim and liked the empty text present in it, which was a step back even from its predecessor Oblivion, I strongly recommend sitting down and enjoying the dragon age origins experience. The text is deep, the world is alive, the characters DO exist, and your choices matter. You won't read the codex within the game forcibly, but out of curiosity to learn more about this magical world. The soundtrack also holds up well and the voice acting is impeccable. I couldn't recommend this game more than i'm doing haha. It's worth noting that this only applies to dragon age origins; I'm not praising the expanded world in dragon age 2 and Inquisition. Both games are extremely weak compared to Origins in this regard and don't deserve nearly as much praise. Dragon Age 2 is still a well-above-average experience if you can endure the gameplay, but Inquisition, apart from the romances, which are probably the best in the franchise, is at best 'okay'. If you want a complete game, play Origins and be happy.\n\nAddendum - This analysis refers purely to the base game and the Witch Hunt expansion. Dragon Age: Origins Awakening, the expansion continuing Origins' story, is good but doesn't reach the level of the main game. Addressing it in this analysis would significantly reduce the overall game's level, so I've come to chose to leave my opinion on it out.", "timestamp_created": 1735244368, "timestamp_updated": 1735244368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183789043": {"recommendationid": "183789043", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982340717", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 875, "last_played": 1735243675}, "language": "english", "review": "After finally managing to defend the village this crap piece of software keeps crashing when loading the interlude.

Yeah, me too. ANYWAY! Dragon Age: Origins. Thank you to my dear friend, BobbyBurst, for gifting me Dragon Age: Veilguard because it has given me a good excuse to play the Dragon Age games again. Origins is one of my most favorite RPGs that I played a ton of on my Xbox (and my PS3 but I actually never finished the game on that system). For a game that came out in 2009, it still holds up well. The game still looks good, the story's amazing, the characters well-written and loved (not you, Loghain), and so much lore from the Codices! All of your companions that you meet along the way is one of the things that makes Origins amazing. The banters between them are just great especially the ones involving Alistair. I love that man. Such a goober. This is also the version of the game that I got to experience all the DLCs as on the Xbox, I could only play Awakening. They are good! If you want to experience what Origins has to fully offer along with the choices you make affecting the rest of the games, I recommend you play the DLCs. Except the Darkspawn one. That one is just a \"What If\" DLC so it doesn't really add much to the main story, and I skipped it. The order of the DLCs you want to play is Awakening, Golem of Amgarrak, and Witch Hunt. Awakening will be the longest DLC as it adds a bunch of new stuff like companions. Golem and Witch Hunt are pretty short as I was able to get through Golem within an hour and a half and Witch Hunt roughly around the same time. Bioware stated they would never make DLCs as long as Awakening again, and they indeed kept their word. Oh yeah, I just remembered, there is a DLC for Leliana. It's okay. I mean if you want more backstory on Leliana, I recommend you play but if you don't care, another safe to skip DLC. There is also the Soldier's Peak and Return to Ostagar DLCs. Both are also okay too and are great to do if you want the extra XPs and Gears plus some more lore and resolution of giving a certain character a proper funeral. Despite all the praise I give the game, Origins does have its issues. One of the main ones is that if you want have a good experience with the game not plagued by crashes, you need to mod this game along with doing some steps to get the DLCs to appear despite this being the Ultimate Edition. I recommend going to the \"Guides\" section of Origins and find two people, G the Glamorous and Dreams. The two guides made by these wonderful folks is what you need to get the game fully working and going. I noticed when I play Origins, the game will eventually start to stutter and drop in frames. Granted, it is probably because I play as a mage and decide to throw all my AoE spells as soon as any battle starts but anyway, the best way to fix it is to save your game and restart Origins should this issue occur and it will occur throughout your playthrough. The combat in this game is okay. It is not bad by any means but it does get repetitive by the end as once you find your favorite ability combo, you will stick with that for the rest of the game. Origins is also one of those games where I honestly just recommend playing on Easy or install a mod that stops friendly fire from happening on Normal because I do not know why friendly fire is a thing on Normal. Dragon Age 2 does it where it only happens on the hardest difficulty. In Origins, it is either Easy or install a mod for Normal as it really makes combat more annoying than it needs to be when Wynne or Morrigan or even you the player uses a spell or another ability that hurts, knocks down, freezes, etc everyone. Another reason to just stick to Easy as this game has moment where the difficulty spikes for really no reason which can take you out of the experience. Actually, the difficulty may suddenly spike even on easy. The game is weird in that aspect. Overall, Dragon Age: Origins is still a very amazing game that I recommend to anyone that enjoys RPGs and want to get into the series so they can prepare for Veilguard. I know I am!!! I am excited and dreading to play Veilguard! 9/10!!! The mod where you can bring your Mabari Doggy Pet with you even with a full party is VERY NECESSARY!!!", "timestamp_created": 1735090287, "timestamp_updated": 1735090287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514285683631896973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183610295": {"recommendationid": "183610295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159927173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1511734168}, "language": "english", "review": "This is easily the best game in the series, none of the others have compared to it.
