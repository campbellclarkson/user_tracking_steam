The map design and balancing is honestly the worst. The game developers completely rushed the entire development of the game and the map levels to the point that it became COMPLETELY unplayable. I had to replay the same maps in the campaign and it became repetitive and frustrating to the point of having to modify the SAVEDATA xml file from False to True to skip the campaign maps and continue the story.\r\n\r\nThis game doesn't even have a Cloud Save built into steam making you lose all progress in CAMPAIGN and MULTIPLAYER. They have completely botched the game development in a complete disregard to their brand. The community are the only ones keeping this game alive and multiplayer is completely dead especially in ranked. I was honestly expecting a sequel or at least a mobile version of this game would have been perfect. The game balancing needs some major rework.\r\n\r\nI have been playing RTS games for over 30 years: All of Command and Conquer, Age of Empires, Clash of Clans, etc. The pacing, spawning, warren and unit production is EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW. It takes 3 minutes to build a Warren for Tier 3 units and another 3 minutes to produce one. The match will be over before you even produce single one. These matches end in less than 7 minutes on average and 10 minutes at most. Now I know for sure these developers obviously never played their own game. The entire game development was handled poorly and had much potential but I must refuse to recommend this game to anyone. PATHETIC.\r\n\r\nThe ending was the worst confusing trash heap I have ever seen. The legit switch you from one Commander to another after defeating another Commander, to another to another and going full circle until the entire map was overrun by the pigs. The story was outright AWFUL as it progressed which the inspired by story plot of Animal Farm by George Orwell which is about a group of farm animals who rebel against their human masters and establish a society based on equality and solidarity only for the pigs to rule over them and be just as bad as their human rulers. It would have made sense if the pigs fled the continent entirely to escape and create their own promised land but the fact that all the pigs have the capacity to simultaneously conspire to overthrow all four of the current ruling factions is outright laughable. This ending is more twists than M. Night Shyamalan's yoga instructor. The story writers obviously need to learn to read so they can read to learn and only then can they write an actual story.", "timestamp_created": 1735707187, "timestamp_updated": 1735707187, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184156308": {"recommendationid": "184156308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118166307", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1561573366}, "language": "english", "review": "Rats", "timestamp_created": 1735508214, "timestamp_updated": 1735508214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184072982": {"recommendationid": "184072982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355380709", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1737016328}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really good, if very simple, strategy game.", "timestamp_created": 1735456921, "timestamp_updated": 1735456921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 3210, "total_negative": 804, "total_reviews": 4014}, "cursors": {"AoJ4nLi1uIgDcM+0kwQ=": "Mon Jan 20 17:30:15 2025"}}
