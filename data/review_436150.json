"last_played": 1734605734}, "language": "english", "review": "Here\u2019s an analysis of why Governor of Poker 3 could be considered objectively \"better\" than SOMA:\n\nBroad Accessibility:\n\nGovernor of Poker 3 offers a game mechanic (poker) that is universally understood and accessible to players across various skill levels. It\u2019s a game based on widely recognized rules and concepts, which can be easily grasped and enjoyed by most players without requiring specialized knowledge.\nSOMA, being a horror and narrative-driven game, may require a more specific interest in survival horror or a deep engagement with complex themes. As a result, its appeal may be narrower when looking at the larger population, making it less broadly accessible.\nMultiplayer Functionality:\n\nGovernor of Poker 3 has a robust multiplayer component, where players can engage with others in real-time poker games. This feature expands its functionality and makes it inherently more social and interactive, which is an objectively measurable advantage in terms of offering ongoing, real-time engagement.\nSOMA, on the other hand, is strictly a single-player experience, limiting its capacity for ongoing, social interaction, and reducing its replayability from a multiplayer perspective.\n\nReplayability:\n\nGovernor of Poker 3 features dynamic gameplay with a wide range of poker tournaments, competitions, and strategies. Players can continue to improve their skills, compete with new opponents, and explore new challenges. This makes the game more replayable over time.\nSOMA, while engaging for its story, is primarily a linear, single-player experience. Once the narrative is completed, the game's replayability is limited, as there is less incentive for players to return unless they want to experience it again or explore different paths (which in this case are fewer than in a game with multiplayer modes).\nSkill and Strategy:\n\nIn Governor of Poker 3, the game is based on poker, a skill-based card game that requires logical thinking, strategy, and decision-making. The game rewards players who develop their skills and hone their abilities over time, providing an objective metric for improvement.\nSOMA is not skill-based in the same way. It relies on story progression and puzzle-solving, which, while valuable in their own right, do not offer the same kind of measurable skill growth and competitive edge that Governor of Poker 3 offers.\n\nGlobal Popularity:\n\nPoker, as a game, has a long history and is enjoyed globally. Governor of Poker 3 capitalizes on this established interest in poker, offering a game that appeals to a wide, international audience. The game draws on existing knowledge and enthusiasm about poker, which helps expand its reach.\nSOMA, while critically acclaimed within its genre, appeals primarily to players interested in narrative-driven, horror-themed games. It doesn't have the same level of broad, global appeal.\n\nSimplicity and Low Barrier to Entry:\n\nThe rules of poker are relatively simple to understand and don't require a deep knowledge of complex mechanics. Governor of Poker 3 is easy to pick up, and players can start playing right away with minimal learning curve, making it more universally accessible.\nSOMA, by contrast, requires players to engage with a narrative-driven experience, which often involves a steeper learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with survival horror games or those who are less interested in story-heavy content.\nIn an objective, non-subjective world, these factors could lead to Governor of Poker 3 being seen as \"better\" than SOMA, simply based on its wider accessibility, broader appeal, multiplayer elements, and overall replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1737115238, "timestamp_updated": 1737115534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538463830947876", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185771525": {"recommendationid": "185771525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066783143", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3000, "playtime_at_review": 1648, "last_played": 1737311627}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever gotten quads 3 times in a day - or EVER ?
