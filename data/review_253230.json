The platforming the and tools you have are so shallow, and the hats are \"see corresponding glowy thing and press x\", except one of them is literally just the run button.\r\nThe stealth segments had me almost put the game down right there. This game already has pace issues due to being warped back to the hub after every hourglass, and the cutscenes and dialogue. Mandatory stealth slows the game to an absolute crawl. When mario 64 did it it was fast and you could hop right back in, also theres a reason mario odyssey removed that mechanic all together because its outdated.\r\nSpeaking of mario 64, that game had a great camera. This game, had arguably one of the worst cameras i had ever dealt with in a 3d platformer. It's borderline functional outside in open spaces but going into like a walljump area or indoors it breaks completely, and takes away your control of it all the time.\r\nThis game has conveyance issues. It doesn't hold your hand which is great, but things like the faucets in mafia town that have a circular arrow path around them. So i assumed i had to run in a circle on it to turn the handle. No. you have to hit it 3 times. Stuff like that is constant.\r\nAll the characters and NPC's except the snatcher are completely forgettable. Why would you give them a voice but not give them a personality or dialogue thats worth my time when i wanna hit buttons.\r\nAs a 3D platform lover I finally got to this game after 8 years of knowing about it and forgetting about it, and now I kinda wish I hadn't. The people who compare told me this game was on par with mario 64 or banjo kazooie are straight up delusional.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1737347038, "timestamp_updated": 1737347038, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015263080596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185992296": {"recommendationid": "185992296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314981730", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1641692072}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game, wish I could've gotten more out of it, but it was fun nevertheless.\nShares a lot of gameplay feeling as Super Mario", "timestamp_created": 1737345228, "timestamp_updated": 1737345228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185982901": {"recommendationid": "185982901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039467610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1282, "playtime_at_review": 1282, "last_played": 1737332206}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games that took me a while to get around to, but I'm so happy I did.

eventualmente motivado a explorar, ponto exencial do game do seu estilo, um collectathon.\n\nV\u00e1lido se ressaltar o carinho da empresa para jogos do Nintendo 64 e do seu sucessor, o gamecube, v\u00e1rios elementos dos encontrados \u00e9 claramente uma inspirados em games como \"super Mario 64\" e \"super Mario sunshine\" que ao contr\u00e1rio de ASTROBOT, (jogo mais famoso desse estilo

liberado um elemento extra, sendo eles desafios, que para um jogador mediano \u00e9 basicamente uma porta aberta para insanidade, mas que de qualquer forma \u00e9 mto divertido jogar.\n\nMinhas

menor, mas se destaca em momentos ic\u00f4nicos, como a fase do trem e a floresta subcon e personagem carism\u00e1ticos como a pr\u00f3pria hat kid, o snatcher, mustache girls a rainha Vanessa entre

\u00e9 dif\u00edcil saber de quem eu gosto mais, seja o Condutor sendo um cabe\u00e7a-quente, o Snatcher (Fantasma da Floresta Subcon) com o jeito arrogante dele, at\u00e9 as focas da DLC do cruseiro

do jogo, cada fase tem seu aspecto \u00fanico, sua atmosfera \u00fanica, sua trilha marcante, seus personagens ic\u00f4nicos e tudo isso unido \u00e9 o que faz o visual desse jogo algo \u00fanico

Sin embargo algunos niveles son algo cortos, con esto no me refiero que te los puedes pasar en segundos, sino que, en comparaci\u00f3n con otros niveles principales te los puedes pasar en 5 minutos que otros niveles.\r\n\r\nLa m\u00fasica es bastante buena, ninguna queja y es de las mejores cosas del juego.\r\n\r\nLa historia a pesar de ser una sencilla cuenta con personajes bastante carism\u00e1ticos, aunque no profundizan mucho en ellos porque recalco, la historia es sencilla debido a que no es el verdadero objetivo del juego, ya que el objetivo es la jugabilidad.\r\n\r\nY hablando de esta \u00faltima, es lo mejor de este juego, las mec\u00e1nicas de la protagonista son muy c\u00f3modas y f\u00e1ciles de aprender. Adem\u00e1s de ser muy fluida.\r\n\r\nLo secundario: Los niveles de grieta temporal son muy buenos para ser niveles bonus, (adem\u00e1s de hacer referencia a los niveles sin el A.Q.U.A.C. de Super Mario Sunshine).\r\n\r\nEl juego tiene una duraci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s corta de lo que esperaba, en 8 horas jugando de forma casual sin completar el 100% ya pude desbloquear el nivel final y completar la historia (Aunque hablar\u00e9 de algo que contrarresta m\u00e1s o menos este punto m\u00e1s adelante).\r\n\r\n\u00bfRecuerdan cuando habl\u00e9 de que el juego no profundiza mucho con sus personajes? Pues bueno, al final quieren que sientas como si ya pasaste toda la vida con ellos y te hacen sentir un poco de tristeza al final,\r\nadmito que si sent\u00ed algo cuando eso ocurre. Pero como al final no estas con dichos personajes luego de haberte pasado un mundo pues... tampoco es la gran cosa (S\u00e9 que son\u00e9 re hater con este punto pero no me malentiendan, me gustaron mucho estos personajes, es solo que me hubiera gustado que profundizaran m\u00e1s con ellos. Tampoco pido que sea algo igual a Undertale, solo un poco m\u00e1s de profundidad en ellos).\r\n\r\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, A Hat In Time es un m\u00e1s que excelente juego plataformero, corto pero entretenido, aunque si se te hizo MUY corto entonces c\u00f3mprate los DLC que a\u00f1aden mundos extra al juego, aunque por lo que vi en las rese\u00f1as de dichos contenidos, parece que no son tan buenos, no puedo opinar mucho porque no he comprado los DLC de este juego, aunque si te los vas a comprar recomiendo que lo hagas cuando est\u00e9n en oferta.\r\nSi no te interesan los DLC entonces prueba los niveles de la workshop de steam, hay bastantes de calidad por lo que vi.\r\nY si.. recomiendo comprarlo (Aunque admito que lo compr\u00e9 en oferta xd).\r\nEspero que esta rese\u00f1a te haya sido \u00fatil.", "timestamp_created": 1736110241, "timestamp_updated": 1736110241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184868384": {"recommendationid": "184868384", "author": {"steamid": "76561199471401162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 337, "playtime_at_review": 705, "last_played": 1737056696}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "eu amo esse jogo :)", "timestamp_created": 1736108945, "timestamp_updated": 1736108945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184852379": {"recommendationid": "184852379", "author": {"steamid": "76561199637933192", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2694, "playtime_at_review": 5540, "last_played": 1737047367}, "language": "english", "review": "The best 3D platform game I ever played!", "timestamp_created": 1736096601, "timestamp_updated": 1736096601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184848779": {"recommendationid": "184848779", "author": {"steamid": "76561199782194723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1736350424}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c", "timestamp_created": 1736094248, "timestamp_updated": 1736094248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184845118": {"recommendationid": "184845118", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095430820", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 672, "playtime_at_review": 1180, "last_played": 1737226712}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "muito divertido, levei susto com a bruxa da area fantasma\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736091589, "timestamp_updated": 1736091589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184817303": {"recommendationid": "184817303", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014983626", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1736302747}, "language": "english", "review": "THiS IS SO FUN", "timestamp_created": 1736066082, "timestamp_updated": 1736066082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184814385": {"recommendationid": "184814385", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076254598", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "playtime_at_review": 578, "last_played": 1737001891}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of my all-time favorites.

The worlds are fun to play in and it retains elements similar to Super Mario Odyssey. The graphics are fine, with childish animation. The characters are definitely unique in appearance, but their character backgrounds are pretty plain. \nExample :\nProtagonist turned to Antagonist.\nWeird people (birds) that hate each other but don't fully hate each other.\n(If you consider this somewhat deep then I don't mind. To each their own.)\n\nTLDR ; The game is pretty good for first timers or people who just want to chill.

Or at least I haven't played any other in a long while, but decided to get this while it was on sale.\n\nThe gameplay was very well paced imo, easy to navigate and reminiscent of the castle hub in m64. There were enough interesting ideas and concepts thrown into this game that made it enjoyable to play through. the platforming in this game felt natural to other games i played back in the day. It has a good control scheme, even though I was using a keyboard. it was still very managable and I think a controller would be perfect for the speedrunner. Revisiting areas with new items had a good flow throughout the game, only things i didnt really use was the slowtime hat and the umbrella blaster. \n\nI think the biggest bug with me was it seemed to bit too easy? of course not everything was, there were some moments, I guess if you made it too hard then everyone would compare it to something like DS. It still was a pretty relaxing experience just like those collecathon type of games way back, definitely with more variety in this game. One thing I noticed playing is that it was pretty short. It's a platform puzzle based kind of game so it wasnt gonna be a long game in itself I guess. Finished in about 18 hours and I did take my time playing and also checked every nook and cranny, all in all gameplay wise I was satisfied with what the game offers. pretty neat little story, had creativity and charm. I guess that would move this to the next section.\n\nThe graphics in this game are pretty great. not groundbreaking obviously, but it compliments the gameplay well. It's a good example on how little can go a long ways to painting the way a game looks. The colors all felt natural to the theme of it all, each chapter to their own as well. While many may think every video game needs to break graphics cards and be realistic, this game displays a colorful artstyle that reminded me of something that would be on the gamecube. colors pop! The cartoon comedic characters are neat and add more charm to the game, very cool that they added that camera badge it was fun to use time to time.\n\nthe story obviously doesnt need much explanation, better story than most platform games decades ago I suppose. Again it was creative and is definitely disctintive in the genre of games its in. imagine if there was like a part two? new items with more platforming elements? as someone whos played the game, i wouldnt mind seeing another(if its good though!). wanting to replay it again is soon to be seen, perhaps if i get a controller and speedrun this game at some point in the future. Its one of those come back and visit ever so often. controller motions are definitely speedrun friendly! great game, great time(get it?) I would put it up there on the shelf of what makes platforming games enjoyale and fun. obviously not perfect, but to my standards of rating this one is a high 4.5/5 stars!  \n\nthanks to anyone who read this far, It was one of those days ya feel like typing a review.\n\nEDIT: I totally forgot to mention the music and sound effects in this. all in all, pretty good and connects with the whole theme. whismical, upbeat, goofy. really nice icing on the lava cake!", "timestamp_created": 1735892881, "timestamp_updated": 1735976823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184607781": {"recommendationid": "184607781", "author": {"steamid": "76561199537649496", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1281, "playtime_at_review": 838, "deck_playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1737162257}, "language": "english", "review": "stop looking at reviews and buy this game right now, the artstyle, music, and gameplay are all amazing, and you're missing out on an incredible platformer\n", "timestamp_created": 1735890929, "timestamp_updated": 1735890929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "184604113": {"recommendationid": "184604113", "author": {"steamid": "76561199784618931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 975, "last_played": 1737173772}, "language": "english", "review": "Would recommend using controller, tho, GREAT STORY, love the art style, lovely mods, super duper creative, and best of all...\r\n\r\n                                                                         S M U G    DANCE", "timestamp_created": 1735886620, "timestamp_updated": 1735886620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184602706": {"recommendationid": "184602706", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990920031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 871, "last_played": 1671917694}, "language": "english", "review": "4/5 Imaginative and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1735884988, "timestamp_updated": 1735884988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184602560": {"recommendationid": "184602560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859786820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1735884695}, "language": "english", "review": "The platforming in this game is so fun!

Captura excepcionalmente a ess\u00eancia dos jogos collect-a-thon da era do 64 at\u00e9 a do Gamecube, e eu diria que esse jogo faz melhor do que a maioria dos jogos daquela \u00e9poca.\r\nAl\u00e9m disso, a hist\u00f3ria e os personagens s\u00e3o super charmosos e cheios de personalidade. E por mais que geralmente falem sobre esses aspectos do jogo, a gameplay, por mais que b\u00e1sica, n\u00e3o deixa a desejar.\r\nEntretanto, eu tenho duas cr\u00edticas. A primeira \u00e9 sobre a c\u00e2mera, que pode ser bem desengon\u00e7ada e desconfort\u00e1vel e muitos momentos, e por mais que habilitar as op\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00e2mera manual alivia bastante os problemas, eu ainda n\u00e3o acho ela muito boa, mas talvez essa seja a inten\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 que Super Mario 64 tem provavelmente a pior c\u00e2mera que eu j\u00e1 experienciei em um jogo de plataforma 3D na minha vida. A segunda cr\u00edtica n\u00e3o \u00e9 bem uma cr\u00edtica mas um problema de habilidade meu, e \u00e9 sobre o qu\u00e3o intuitivo o design \u00e9.
