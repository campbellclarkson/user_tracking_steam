Ce qui me s\u00e9duit avant tout dans ce jeu, c'est son r\u00e9alisme absolument bluffant. Les circuits sont reproduits \u00e0 la perfection gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la technologie de num\u00e9risation laser, capturant chaque asp\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la piste, chaque vibreur, et m\u00eame l'environnement alentour. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela une physique de conduite d'une pr\u00e9cision chirurgicale : les sensations de freinage, d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration, et la gestion des virages varient en fonction des conditions de course, du type de v\u00e9hicule et m\u00eame des r\u00e9glages que l'on choisit. On se croirait vraiment dans le cockpit d'une voiture de course.\r\n\r\nAu-del\u00e0 de cet aspect technique impressionnant, c'est la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 du jeu qui le rend encore plus addictif. iRacing est bien plus qu'un simple jeu : c'est une v\u00e9ritable plateforme pour les passionn\u00e9s de sports m\u00e9caniques. Son syst\u00e8me de classement (le fameux iRating) est con\u00e7u pour mettre en comp\u00e9tition des joueurs de niveau similaire, ce qui garantit des courses \u00e9quilibr\u00e9es et intenses. Cela cr\u00e9e une dynamique o\u00f9 chaque position compte et o\u00f9 l'am\u00e9lioration de ses comp\u00e9tences devient une v\u00e9ritable motivation. De plus, les comp\u00e9titions organis\u00e9es sont vari\u00e9es et souvent d'un niveau professionnel, attirant m\u00eame des pilotes r\u00e9els.\r\n\r\nCe que j'appr\u00e9cie particuli\u00e8rement, c'est que la communaut\u00e9 iRacing est tr\u00e8s engag\u00e9e et s\u00e9rieuse. Contrairement \u00e0 d'autres jeux de course, o\u00f9 les comportements parfois irresponsables peuvent g\u00e2cher l'exp\u00e9rience, ici, on trouve une v\u00e9ritable discipline. Les courses sont bien encadr\u00e9es, avec des r\u00e8gles strictes et une mod\u00e9ration efficace. Cela renforce l'immersion et le respect entre les pilotes.\r\n\r\nCertes, le mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique bas\u00e9 sur un abonnement et l'achat de contenu suppl\u00e9mentaire peut sembler dissuasif au premier abord. Mais pour moi, le niveau de d\u00e9tail, les mises \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une exp\u00e9rience comp\u00e9titive unique justifient largement cet investissement. C'est un jeu con\u00e7u pour les passionn\u00e9s, et il r\u00e9compense largement ceux qui s'y plongent pleinement.\r\n\r\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, iRacing est une exp\u00e9rience unique qui allie r\u00e9alisme, immersion et comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 \u00e0 un niveau rarement atteint. Si vous \u00eates un amateur de sports m\u00e9caniques, \u00e0 la recherche de d\u00e9fis authentiques et d'une communaut\u00e9 engag\u00e9e, alors ce jeu est fait pour vous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736787108, "timestamp_updated": 1736787108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185511889": {"recommendationid": "185511889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083474497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "playtime_at_review": 6327, "last_played": 1737405091}, "language": "english", "review": "alot of fun \r\nable to pratice set ups \r\nlearn what cars what on differnt tracks.", "timestamp_created": 1736776007, "timestamp_updated": 1736776007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185454203": {"recommendationid": "185454203", "author": {"steamid": "76561199532056248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "playtime_at_review": 1533, "last_played": 1737402880}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Na minha opini\u00e3o \u00e9 o melhor simulador de corrida que j\u00e1 joguei, depois que descobri este jogo, os ous outros simuladores pra mim ficaram arcade.\nNota m\u00e1xima para o iracing.", "timestamp_created": 1736702541, "timestamp_updated": 1736702541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185450105": {"recommendationid": "185450105", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968306500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 2052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1438, "playtime_at_review": 1884, "last_played": 1737282765}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0439. \r\n\r\n\u0414\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430. \r\n\r\n\u0414\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043a\u043f\u0438\u0442. \r\n\r\n\u0414\u0430 \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c 39 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u043c, \u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u044f \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c.\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0443 \u0438 \u0448\u043e?

There isn't anything like iRacing within the sim-racing sphere. At almot any time of the day, you'll find a race somewhere being ran. Drivers celebrating every victory like it is their last. Others relishing in the agony of defeat. \n\nIt's what made me finally take the jump. After 10+ years of sim-racing, it was more or less what I expected (which is a bit disappointing).\n\nIt's practically an MMO given the purchasing model and rather open-ended content structure. If there's a series you want to run, you'll be paying hand over fist for every track and car. If you want truly everything, it'll be thousands of dollars in addition to your standard subscription fee every month by the way..\n\nIf you're anything like me, you'll finally dip a toe in. Pick a few series you want to run based off of your real-life motorsport tastes..but grow annoyed with the uninutitive physics model.\nWhile improved from previous iterations, it still has several massive issues. To keep it somewhat brief\n- Tyres insanely sensitive to oversteer, tyre slip \n- Cars having too much aero relative to IRL counterparts\n- ABS & hybrid engine systems functioning unlike they do in real life\nNot to mention even larger issues that plague niche licenses like dirt road & dirt oval. (Don't even get me started on the plague that is the idea of a setup shop having a bloody subscription service when you are already paying a subscription for the service in the first place. How about a subscription for better overlays than the dated ones in-game too! Might as well make a five-layer lasagna out of all these money-milking services!)\n\nDon't get me wrong, the matchmaking system iRacing uses to populate their service is nearly 1/1 but it has its own flaws.\n\nYou start your journey with a rookie safety license which grants you access to beginner-friendly cars to help you figure out the basics of race procedure and racecraft. \n\n Even as you get into higher safety rating classes and higher splits, the racing standards don't improve. Of course this varies from license to license but generally is pretty hit or miss. If anything, they get worse as drivers get faster & faster; and more daring and reckless with their offensive driving manuvers. For example, when a B-class sportscar race with a average iRating (iRacing's ELO system) of 2.2k is filled with more dangerous drivers than a comparable lobby in C-class with a average rating of 1.5k, then surely there is something wrong right? I can't imagine putting in the effort to get a fairly high iRating in your favorite class only for the racing standards to improve marginally or even get worse in some cases.\n\n I've seen people chalk most of this up to the growth of sim racing since the pandemic (the more apples you pick, the more rotten you'll find) but I think it's two-fold. iRacing's flawed, no-fault safety rating system contributes to this too. Using the same hand to punish someone avoiding an incident or getting caught up in another racer's reckless mess as you do if they are wrecking people just didn't make sense to me. It's a complicated issue that I don't really know if it has any answer. Maybe it's me getting burnt out and disappointed with the overall experience with the service but the general lack of a racing standard, particuarly across the road racing licenses is what shocked me. \n\nNot to mention the hivemind of a community who will sycophantically praise iRacing for its feature list (which is already being replicated for a much cheaper cost for other devs or community members of other titles) while deflecting any and all  critique back at frustrated users.\n\n\n(I'm no world-beater, for what it's worth. My iR across sportscar sits around 1.8k and 1.7k in open-wheelers. Oval, dirt oval and dirt road are there or even higher. I know I've raced way too much and won often enough in the six months I've been on iRacing to know that I don't completely suck.)\n\nNevertheless, if you have the patience, time and most importantly, money to pay the costs to truly get everything you'd want out of iRacing (it being your main hobby of choice), then I'd say go for it.\n\nIf you're a average or above average sim racer who wants to actually enjoy the hobby and not waste a bunch of money, then stick with titles like Automoblista 2 and Assetto Corsa. Not to forget older titles like rFactor 2, GTR2, NR2003, or even older titles like the fantastic Grand Prix Series or the underrated IndyCar Racing II.\n\nThere's plenty of ways to enjoy this hobby in a fun & healthy way; I think for most people, iRacing doesn't factor into that. It's too costly given the amount of glaring issues it has and I simply cannot recommend it for that reason at this time.", "timestamp_created": 1736599674, "timestamp_updated": 1736824871, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755652010440826416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185336898": {"recommendationid": "185336898", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096863837", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 398, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1736596821}, "language": "polish", "review": ".\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736590893, "timestamp_updated": 1736590893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185329608": {"recommendationid": "185329608", "author": {"steamid": "76561199610652949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 762, "playtime_at_review": 1958, "last_played": 1737314948}, "language": "italian", "review": "niceeee", "timestamp_created": 1736582242, "timestamp_updated": 1736582242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185320073": {"recommendationid": "185320073", "author": {"steamid": "76561199278028160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 336, "playtime_at_review": 45027, "last_played": 1736548484}, "language": "english", "review": "I love sim racing...I hate iRacing...but it's \"OK\" sometimes.
