The combat is actiony, fast-paced, and combo-driven; each character has a different playstyle and the sound effects make the combat feel impactful. The game's hub-based, but the levels are varied enough and don't get too repetitive, although the levels look bland and uninspired. The story is generic, and I can't say I remember much from the cutscenes or the dialogue with NPCs.\n\nMy problem with the game is that there aren't many players in the early levels, so it becomes boring after a while, as you'll mostly be doing missions solo. If you use the level boosts that they freely offer from time to time, you'll find some players at higher levels. But boosting is also problematic, as you'll be lost on what to do next if you start at the end-game, and the game doesn't do a good job explaining all the different activities available, and it's a bit frustrating trying to figure out what to do or where to go next.\n\nClosers also has a cash shop, selling a lot of costumes, boosters, upgrades and other bullshit, but I haven't spent too much time in it; it just looks like your typical F2P cash shop.\n\nIt might be fun for a couple of hours, but after a while you'll just get bored and move on to something with a bigger playerbase, something that doesn't feel like an online single-player game.", "timestamp_created": 1736428811, "timestamp_updated": 1736428811, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568400561809539795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185140983": {"recommendationid": "185140983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813167834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 172674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172674, "last_played": 1621534966}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430-\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 ^_^", "timestamp_created": 1736374318, "timestamp_updated": 1736374318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185135353": {"recommendationid": "185135353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961315413", "num_games_owned": 1204, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 787, "last_played": 1516489542}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was fun for when i did play it; just got repetitive then i forgot about it.
