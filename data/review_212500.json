The story quests are engaging, exploring is fun and rewarding (and not in a 'ticking off a checklist' kinda way, but in a 'whoa that place is cool' kinda way), and it feels true to the spirit of Tolkien's legendarium. The game doesn't try to rush you to endgame, instead letting you enjoy exploring middle-earth on your long and epic quests. However, if you do care about raiding or pvp, you're probably better off playing a more modern MMO. There's some of that here, but its not the game's strongest suit.\n\nThe people you'll meet are just lovely. People are actually friendly and kind to their fellows, even when grouping with randoms, and there's a lot of patience for people who are learning the game. There's this vibe that most people aren't in a rush, we're all just taking our time and smelling the pipeweed. At least thats my experience on Gladden, I haven't played the other servers.\n\nI stopped playing the game a few years ago, after the world mobs started getting a bit too easy. I felt the sense of danger was gone, which made questing across middle earth feel less like an adventure and more like a grind. However, I recently found out that a difficulty system was implemented for the world questing. You can turn up the difficulty for just yourself so you can go back to getting unceremoniously murdered by packs of wolves because you messed up your gambits, just as Eru intended. Very cool stuff!\n\nAs a huge Tolkien fan, I can also say this game mostly fits in with the lore. You can't be too strict on it as it is after all an MMO, so there are certain things that don't fit. For instance, the window of time in which the story quests had to have happened is dubiously small for how much you're getting done. There are two magic-user classes (lore-master which uses elf-lore to do things like set kindling on fire or heal fellows, and rune-keeper which uses the power of words to zap people or heal them), and while they made some effort to make these work lore-wise, its obviously quite iffy, especially for non-elves. Rune-Keeper is super fun though.\n\nHowever, aside from that, there are plenty of creatures and characters who don't appear in the books, but who feel right at home in Tolkien's world. The designers clearly love Lord of the Rings, and they have a lot of fun with exploring the less fleshed out parts of the legendarium - such as what Nameless Things dwell in the pits of Moria? Who is the Mouth of Sauron? How did Durin VII renew the former glory of the dwarves? etc. There's also plenty of stuff that is in the books, including the big battles like Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith. You can even join the Grey Company and travel the path of Dunharrow with Aragorn. So lots to love here for lord of the rings fans.\n\nOverall, if you're into lord of the rings and/or you enjoy the social, story, and exploration aspects of MMOs more than endgame, you need to play this game !", "timestamp_created": 1737270491, "timestamp_updated": 1737270752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185915793": {"recommendationid": "185915793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061287553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1701, "playtime_at_review": 2510, "last_played": 1737264273}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a really great interpretation of the world of middle earth.

Since its launch in 2007, it has provided players with an opportunity to walk the paths of Frodo, Aragorn, and the Fellowship. In 2025, LOTRO is both a testament to the enduring power of Tolkien\u2019s world and an example of the challenges of keeping an aging MMORPG relevant. Here\u2019s a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses across key categories:\r\n\r\nStory: A Tolkien Lover\u2019s Dream\r\nRating: 9/10\r\n\r\nLOTRO\u2019s storytelling is its crown jewel. From the sprawling epic quests that run parallel to the events of The Lord of the Rings to the rich side stories that delve into the history and culture of Middle-earth, the game offers a narrative experience unmatched by most MMORPGs. Whether you\u2019re helping Aragorn reclaim his heritage or assisting a local farmer in the Shire, the writing feels authentic and deeply rooted in Tolkien\u2019s lore.\r\n\r\nThe world-building is meticulous, and every region\u2014from the rolling hills of the Shire to the haunting plains of Angmar\u2014feels alive with history. For fans of Tolkien, LOTRO is a love letter to Middle-earth, and its ability to immerse players in the world is second to none.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pacing can feel slow, especially for newer players unused to the game\u2019s leisurely approach to storytelling. Some quests still rely on dated \u201cfetch-and-kill\u201d mechanics, but the richness of the narrative makes up for these shortcomings.\r\n\r\nGraphics: Ugly but Charming\r\nRating: 5/10\r\n\r\nLOTRO\u2019s graphics are, to put it kindly, a relic of a bygone era. While the game\u2019s art direction strives to capture the beauty of Middle-earth, the execution falls short by modern standards. Character models are stiff, textures are blurry, and the environments, while artistically ambitious, lack the technical polish of contemporary games.\r\n\r\nThat said, there\u2019s a certain charm to LOTRO\u2019s aesthetic. The landscapes, particularly in regions like Rohan or Rivendell, can still evoke awe if you squint past the technical limitations. The game\u2019s lighting and skyboxes occasionally deliver moments of surprising beauty, but overall, LOTRO struggles to compete visually with even mid-tier games in 2025.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Dated but Functional\r\nRating: 6/10\r\n\r\nLOTRO\u2019s gameplay shows its age, with combat and movement mechanics that feel clunky and sluggish compared to modern MMORPGs. The tab-targeting system and dated UI can be off-putting to new players, and long-time veterans have likely grown accustomed to the quirks more out of habit than preference.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game compensates for its mechanical shortcomings with depth. The class system is diverse, offering unique playstyles, and the crafting and housing systems are robust for those who enjoy these aspects of MMORPGs. Skirmishes and instances provide group content, but the mechanics feel basic compared to the dynamic encounters seen in newer games.\r\n\r\nA major boon is the tireless effort of the small development team, which consistently releases updates to improve quality of life, add content, and address community concerns. While the gameplay isn\u2019t revolutionary, the love and care put into maintaining it are evident.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity: The Beating Heart of the Game\r\nRating: 10/10\r\n\r\nLOTRO\u2019s community is one of the most welcoming and passionate you\u2019ll find in any MMORPG. From in-game role-playing groups to large-scale concerts hosted by player bands, the community consistently breathes life into Middle-earth. If you\u2019re a fan of cooperative gameplay or social interactions, LOTRO delivers in spades.\r\n\r\nPlayers are eager to help newcomers, and there\u2019s a strong sense of camaraderie among fans of Tolkien\u2019s work. The game fosters an environment that feels more like a fellowship than a collection of strangers. If anything, the community is the reason many players stick with the game despite its technical flaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Performance: A Major Drawback\r\nRating: 4/10\r\n\r\nLOTRO\u2019s technical issues are its Achilles\u2019 heel. The 32-bit servers suffer from horrendous lag and frequent crashes, particularly in densely populated areas or during major in-game events. These performance problems are a constant source of frustration and mar an otherwise immersive experience.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming 64-bit servers are a beacon of hope for the future, promising smoother performance and addressing many of the long-standing issues. However, until they are fully implemented and optimized, LOTRO\u2019s technical struggles remain a significant barrier for both new and returning players.\r\n\r\nSound: A Middle-earth Symphony\r\nRating: 8/10\r\n\r\nLOTRO\u2019s sound design is a highlight. The music, composed by Chance Thomas and others, captures the spirit of Middle-earth beautifully. From the tranquil melodies of the Shire to the stirring battle themes of Mordor, the soundtrack adds depth and emotion to the game.\r\n\r\nVoice acting is sparse, but where it exists, it\u2019s serviceable. Environmental sound effects, like the rustle of leaves or the distant call of an eagle, enhance the sense of immersion. While not perfect, the audio design is one of the game\u2019s more polished aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict: A Flawed but Endearing Journey\r\nOverall Rating: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe Lord of the Rings Online in 2025 is a mixed bag. It\u2019s a game of contrasts: breathtaking storytelling marred by dated gameplay, a magnificent community hindered by technical shortcomings, and a world full of charm that struggles under the weight of its aging infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFor Tolkien fans, LOTRO remains a must-play. A one-month VIP subscription is enough to experience the highlights\u2014exploring iconic locations, delving into the epic storylines, and soaking in the community\u2019s creativity. However, it\u2019s hard to recommend as a long-term investment unless you\u2019re deeply committed to Middle-earth and willing to overlook the game\u2019s numerous flaws. It\u2019s a journey worth taking for the love of Tolkien\u2019s world, but not without its bumps along the road.", "timestamp_created": 1737027048, "timestamp_updated": 1737027048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185698938": {"recommendationid": "185698938", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972845249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2564, "playtime_at_review": 2460, "last_played": 1737123096}, "language": "french", "review": "Un MMO \u00e0 l'ancienne, avec de belles m\u00e9caniques et un univers passionnant.

The link to their website wasn't working, the site wouldn't even load. Again, after several tries it loaded. And now comes the part that made me quit the whole thing: Account creation. Boy how bad could it be?\n\nFirst account name. Fair enough. Then your password. For this you have to check several requirements. It has to be between 8-16 characters long, it has to contain a letter and a number and it only allows for letters, numerical values and special characters. It doesn't give you the opportunity to create your own password if it doesn't follow these restrictive rules.\nAnd then my favorite part: Your birth date! But nothing you click in the list works. It always says \"Please enter a valid birth date\". So all birth dates are invalid and you cannot create an account. And this was the final straw. How hard can it be to make an account? How about impossible?\n\nEdit: And when you finally can create an account, you will be searching hours for a valid name for your character! I tried random combinations and strangely not a single one was valid. Guess you have to name your human \"FancyPants263\" for 1-262 are already taken...

This can become a pain with crafting and I'm sure there's more getting into the higher levels. You can buy more storage out right for a not so crazy amount of money (compared to newer money hungry games). The other option is to become a VIP member and automatically get more. So far, I'm hooked and I'm pretty sure I'll be subscribing as a VIP member for the discounted yearly rate once I dive even deeper.", "timestamp_created": 1736306921, "timestamp_updated": 1736306921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185059085": {"recommendationid": "185059085", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387141750", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1736947613}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best MMO around.", "timestamp_created": 1736291726, "timestamp_updated": 1736291726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185057539": {"recommendationid": "185057539", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221857556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1736290382}, "language": "turkish", "review": "oooooo", "timestamp_created": 1736289980, "timestamp_updated": 1736289980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185047812": {"recommendationid": "185047812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029561555", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 9743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1788, "playtime_at_review": 8472, "last_played": 1737138755}, "language": "english", "review": "This game deserves a lot better.

The world-building is fantastic, and the storytelling stays faithful to the source material, which makes it even more enjoyable. The game does look a bit dated (which gives it a charming old-school vibe that I personally like), and the UI is for ants on 1440p. Despite all these quirks, LOTRO is a blessing for anyone who loves Middle-earth. The community in this game is amazing\u2014players are very friendly and always willing to help.\n\nOne of the best recent changes is the introduction of \"legendary servers.\" These servers not only solve the game's server lag issues but also offer a progression system similar to WoW Classic. I decided to start on a legendary server, and it was hands down the best choice I could have made as a new player. Experiencing each expansion slowly, as if they're launching for the first time, has been so fun. When I first tried the game in 2019, I was overwhelmed by the level cap and the sheer amount of content. This time, the legendary server has made the experience feel much more approachable and fun. I've been enjoying my LOTRO adventure so much that I couldn't even stop playing during my holiday break lol.\n\nOverall, I believe this game will remain one of my favorite MMOs.

I do love the world, mechanics, questing all that, but as soon as my inventory got filled with those chests you can unlock needing a key, which in return you can get with irl currency in the shop, i was done for it. \nSurely you get those coins for completing task aswell but imo you can clearly see the hidden greed making money here. I wouldnt mind if those chest would have dropped rarely and become some sort of reward thing in the open world, but after an evening playing 10 slots of my inv were taken by those chests. A big downsight for me in mmo's or rpgs in general is when you get cool stuff for money instead of working for it. Another thing which started to bother me was the typical f2p exp scroll here, comfort item there thingi which also fill your inventory almost every day. Surely you can remove those if you dont like it or just use em, but throwing away a rather decent XP buff is still stupid. I dont understand why giving a player those things in he first place. For me this just ruined the game and made this actually pretty game feel like the typical bad build f2p mmo from eastern countries due to its systems (Having a mount tied to one char only, but pay more for it to be account wide. Buy a cheap mount but its still slower than the slightly more expensive one. This may not apply to ppl who play this game for longer and have gotten ingame mounts alrdy which also have a 68% speed buff, but new players dont). Please dont get me wrong here. You, who might reads this and enjoys the game to its core; I'm really happy for you and I understand you. This is just an impression of a literaly new player to this game.\nSurely i have to admit that since this is f2p the devs need/want to have a way to make money. But in lotro it just feels awkward.\nAnother thing which was limiting my playtime experience was the bad UI. Caught myself a few times wondering where i can find certain stuff. For me this is just bad navigation and is fairly outdated. Especially an UI should be one of the things devs should consider to build as good as possible. New players may get overwhelmed by it and become frustrated by the design etc.\nOne more thing which insanley limited the fun i had playing was the bad server performance. God damn... sometimes waiting 20 seconds for the server to catch up again and leaving my freeze state. Yes, they do have vip servers which you can enter by paying the typical monthly sub price, but even these have smaller hickups from time to time. they are by far not as bad but its still sad. There is not a single MMO i play/ played so far which has similar server issues. (Also, Why have a \"strong\" f2p shop monetisation and gameplay elements when having this monthly pay system.. dont get it)\n\nSo, Great game but feels weird at some points :)\nFor people who want to dive into this world and just enjoy it I do recommend this game.
