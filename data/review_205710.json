Its flaws only being that the games it inspired (WoW FFXII) took too much from its endgame and caused the homogenization of the genre. There are about 20-40k active players, while many multibox to camp, raid etc. It is very difficult for a new player to fit in due to either an obscene amount of grinding (levels 1-125, which is fast until it plateaus at around 80, years worth of invaluable mechanics and AAs needing to be unlocked, or Krono (The EQ equivalent of a WoW token spawning a mafia on all the latest TLPs to gut organic gameplay and cause you to buy Krono to advance)). These problems however are due to the age of the genre, and in the prime of this game, none of them were nearly as extant.\n\nI would recommend staying away from TLPs since they are more endgame focused (the live servers are too but you will find that there are some good samaritans that will help you level on them), and the endgame is arguably the weakest point of EQ and MMOs in general.\nBristlebane or Fironia Vie are F2P servers conducive to a new player, the former more than the latter due to its loot rules.

Years ago when the game came out it was great, I started playing this on my first account right when Shadows of Luclin came out. It was my first journey into the world of MMORPGs and was a fun experience, I played for years up until just before EverQuest 2 was released, and I would often come back to the game periodically just so see how things were. What makes me not recommend this game is because it like many other games like it have fallen into a cash grab/pay to win black hole that have befallen many games like it. When the game was owned and run by Sony Online Entertainment the game was great, but when Daybreak Games started running it it became nothing more than a Pay 2 Win Cash Grab. You are stuck with only one starting area, and the experience gain is so slow while those who pay for the game get double exp, which is fine if you can afford it, but not everyone can and when you team up with a friend who started at the exact some time you did and is five to ten levels higher than you it makes the experience of leveling together seem depressing at worse.
