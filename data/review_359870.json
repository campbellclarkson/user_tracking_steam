Completing the game 100% without a guide is nearly impossible, and going for the platinum trophy is a test of patience.\r\n\r\nOverall, this remaster is a great package for fans of classic RPGs, but be prepared for a time-consuming journey if you're aiming for full completion.", "timestamp_created": 1737167304, "timestamp_updated": 1737167304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185822986": {"recommendationid": "185822986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830689830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2711, "playtime_at_review": 5067, "last_played": 1737161809}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "muito bom", "timestamp_created": 1737163660, "timestamp_updated": 1737163660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185815554": {"recommendationid": "185815554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198823275310", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 147, "playtime_at_review": 1954, "last_played": 1737154364}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Lend\u00e1rio.", "timestamp_created": 1737154393, "timestamp_updated": 1737154393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185811470": {"recommendationid": "185811470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143967513", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2472, "last_played": 1710522646}, "language": "spanish", "review": "FFX: chiquita aguantada de llorera al final.

\r\nWith updated visuals, refined audio, and a bundled sequel, this package is a treasure trove for fans and newcomers alike.\r\nThe heart and soul of Final Fantasy X lies in its story and characters. \r\nTidus and Yuna, the protagonists, are the emotional core of the narrative. \r\nTheir journey is one of love, sacrifice, and hope, themes that are beautifully interwoven with the game\u2019s rich lore and world-building. \r\nSpira, the world they inhabit, feels alive, vibrant, and steeped in culture, making every location memorable, from the serene Besaid Island to the haunting Zanarkand ruins.\r\nThe combat system, built around the Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) mechanics, is intuitive yet deeply strategic, allowing players to plan their moves with precision. \r\nThe Sphere Grid, used for character progression, adds a satisfying layer of customization and growth, ensuring every battle feels meaningful. \r\nFor returning players, the inclusion of the Expert Sphere Grid in the remaster is a welcome challenge.\r\nVisually, the remaster elevates the game to modern standards with enhanced character models, improved textures, and vibrant lighting effects. \r\nThe re-orchestrated soundtrack adds a fresh yet familiar tone to the experience, though purists will be pleased to find the option to switch back to the original score.\r\nFinal Fantasy X-2, on the other hand, feels like a step down from its predecessor... \r\nWhile it offers a lighter and more adventurous tone, its narrative lacks the depth and emotional resonance of Final Fantasy X. \r\nThe Dressphere system, though unique, can feel gimmicky and fails to capture the strategic brilliance of the Sphere Grid. \r\nHowever, the game's 'perfect' ending, where Tidus reunites with Yuna, is a standout moment that alone makes the sequel worth playing. \r\nIt provides a sense of closure and satisfaction that fans of their love story will truly appreciate!\r\nThat said, Final Fantasy X remains the highlight of the package. \r\nTidus and Yuna\u2019s relationship is heartfelt and central to the game\u2019s emotional impact, making their moments together, from the iconic laughter scene to the unforgettable ending, resonate deeply. \r\nTheir bond is a testament to the game\u2019s exceptional storytelling.\r\nFor those who missed these games the first time around, this remaster is the perfect opportunity to experience two beloved titles. \r\nFor longtime fans like me, it\u2019s a chance to relive cherished memories in a more polished and immersive way. \r\nFinal Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is a must-play collection that stands as a testament to why Final Fantasy has endured as one of gaming\u2019s greatest franchises.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1736828277, "timestamp_updated": 1736828277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185551889": {"recommendationid": "185551889", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004403054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3041, "playtime_at_review": 491, "last_played": 1737117357}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even need to say how good this game is, it still holds up in 2025 imo. can't beat the classics", "timestamp_created": 1736823726, "timestamp_updated": 1736823726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185493611": {"recommendationid": "185493611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268146774", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1379, "playtime_at_review": 2711, "last_played": 1736747130}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2e8\uc810\r\n\r\n1. \ud134\uc81c\uac8c\uc784 \uc18d\ud130\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \ub2f5\ub2f5\ud568\r\n2. \ub300\ud654 \uc2a4\ud0b5 \uc548\ub428.

I played this game once when it was on PS2. I lost my entire childhood playing it. When I saw that it was on sale on Steam, I had to buy it to refresh my memories related to it. the plot, adventures, characters, etc. of the music are amazing, you can choose from older versions of this music or you can take the newer ones, there is a slight difference, and the plot is wonderfully done. If you are a fan of Fantasy or RPG, or if you are interested in your first experience with this category of games, I recommend Final Fantasy, other parts are also great, I recommend buying them on sale, although the price of this game is good for me.

The level of nostalgia I feel when diving back into this game is hard to put into words.

Playing through again, this time pushing for 100% completion, felt like reconnecting with an old friend. Spending time with these characters and immersing myself in Spira\u2019s world was even more fulfilling than I expected. There\u2019s a certain magic in its story and setting that just pulls you in.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about picking this up, I\u2019d absolutely recommend it. Take your time with the story; it\u2019s worth savouring. Sure, the English dub can be a bit rough around the edges, and some of the character designs\u2014especially for the women\u2014can feel a little over-the-top. But if you can look past those quirks, the gameplay and narrative make the journey well worth it.\n\nWhether you\u2019re returning to Spira or experiencing it for the first time, Final Fantasy X HD Remaster is a timeless classic that\u2019s still got that X-factor.", "timestamp_created": 1736497989, "timestamp_updated": 1736497989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185237601": {"recommendationid": "185237601", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026297469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4179, "playtime_at_review": 4348, "last_played": 1737381314}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5267\u60c5\u8d85\u7ea7\u8d5e\uff0c\u522b\u7684\u4e5f\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1736494605, "timestamp_updated": 1736494605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185235593": {"recommendationid": "185235593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966338579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 13275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13275, "deck_playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1708111121}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an absolute masterpiece.

The lore is great. \nAfter the initial action sequence, the story takes some time to get going. The game is linear, which suits a pilgrimage story where you travel with a group of characters from town to town. The characters are easy to recognise, but most of them, with the exception of the two protagonists, are rather one-dimensional. Their journey is accompanied by a spiritual atmosphere, supported by excellent music, interesting locations, and memorable cutscenes. Unfortunately, the cutscenes cannot be skipped, which can be annoying when you have to replay a battle and watch them all over again. As for the music, Final Fantasy X has two of my favourite piano songs, with \"To Zanarkand\" being one of the best pieces of music in the series. \nThis is the first Final Fantasy to use a 3D engine, and although it now looks dated, especially in terms of facial expressions and animations, it still manages to capture the unique atmosphere and tone of its world Spira. Unfortunately, the game can suffer from occasional crashes on modern PCs running at high resolutions, as memory settings were restricted at the time.\nThe difficulty is manageable up to a point towards the end of the game, where it suddenly spikes and becomes extremely difficult - unfortunately you have to grind random encounters to level up.I like the ATB combat system in FFX because you can always swap characters during combat, which makes combat quite dynamic, and you can swap out characters with low health or swap in characters to exploit a particular enemy weakness. However, as with previous games, combat can get a bit repetitive and tiresome after a while. The character upgrade system allows for customisation, but it could have been better presented visually as it does not provide a good overview. \nAside from combat, there is a major mini-game called Blitzball, a football-like underwater game with team management, which is quite fun but also optional.\nWhat I dislike are the random encounters and the puzzles in the temples: the type of puzzle is always the same, but gets more and more complex. You solve them by trial and error, which is fine for the first temples, but less fun for the later ones. Another point of criticism is the English translation and voice acting, which could have been better. Another small negative is that the characters' reactions are sometimes not plausible (they do not ask questions or remain simply silent).\nOverall, FFX is a great game, because of the story it tells and the atmosphere it creates.\n\n---\n\nFinal Fantasy X/2 (FFX/2) is a direct sequel that has a very different, light-hearted, not-too-serious tone, similar to Charlie's Angles, where you go on various missions with a group of three girls. I think it's fun, but some fans may have wanted a more consistent and serious sequel to FFX. The party consists of Yuna and Rikku, as well as Paine - the new girl. Unfortunately, Paine's characterisation remains flat throughout the game.\nStory-wise, I like that FFX/2 deals with the question of what the heroes do after the great adventure (of FFX) is over. How does life go on? The story in FFX/2 is not as strong as in FFX, but I think it's fitting. However, the game designers couldn't seem to agree on an ending: the endings in FFX/2 are watered down, and earlier events are completely undone by later additions, which I think is a big narrative mistake. One of the additions is the final mission, which I like because it deals with conflicts between the main trio and fleshes out their characters. I wish moments like this were already in the main game of FFX/2. For me, the default \"sad\" ending is the true ending. There is also a \"perfect\" ending if you complete the game at 100%, but this is almost impossible to achieve without external guides and is extremely time consuming.\nFFX/2 uses most of the same assets as FFX, which is a shame as there are hardly any new locations. At least there are no more puzzle temples from FFX. \nThe combat system is new, based on a \"job\" system, here called dress. You can no longer switch characters during a fight, but you can change dresses, which allows you to react to different enemies. I like how the combatants automatically move and change positions during combat, giving the impression of a dynamic battle. The difficulty of FFX/2 also rises sharply towards the end of the game, so grinding will be necessary.", "timestamp_created": 1736107488, "timestamp_updated": 1736107488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184860092": {"recommendationid": "184860092", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073068046", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 860, "playtime_at_review": 3331, "last_played": 1736893858}, "language": "latam", "review": "es muy buen juego como para traer recuerdos de cuando jugabas a la play 2, merecido jugarlo", "timestamp_created": 1736102573, "timestamp_updated": 1736102573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184858970": {"recommendationid": "184858970", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988577704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 10824, "deck_playtime_at_review": 2301, "last_played": 1736681295}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just a review for Final Fantasy X, not X-2, as I've never managed to get into the extremely tonally different sequel enough to play it for more than a couple hours:\n\nA contender for my all time favourite game. I first played it as a kid, but I've played it many times since - so I know it isn't just nostalgia I'm feeling. In terms of fantasy settings, it's unmatched - the story, the world and the characters are all fantastic. The voice acting is spot-on - don't take the laughing memes too seriously - that scene is touching when you see it in context. The sphere grid levelling system is so good, that I'm bewildered as to why it hasn't since been built upon or replicated by at least Square Enix. Like the game itself, this system is linear at first, but then opens up later on and is complex enough to be engaging without being a nuisance. Music - it's stellar. Art design - that too. Honestly, the only thing I could even point out as being less that excellent are a few specific side quests that felt a bit clunky.\n\nIf you've got experience of other Final Fantasy's but never found them all that special, don't let that put you off this one, it easily out-shines the rest of the series (yes, I think it's better than 7, by far).\n\nAside from the high praises I give the game itself, the port could have been better.

X-2, however, is in a slightly more precarious position. I played it back when it originally came out, and I completed it 100%. This is a game I had very good memories of, and was actually really excited to get back into... My overall impression of it now, as I try to claw my way through its campaign, is not as positive as I'd like.\r\n\r\nSome of it is still great: I still think the battle system is really nice, and I like the class-changing mechanic. I vaguely remember this game being lambasted for being \"too girly\", with the \"dresspheres\" lending some sort of a \"magical girl\" vibe to the game that many didn't appreciate. I, for one, really liked it, and still think it gives the game a very unique and pleasant atmosphere. The facial animations are also a clear step up from its predecessor. That's... about all the good that I can say about it.\r\nThe story is absolutely painful to get through. I did not remember Brother being so annoying and so present in the game. Any scene involving Yuna in almost any way feels awkward. No one in the entire world (aside from Maechen) seems to treat her with the respect and reverence that she is due. I understand the attempt to make things more lighthearted, but it feels super stilted and forced. The mission structure is cool, but it's also very punishing if you want to engage with the game without assistance, as you will get a shit ending and have to redo the whole thing. There is a very neat NG+ mechanic, but that does not excuse the busy work involved.\r\n\r\nAnother thing worth highlighting is in regards to versions: \r\nThe ones packed here are the \"International\" versions of both games. This means they have extra stuff, bits that weren't part of the original release. I find these releases to pretty much always be misses... The stuff added is always just padding. You can ignore most of it pretty safely, but if you are keen on 100%-ing stuff, the runtime of these games has been MASSIVELY inflated with the addition of the Dark Aeon stuff on X and the creature capture mechanic in X-2. And none of it is super interesting. Although, if you are curious and analytical, you might get a kick at how the monster mechanics in X-2 might have informed XIII-2's design.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said and done, I'm happy I got to revisit these games, but I don't think I'd replay these versions ever. I'd sooner bust out the PS2 and play the original release of X. As for X-2... OOF. That one I'm probably leaving alone for a long time... Which saddens me, in a way. I wish I could have stayed with my memories of it being a great game instead of being proven otherwise.

It may not be as ground-shaking as it was when originally released 20 years ago, but the main cast is still very likable with their interesting backstories, and the main plot line has a few interesting twists. The game still holds up mechanically, with fights being interesting, unique sphere grid leveling system and some pretty cool bosses. Moment to moment gameplay is still enjoyable after all these years.\n\nThe bad:\nI'll pass over graphics, because everyone can see how the game looks like, and while it is not ugly, it definitely is old, even with new HD textures. My main issue with the game was amount of grind it excepts from the player, bosses that will just one-hit your whole party if you didn't grind enough levels, and side content hidden behind even more grind that is just ridiculous if you are aiming for 100% completion. I guess it's just old PS2 jRPG design school.\n\nOverall - I think is a good game still worth playing, especially if you can grab it on a sale for pennies. Just get UnX mod that will help with some annoying bits of the old engine, like not being able to skip cutscenes, which without the mod can be very annoying if you retry the same boss 5th time and

This strong feel of a true \"adventure\" makes it incredibly unique and standing out from anything else I've played before.\n\nI loved how, over time, along with the main protagonist, you get deeply invested in the characters and the world. The world-building is phenomenal, each area feels distinct, with its own vibe, creatures, story, and music. This variety adds up so much to this feeling of traveling through a living world. Overall, it felt like a breath of fresh air in its uniqueness compared to typical modern fantasy tropes.\n\nThe OST is simply beautiful. Right from the start, when you boot up the game, you are greeted with the iconic piece \"To Zanarkand\". You just sit there thinking: \"Yep, the entire score would be a masterpiece\" -  and it absolutely is.\n\nI am not a fan of random encounters, but here, while they were occasionally tedious, they felt okay because the combat system is great. Each character has a ton of abilities, and being able to swap them mid-fight keeps the gameplay engaging. Every enemy has its strengths and weaknesses, which means you are constantly coming up with some kind of strategies. I find the process of figuring out the best approach to each enemy and boss very satisfying.\n\nThe leveling system is also great. The massive grid might seem scary, but once you figure it out, it becomes a lot of fun. Each character starts in a different position on the grid, but generally you can build them as you like, similar to Path of Exile. This made leveling up and random encounters feel rewarding.\n\nI was recommended FFX as a starting point for the Final Fantasy series, and I absolutely loved it.
