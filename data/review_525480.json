Perhaps it was great back in the PS2 days, but the gameplay has not aged well. [/b] [/h1]\n\n[h1]PROS: [/h1]\n\u2705Four games in one package\n\u2705MMO mechanic concepts\n\u2705Great direction, no guide needed unless trying to 100%\n\n[h1]CONS: [/h1]\n\u2796Annoying and repetitive combat\n\u2796Bland and boring game world\n\u2796Constant logging out to check email\n\u2796No cloud saves(!)\n\u2796Excessive hand-holding\n\nNote: This game contains FOUR games. I may refer to games by their volume as follows: \nV1 = Rebirth\nV2 = Reminisce\nV3 = Redemption\nV4 = Reconnection\n[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative/Length) \u2013 [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\nGame World: .hack//G.U. Last Recode (.hack)  imitates the concept of players within an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) RPG. Much of the concepts you\u2019ll see in .hack are the same type of concepts that players familiar with MMO games deal with, for example, things like PKing are a core part of the plot and combat in .hack. I do really like the story setting of an MMO game, I feel this opens up a lot of creative possibilities. \n\n.hack contains two main parts of the game world - the desktop and the game \u201cThe World\u201d itself. The desktop is a simple menu containing basic information, like a community forum or your email, something that you\u2019ll be checking a LOT. The World is where the MMO is taking place. This kind of reminds me of something like Final Fantasy XI from a high-level perspective. You visit different areas, kill monsters, and witness a ton of story cutscenes. \n\nOverall, while I love the creativity, the game world itself is one of the most boring, bland, repetitive, and insufferable worlds I\u2019ve ever trekked through. As of this review I have only finished V2 and still often visit level 90 zones that are the same exact look and feel of the level 10 zones. It's just so painful going to the repeat zones, with zero exciting things other than the usual monsters/chests over and over and over again. \n\nNarrative: There is a heavy focus on the story for .hack games. It's a big part of the overall package. Again, the concepts of a story setting in an MMO sounds very intriguing to me - players that are killed in game are ending up in comas in real life! Unfortunately, I found articles in EVE Online that were more thrilling than anything .hack has. \n\nI think a part of it is the repetition. In both V1 and V2, a core part of the story is the boring arena. When I learned I have to slog through the arena all over again, I rolled my eyes and audibly said no. \nAnother part of it is the exaggeration. I get that this is a universe where technology has advanced and the game is played with something more advanced than a monitor. But every time a character died, all I could think of is Randy dying in the World of Warcraft South Park episode with how serious .hack characters refer to PVP. \n\nThe last part is just the anime tropes. The early 2000s were a different era, and of course .hack is an anime and was before it was a game, but it really just feels like I\u2019m playing an anime instead of a video game based on an anime. Like no real humans would act or talk in this way. Like one of those PR video game trailers where they include the live comms of multiplayer matches. Like you know players aren\u2019t like that, if that makes sense. \n\nLength: The entire package is very long. Expect to take ~20-25 hours on each of the 3 main title entries with much less for the 4th extra content. Even more so when you factor in side content, quests, and endgame min/maxing. \n\n[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) \u2013 [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\nMechanics: The core of the gameplay, and what you\u2019ll spend the majority of the time doing when you\u2019re not in a cutscene, is combat. I found the combat to be simple, repetitive, and boring, only barely picking up halfway into V2. \n\nV1 you will literally mash the attack button 95% of the time, with the remaining time being the occasional block or the weapon skill for the Rengeki combo. There\u2019s barely any sort of progression or customization with weapons or gear, you only have 3 slots to equip. You gain nothing on level up but I guess more HP/Attack/Defense. The few weapon skills you have are unexciting to use and just do damage but mainly serve as the only reason for your existence - Rengeki combos. And your AI companions are dumb as bricks and would die without you holding their hand through everything. \n\nI will end by saying if all this isn\u2019t bad enough, the combat is plain frustrating, especially in V2 as you progress. See, enemies will eventually start to CC you with things like sleep or paralyze, so you get the joy of watching your idiot companions attempt to kill things while you are CC\u2019d for 15 seconds. OR enemies will hit you with an attack, knock you back, and constantly float you if you miss time a block. One of my most hated elements of any game is when you take control away from the player, and this game does it CONSTANTLY. It's so fun charging up your weapons attacks only for an enemy to sneeze on you and interrupt everything. \n\nDifficulty: Incredibly easy. The only time you\u2019ll ever have any trouble is if you intentionally go to an area that is much higher level than you, but apparently the games EXP values have been adjusted to where grinding isn\u2019t necessary anymore. \n\n[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Performance) \u2013 [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\nQuality: Kinda bad. Graphics look like a slightly more HD PS2 game. Reminds me of a less detailed Final Fantasy X. I\u2019d say by far the worst part graphically of the game is the areas and all the copy pasted, low-res assets that just repeat endlessly. \n\nPerformance: Good, almost no issues at all with the game, I only experienced a single crash on V2. Otherwise, .hack kept a solid 60fps with no dips. \ni9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | installed on SSD\n\n[h1] [b] Audio (Sound Effects/Music) \u2013 [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\nSound Effects: Good enough. English voice acting is very good, apart from some characters like Endrance and his moaning whispery voice (Sorry Liam, much <3). \n\nMusic: Not bad, but largely forgettable, this is no Final Fantasy where the music is top notch. \n\n[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) \u2013 [2/10] [/b] [/h1]\nThere is some good amount of side content to play through, and achievements, but I have no idea why you\u2019d want to replay through the .hack games again other than nostalgia. \n\n[h1] [b] Final Verdict \u2013 [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\n.hack is one of the most easily mediocre games I\u2019ve ever played. It's just so bland, so boring, and a trial in patience. I wish the single player MMO game actually felt like an MMO, which is one of my favorite genres. \n\nThe best part about buying .hack//G.U. Last Recode is the amount of content that you get. Even if I didn\u2019t enjoy the games myself, you should consider a purchase when on sale due to having the most complete collection of .hack that is ever and might ever be on PC. I think I bought this game for ~$10 on sale and the amount of content you get for $10 is crazy, well over 60 hours, if you can stomach through the parts that didn\u2019t age well. \n\nFor me, I\u2019m going to take a break after V2 and take a long hard consideration before I start V3, if ever, so consider this my review for the game, otherwise, I\u2019ll edit it in the future. \n\n[h1] [b] Recommend?
