However, the story isn't executed very well. This game is well-known for Cecil's character development, however, his \"development\" happens in the opening cutscene and later on when he becomes a paladin it's just a class change when he doesn't change as a person. His actual character change is at the very beginning, which I wouldn't really call a change. It does have some dramatic moments, although they don't feel as impactful as the story progresses. That being said, it is still engaging. If you just treat it as a medieval action story about people going on a quest then it's still really good and will keep you hooked, but the character development and dramatic parts are a bit cringe.\r\n\r\nYou don't have full customization for classes since each character is basically their own class. However, each one has different abilities and you gain some abilities that you can assign to different characters. The auto battle system isn't as good as the pixel remasters since you have to choose what their auto battle actions are in a separate menu outside of combat, but there definitely is some strategy in choosing auto battle actions.\r\n\r\nThe game does have some voice acting, although it is pretty bad and makes the dramatic scenes really cringe. However, it's still good that it has voice acting unlike FF3 which has none. The cutscenes are still way better than what you'd get in the pixel remasters so if story is important to you then I'd pick this version over the pixel remaster.\r\n\r\nThe main downside of the game is that it's really difficult unless you grind a ton, and in some parts grinding is necessary, which can be really boring. I was just letting auto battle run while I was on my phone sometimes.\r\n\r\nOverall the game is pretty good, just definitely not as good as people say it is.", "timestamp_created": 1737141086, "timestamp_updated": 1737141086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185769959": {"recommendationid": "185769959", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112655960", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 11140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11140, "last_played": 1697921756}, "language": "english", "review": "The chests on the females are not 3-D didn't need to buy this", "timestamp_created": 1737105292, "timestamp_updated": 1737105292, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402310699224472046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185556163": {"recommendationid": "185556163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450988391", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2262, "playtime_at_review": 2251, "last_played": 1737176100}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "veri gudi", "timestamp_created": 1736830425, "timestamp_updated": 1736830425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185553371": {"recommendationid": "185553371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972505338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 7319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1501, "playtime_at_review": 7319, "deck_playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1736825469}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game so many times on the SNES.
