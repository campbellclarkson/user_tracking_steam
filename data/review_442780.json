This is a nice boomer-shooter game that has it's merits, but maaaaan does it get old fast. \n\nGame-play is as what'd you expect from a quake/doom-like game but it feels too floaty. The art-style is cool and the music is fun to listen to but it's not memorable. \n\nThe biggest flaw in this is most definitely the enemies that you fight. They're some of the worst I've had to endure from these types of games. they're way to damaging, have a lot of health and the the hit-boxes are abysmally small, especially those annoying worm things. these issues could have been ignored hadn't been for the egregiously stingy ammo pickups. How the hell am i supposed to fight with no ammo in a boomer-shooter man? \n\nOutside of that it's still a pretty nice short experience all-in-all. The themes of the game are cool and fun and with the art-style of this game, it complements it and serves it very well, and the game can look very unique at times. Also, the pacing is surprisingly good for what it's worth.\n\n7/10. Why not 8 or above? because it's short as hell. Sure, pacing is good but it's still too damn short. took me like 4 hours to finish this between 2 sessions.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1736729777, "timestamp_updated": 1736729777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185159932": {"recommendationid": "185159932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305624893", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1736021210}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Windows 11 cannot start this game.", "timestamp_created": 1736398104, "timestamp_updated": 1736398104, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184885113": {"recommendationid": "184885113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120180761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 14507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14507, "last_played": 1736118782}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely top shelf game.
