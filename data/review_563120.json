The game is dead for 5 years and the developer has abandoned it. Seems his account he connected the game to is heavily private and connected to an Russian account and Russian publisher who produces incomplete games connected to a Mega collection of shady games so I would not be surprised if he's a shady developer who produces very broken games to just sell. Plus it is manually put on sale, so he is actively trying to scam people with spring and summer sales, the hack. Almost a majority of the reviews are fake as well due to most of them having the early access tag connected to them, which is a common tactic to boost the rating before and after a games release.\n\nAs some people mentioned, it seems the game is using an earlier build of the game than what it should have released with. Plus several features the game was suppose to come with aren't even available such as the war room or the repair bench. Depending on what happens you could also get a crash either from raiders trying to raid your shop through a hidden influence counter and depending on either what gun you buy that require the repair bench OR if you sell guns in large qualities to groups. I've only managed to get one group to come in a buy weapons in bulk. The developer himself even tells people to just play the game and avoid the bugs through literal use of a guide on the forums ; which is stupid.\n\nDon't buy this game. Just look for another game to spend your 1.99 (0.99 since it's seems to be always on sale).", "timestamp_created": 1735619968, "timestamp_updated": 1735619968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 110, "total_negative": 80, "total_reviews": 190}, "cursors": {"AoJ4iPmYj9kCe9/ZbA==": "Mon Jan 20 19:37:39 2025"}}
