The game puts you in charge of a elite group of soldiers during World War 2 called the Commandos. Here's a brief description of each of them:\n\nThe Green Beret (Jack O'Hara) is the strongest and most resillient member of the Commandos, he is able to take down soldiers on his own without much effort using his mere strength or stealth tactics. He's equiped with several weapons, among them the most important are a Knife and a Decoy, used to lure enemy soldiers and kill them, then, he can carry their bodies to dispatch them and avoid being detected. He can also bury himself in snow to take cover. He's the fastest member of the team, tied with the Driver.\n\nThe Sniper (Francis Woolridge) is a experimented marksman who relies on his weapon of choice to slain enemies from the distance. When out of ammo for the Sniper Rifle he has to rely on the Pistol, which makes him vulnerable. He's the team Medic when the Driver is not available.\n\nThe Diver/Marine (James Blackwood) is a really multifacetic soldier that's good at melee range with his Harpoon and Knife (which in this game, he cannot throw) as well as in water, where he can survive for long periods of time thanks to his Oxygen Tank and deploy a ver convenient Inflatable Boat that can hold several allies at once. He's mostly seen in missions where travelling across water is required.\n\nThe Sapper (Thomas Hancock) is an expert in explosives, carrying Remote Bombs, Bombs, Grenades and even a Booby Trap, designed to caught distracted enemies and kill them silently. While he's the loudest of the commandos in terms of weaponry he still has a few ways to dispatch enemies rather silently. He, however, just like the Sniper, becomes quite vulnerable when out of explosives, as he has to rely on the Pistol. He's mostly seen in missions where destroying a certain building or landmark is required.\n\nThe Driver (Samuel Brooklyn) is the team vehicle expert. He is capable of driving basically every vehicle available in the game, which makes a really valuable member given most mission you'll require to grab a vehicle to either steal it or escape. He also carries a submachine gun that he can use to quickly dispatch groups of enemies. In this game (and Beyond the Call of Duty) he is as fast as the Green Beret, so he's able to do quick runaways. He is also the Team Medic for most of the game.\n\nThe Spy (Rene Duchamp) is probably the stealthiest member of the team, as well as the deadliest when unnoticed. He can disguise himself as the enemy to get through certain parts where his allies might struggle to go through or when discretion is required. When disguised he can distract enemy soldiers, giving the others a chance to run through or slain them. On top of that he carries around a vial of poison that he can use to dispatch enemies silently, and when dealt with, he can carry around their bodies to hide them in order to avoid being detected just like the Green Beret. He can drive any vehicle when he's on uniform and the Driver is not present (Only in \"Stop Wildfire\"). He's also the team Medic when neither the Sniper nor the Driver are available.\n\nNow, about the game itself, well its an unconventional strategy game where instead of managing an entire army you manage anywhere from 3 to all 6 commandos in a series of mission, ranging from slaining certain enemies, to destroying certain buildings or landmarks to just robbing a vehicle, there's a lot of variety from mission to mission and if that wasn't enough, the variety of the Commandos themselves really helps to make the game loop less repetitive. Also, most of the mission are partially based on historical events, which is really neat, so if you're a WW2 aficionado, you might want to grab this game just for that fact alone.\n\nOverall, a great game, with a good storyline and varied gameplay. However, be aware that if you want to play this game in Spanish you'll need to patch the game, since ironically, the original translation is not available on Steam.\n\nScore: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1736275066, "timestamp_updated": 1736343765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185019349": {"recommendationid": "185019349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017328002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1518196084}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo mais dif\u00edcil da sua gera\u00e7\u00e3o.

You could also shoot out the four guards and enter from the front with the sniper but this would deplete all your shots and then you wouldn't be able to take out the cannon soldier who is aiming right at the tank...getting to which is basically the point of the mission.\n\nthis is not specific to commandos pretty much every stealth game has this problem. Its a matter of designing a security system that is difficult to exploit but not impossible, if you had too many options it would not be challenging. You run into the exact same thing in thief the dark project.\n\nThe green Beret and Spy are the MC of this game. The sniper, marine and sapper are also fun when you get to use them.... the driver is useless and only serves as your tank operator often at the end of the mission. They could have cut him out of the game and had the sapper drive the tank and it wouldn't have made the difference. The drivers only other unique tools are the sub machine gun which is pretty bad and I never use it and the med kit which you wont need if you are good and is given to other characters on the missions the driver isn't in.\n\nThe game would  have benefited from a few extra grenades/sniper rounds possibly located on the map as you don't get to use these enough as they are really limited, very challenging but also robbing some of the fun and these are some of the funnest things to use in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1736228140, "timestamp_updated": 1736229101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184890863": {"recommendationid": "184890863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297770886", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1862, "last_played": 1719449170}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si vas a jugar Commandos tenes que tener en cuenta 3 cosas:\n1.
