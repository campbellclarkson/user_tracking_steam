I have so much to say about this game, it is insane.\nWell let`s begin from the fact that i hated that game when i started to play it. It was random, extremely unfair and confusing as there are little to none tutorial, so entry level is quite hard.(still is tbh). BUT! I gave it a shot and that was my best desicion.\nGame does not disappoint as game offers you truly interesting experience that would never have in any other game.\n1. Gameplay: Biggest proud of the developers of this masterpiece is gameplay, turnbased combat, RTS on the world map. You lead a band of people who will risk their life for a coin and in the world of BB they often end up dead. In this harsh, cruel world where magic exists, you are nothing more but a peasants, daytalors, nobleman, but a simple human whos task is to survive and if good enough prosper in this dark fantasy medieval world. Depending on your origin you are present with a few starting BBs with whom you will have to hire new BBs, find yourself suitable job, make money and renown. First time you play this game each battle will be life and death situation. One of the strongest aspects of the game its replay ability, as maps are randomly generated and everything on it (cities, brothers, ancient wonders, contracts and etc.) that leads to always unique walkthrough, top that with different origins that also spice game up and you have almost infinite amount of replay ability.\n2. Lore: This world have some already established story. Undead who rise are a dark magic of necromancers who found this power from ancient empire long gone and forgotten. Orcs are a bloodthirsty, man eating warmongers who raid defensless villages. Goblins, small yet lethal who use range advanrage and poison to weaken their enemies. Powerful, sometime mindblowing beasts who are after you and attack on first sigh. Last, but not least (if not the scariest) Ancient Undead who rise again to scourge this world.\n3. Music: Wonderful music created by Breakdown Epiphanies. You will be singing, humming and having that music in your head for a loooong time, it is that good. They managed to depict a faction with their music, which is no small task.\n4. Graphics: That is the aspect that might push away many players, making it even more niche than it already is. But simplicity of graphics allows players with old potato computers (me included) to enjoy magical dark fantasy world.\nIf i had to rate this game from 1 to 10, it would be 8.5~9/10. I would love to give it 10/10, but some aspects of the game are raw and undeveloped, nothing crucial, but if you replay it you would start noticing those small details.\nI hope fans and DEVs forgive me if i forgot something, game is big or to be more precise it gets bigger the more you play.", "timestamp_created": 1736003928, "timestamp_updated": 1736003928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184731177": {"recommendationid": "184731177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345988647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1236, "playtime_at_review": 8711, "last_played": 1736955788}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0430\u043d\u0441 90% \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435. \r\n\u0410 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0436 \u0441 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435)", "timestamp_created": 1735991451, "timestamp_updated": 1735991451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184727197": {"recommendationid": "184727197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033690788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9991, "last_played": 1736038539}, "language": "english", "review": "Just funny and always good", "timestamp_created": 1735987559, "timestamp_updated": 1735987559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184724726": {"recommendationid": "184724726", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985917420", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2084, "last_played": 1735996404}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1735984862, "timestamp_updated": 1735984862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184716481": {"recommendationid": "184716481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272739946", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 26784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26784, "last_played": 1735738961}, "language": "russian", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1735975544, "timestamp_updated": 1735975544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184711931": {"recommendationid": "184711931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243017776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 21608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "playtime_at_review": 21129, "last_played": 1737357147}, "language": "english", "review": "I actually like this game, so you will have 95% chance (cannot go higher than 95%) to get a positive review from me.

That's just the result of a dev team with limited resources that made all the right decisions in prioritization to dish out a phenomenally addictive title no worse than any AAA title out there. This is what you'd get if Mount & Blade and X-COM made love, but the game has more of a rogue-like feel than either of the two. The gameplay loop consists mostly of going from town to town on the strategy layer, searching for contracts/quests, buying and selling trade goods on the side and maybe hiring an extra mercenary into your band of brothers every once in a while. You have to make sure that you don't run out of money to pay your mercenary group, food to feed them, and various other supplies. Any time you get ambushed by bandits or decide to venture into a dangerous (but possibly treasure-laden) location on the map, the fight will play out in a turn-based tactical layer, which is the heart of the game. While the setting has some monsters and very minimal amounts of magic, the fights feel very down-to-earth and realistic. Relative positioning of units is highly important - units can protect each other in a shield wall, will have a hard time defending themselves if they get surrounded, and can lock down the movement of other units in their \"zone of control\". Factors like fatigue, armor and weapon type, terrain, elevation and morale play a significant role. Different types of enemies have very different tactics and require different approaches to counter them. As your mercenaries gain experience you'll be able to level them up, improving their capabilities significantly, though they'll always remain quite human and mortal. It can be really painful to lose a guy. Due to the large amount of different stats with significant randomness in both starting values and potential for improvement during level-ups (talent) as well as special traits each mercenary feels unique, like a real person. Just like the mercenaries you can hire, the world map is randomly generated for each campaign. Overall the game has great replayability with a selection of different starting conditions, but at the same time you can play any given campaign for as long as you want, with a lot of freedom to do what you want (fight in arenas, do mostly trading, rob caravans or protect them, pillage monster lairs in the wilderness, etc)", "timestamp_created": 1735599379, "timestamp_updated": 1735599414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184258839": {"recommendationid": "184258839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134256213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2181, "last_played": 1718572932}, "language": "english", "review": "Iam so OVERHYPED for the nest game", "timestamp_created": 1735594884, "timestamp_updated": 1735594884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184235357": {"recommendationid": "184235357", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993951886", "num_games_owned": 754, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 233, "playtime_at_review": 1920, "last_played": 1736283869}, "language": "english", "review": "Would love to give this game positive review, but I just lost 3 days worth of save files and I've been playing these past 3 days pretty much.

If you usually play without headphones, try playing with headphones plugged in instead.\n[*] Disable any streaming software and close all browser windows playing videos.\n[*] Reboot before starting the game.\n[/list]\n\nHope it helps!\n[/quote]\n\nThis game has been out since 2017 and they can't manage to fix an error effecting many and just resort to this tired \"Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in\" shtick.\n\nTo the devs: Once I pay you, it is your job to provide a working product; it isn't my job to trouble shoot through logs, Reddit posts, Steam posts, event viewers, firewall settings, display settings, etc.\n\nGet it through your thick skulls: Your game is not graphically intensive nor is damage calculations cpu intensive in a small turn based combat session involving 10 entities. The problem is incompetent devs that refuse to address their failures. When I can run Bannerlord with 100s of entities pushing multiple damage calculations per second in [b]realtime[/b] at the highest settings, there's something fundamentally wrong here (It's not
