It's fun, I find it therapeutic, and the turn based combat is simple enough that I don't feel the need to have to look up strategies, but deep enough that there are some tactical decisions to make. Sometimes the RNG will get you, it's generally worth saving before important battles so you can load if necessary.\n\nThe gameplay loop is fairly simple, you send your henchmen out to buy and renovate properties on the world map and cause trouble. The more 'aggressive' moves turn bigger profits, but attract the attention of the police which is also kind of like the time limit for the level - eventually the police will raid you, and you will be out of options to get out of it!\n\nIt's good fun, nothing too detailed or difficult, but nice if you're into this sort of thing.", "timestamp_created": 1737303673, "timestamp_updated": 1737303673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185874071": {"recommendationid": "185874071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024687236", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 674, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1737291863}, "language": "polish", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1737220685, "timestamp_updated": 1737220685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185803427": {"recommendationid": "185803427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198922800008", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 1383, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1172, "playtime_at_review": 1172, "last_played": 1737140806}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Kalypso oyunlar\u0131ndan 3. oynad\u0131\u011f\u0131m oyundu bu oyun.
