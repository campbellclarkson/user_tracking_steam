This revision of the game adds the base game and the two original expansions for a mere 5 dollars, which honestly feels like a steal, not in a bad way, but rather because this game, just like its prequel, has a lot to offer and a high level of replayability.\n\nRepeating myself from my RT1 review, its 2.5d graphics might be a bit archaic for today's standards but have aged fairly well and can be considered \"retro\" rather than \"dated\", specially in comparison to the 3D ones of the third installment. \nThere is a lot to do in this game and each park provides its own set of challenges that must be overcome in order to reach the desired goals, but as to how you do it, anything goes really, so you can take your sweet time to do it, even if there's a timer for it, don't stress yourself, cause this game is not meant for that but rather to relax. \n\nThis game adds what i desired the most in the first one, a Scenario Editor that, while archaic and a bit clunky to nagivate at times, it has it own charm and has a lot of functionality and customization to it, which really adds a lot of value over the first one. If you're looking for the nostalgia factor with quality of life features this installement of the franchise is for you.\n\nGo, give it a try, and if you're not convinced grab it on sale.

Want to build a massive, sprawling theme park with intricate coaster designs? Go for it. The customization options are incredible, from terrain editing to coaster building.\r\n\r\nThe Nostalgic Graphics\r\nThe pixelated, isometric visuals are iconic.

Even after all these years, it remains a classic in the genre, offering countless hours of fun as you build and manage your very own theme park. While I\u2019ve since moved on to more modern titles like Planet Coaster, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 will always be a nostalgic favorite that continues to hold up as a timeless gem.\r\n\r\nA First Step Into the World of Sim Games:\r\n\r\nRollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was my introduction to the world of simulation games, and it made a lasting impression. The game offers a perfect balance of creativity and management, allowing you to design wild roller coasters, manage park finances, and keep your guests happy\u2014all while dealing with unexpected challenges like staff problems, maintenance issues, and natural disasters. The intuitive interface and simple yet engaging gameplay made it easy to get into, and the deeper you got, the more rewarding it became.\r\n\r\nCountless Hours of Fun:\r\n\r\nThe real magic of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 lies in its replayability. Every time you start a new park, you\u2019re presented with a unique set of challenges and opportunities. The variety of park themes, coaster designs, and scenarios means no two playthroughs are ever the same. You can spend hours designing the perfect coaster, tweaking park layouts, and experimenting with different strategies to keep your guests entertained and your profits soaring. Even after completing all the scenarios, the game\u2019s sandbox mode offers endless opportunities for creative expression. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the lack of a real campaign or mission objectives means the game is primarily just a sandbox experience. If you're looking for a structured progression system or specific goals, you'll have to create your own.\r\n\r\nThe Switch to Planet Coaster:\r\n\r\nWhile I eventually moved on to newer games like Planet Coaster, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 still holds a unique charm. Planet Coaster certainly pushes the limits of coaster design and park management with its stunning graphics and intricate mechanics, but RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 has a simplicity and nostalgia that can\u2019t be replaced. The older graphics and less detailed mechanics might seem dated by today\u2019s standards, but the fun factor remains unchanged, and there\u2019s something irresistibly charming about the pixelated guests and low-poly coasters.\r\n\r\nSadly No Mods or Custom Content:\r\n\r\nOne downside to RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is the lack of official support for mods or custom content. While the game does offer a lot in terms of built-in scenarios and park design options, there\u2019s no easy way to add in your own creations or download mods from the community\u2014something that modern simulation games like Planet Coaster offer with a robust modding community. This lack of customization is a bit disappointing for players who love the idea of expanding the game with new assets, like custom rides or user-made maps.\r\n\r\nLimitation in Funds:\r\n\r\nAnother aspect that can be frustrating is the financial limitations. While you can borrow money from the bank to build your dream park, the amount you can borrow is often quite limited, making it difficult to expand or add expensive rides and attractions without running into financial trouble. This can be a bit restrictive, especially for those who want to create massive, intricate parks without constantly managing loans or worrying about going bankrupt.\r\n\r\nA Timeless Classic:\r\n\r\nRollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a true classic that set the standard for theme park simulators. While modern games have improved on the graphics and mechanics, RCT2 still holds its ground in terms of fun and creativity. Whether you're an experienced fan or someone experiencing it for the first time, there\u2019s something universally enjoyable about creating a sprawling theme park and watching it come to life.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\n\r\nAs my first PC game, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 will always be a special part of my gaming history. While I\u2019ve since moved on to more advanced simulators like Planet Coaster, this classic still brings back fond memories and continues to offer a fun, nostalgic experience. The lack of mod support, custom content, a real campaign, and the limited financial freedom can feel restrictive, but the core gameplay remains satisfying and timeless. If you're a fan of theme park simulators or just looking for a relaxing, creative game to play, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a must-try.\r\n\r\nRating: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1735510343, "timestamp_updated": 1735510343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184116063": {"recommendationid": "184116063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801790322", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 16549, "last_played": 1736216378}, "language": "english", "review": "IF I had to be on a stranded island with only one game to play for the rest of my life.
