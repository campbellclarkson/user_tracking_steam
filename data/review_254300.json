It was one of my favorite games at the time, with its turn based combat, unique worldbuilding and a vibrant 2D graphics style. To my surprise, not only is the game still alive, but it recently got ported to Unity. I hope there's a chance it can return to Steam one day.", "timestamp_created": 1735170864, "timestamp_updated": 1735170864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 409, "total_negative": 143, "total_reviews": 552}, "cursors": {"AoJw/8yR0usCcsLaxgE=": "Mon Jan 20 17:12:18 2025"}}
