The game is very simple, with easy mechanics, beautiful scenery and simple graphics \u2014 [i]in my honest opinion[/i], they aren\u2019t ugly, considering when it was first released. You can play both in solo mode and JxJ mode, which doubles the fun.\n\nI have nothing but good memories of this game. My father was very into it when I was younger and taught me some tactics. Sadly, I have forgotten most of them, but the [i]nostalgia[/i] is still very ingrained in my heart. It is very sad to see that the game has since pretty much died. I pray that more people give it a chance. In summary, I adore it very much due to nostalgia, as mentioned before. The game is old\uff0dfashioned and cheap, I admit, but if you enjoy these types of RTS games and can grab a good promotion, it may be fun for you too.\n\n[b]Do not invade Russia in the winter.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1736812425, "timestamp_updated": 1736812425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184338981": {"recommendationid": "184338981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096674580", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1735690761}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u8d28\u4e0d\u597d\uff0c\u641e\u4e0d\u61c2\u5728\u5e72\u4ec0\u4e48\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1735659501, "timestamp_updated": 1735659501, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184301309": {"recommendationid": "184301309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082348073", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1735631598}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ae5\u5e74\u554a\u5367\u69fd \u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u7238\u4e70\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5149\u76d8\n\u6211\u4e5f\u641e\u4e0d\u61c2\u4e0a\u9762\u90a3\u51e0\u4e2a\u5dee\u8bc4\u7684\u5565\u610f\u601d\n\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u554a \u5f53\u7136\u8fd9\u70b9\u5355\u8bcd\u8fd8\u662f\u80fd\u61c2\u5f97", "timestamp_created": 1735629979, "timestamp_updated": 1735629979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 365, "total_negative": 197, "total_reviews": 562}, "cursors": {"AoJ4wNmV0PQCfKjDogI=": "Mon Jan 20 17:12:17 2025"}}
