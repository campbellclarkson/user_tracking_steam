hand-drawn sprites (instead of 3D) and some quality-of-life limitations with quests, inventory, and fast-travel.  (And they're no [i]worse[/i] than Fallout 1/2 were.)\n\nThis is almost a one-man project and the amount of content in here is fantastic - on par with MGS:V and AssCreed:Oddysey.\nThe [b]worldbuilding is great[/b].\nThe combat is good.\nThe inventory management is... not great.  It could definitely do with things like \"sort by weight\".  At least it's hard to accidentally lose a quest-only item.\nThe [b]quest management is inadequate[/b] by modern standards.  You will repeatedly say \"WTF am I supposed to do now?\"  You will need to read the wiki or pay close attention to one-time quest-giver dialogue, because the quest screen won't always give explicit directions.  It is *very* easy to find the quest item in a locker and not realize it, because the quest screen doesn't update with \"you've got X, now take it back to NPC Y\".  It only has \"todo: X for NPC Y\" and \"done: you got X for NPC Y\".\n(It has an excellent wiki, which is enough to get you out of most jams.)\nThe auto-map is a big help except in big cities.  SGS has per-floor maps, but Core City and University don't.\nYou cannot fast-travel to or from arbitrary places (a la Morrowind COC command), instead you must walk to a fast-travel point (e.g. a station) and then travel to another point on the same travel network.  Combined with the poor quest stages, this can make backtracking frustrating, but it's not a show-stopper (a la Morrowind without console commands).\nThere are a couple of quests where you can lock yourself into an undesirable questline without realizing it.  In particular, [spoiler]negotiating a moderate solution to the Train Heist locks you into the police genocide path for police-vs-slaves[/spoiler].\n\nOh, also, anything that improves your movement speed (tabi boots, faster DLC jetski) is worth having just for faster backtracking / non-fast travel.  You can also improve effective speed by changing run time (Ctrl+MouseUp) and zooming out (Shift+MouseDown, disabled in options menu by default).\n\nI avoided buying this game for a long time because I expected to bounce off the old-style graphics. After a couple of hours I didn't notice that at all.\nI think Encased has better graphics, and Atom RPG / Trudograd has better Slav bleakness, but UnderRail is better at most everything else.  Play all three!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/921800/Encased_A_SciFi_PostApocalyptic_RPG/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/552620/ATOM_RPG_Postapocalyptic_indie_game/\n\nPS: you can become a Cave Jedi about five minutes into the game (or anytime after that) by taking a magic pill.  I never actually tried this.  There are a couple of enemies that can only be hurt by Jedi, but you can run/sneak around them with a little save-scumming.  I feel like the \"be a Cave Jedi?\" option would have worked better either during character creation, or (as in KOTOR) teased until the end of Act I (when you [spoiler]clear the rail lines with the Junkyard MacGuffin[/spoiler]).\n\nAlso initial game start is a little slow, but quickload is very fast, which is a good trade-off.", "timestamp_created": 1737255403, "timestamp_updated": 1737255837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458049595355987549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185883994": {"recommendationid": "185883994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093002901", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1730325230}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey, Hey, People", "timestamp_created": 1737228939, "timestamp_updated": 1737228939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458049595355987549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185819866": {"recommendationid": "185819866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048609482", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3055, "playtime_at_review": 3270, "last_played": 1737403204}, "language": "czech", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1737159600, "timestamp_updated": 1737159600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185764934": {"recommendationid": "185764934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995286548", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1535, "playtime_at_review": 2027, "last_played": 1737332456}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately I have to give it a Negative but its honestly more of a middle thumb.\n\nThe first time I played it I struggled with a Gun build and didn't make it far. The second time I tried to play it I liked it at first but it hit a point when a new faction emerges where the difficulty became frustrating rather than satisfying. I was playing on Easy mode. Weapons and traps and things were not doing any damage, since your character is alone you get overwhelmed. People online say to use traps and grenades and things but it felt like I was save scumming every fight multiple times to get any positive result and my inventory was loaded up with traps and grenades. My build was based on stealth and throwing weapons so maybe the problem was I was meant to sneak past everything which is fine and fair but that gets boring after a while. I was up against enemies that resisted mechanical damage which was the only type of damage I could do besides molotov cocktails and gas grenades which required several minutes of setup and if you set it up wrong you constantly save scum. It is very likely I just don't have the patience for a game like this anymore. I think people who like very tactical games would love this as you have a lot of options and replay ability would be fun, as I was playing it I wondered what it would have been like to be a heavy armour hammer character with psi powers.\n\nStory wise it seemed interesting and drip fed story and lore to you bit at a time to keep you interested. Unfortunately I wasn't good or patient enough to see where it went. Looks like you have multiple choices of who to have allegiances to. \n\nI hope the next game has a true \"easy\" difficulty for people like me who want to experience the story and game but don't have time to really get into the mechanics to the degree that the game expects of you. There is a really great game here but the difficulty and patience style game play wasn't for me.

Restarted a few times in the early stages of the game, but am ultimately over it after reaching level 18 and spending most of the time exploring.\nStill don't feel like I've made much progress, despite this, given the expansive scope of the game.\nUnless you're a die-hard Fallout 1/2 fan, it really isn't worth getting into.\n\n-----\nCons\n-----\nMeta save scumming simulator. You will likely spend 60% of the game save scumming.\n\nThe game is an unforgiving time sink.\nPower build or die. Either spend a bunch of time deciding which build to use specifically beforehand by looking up existing builds online, or don't play at all.\nMisplaced a skill point or perk? Too bad. Reload or start an entirely new game.\n\nYou can look forward to investing an hour into damn near every battle - save scumming like you have nothing better to play.\n\nYou'll be micro managing every little thing with no backup or party mechanics whatsoever. The fact that you are sent out to deal with absolutely everything on your own is utter, laughable bollocks.\n\nYou'll be spamming a lot of grenades (and save scumming when you miss).\nUnless your build allows you to put points into the Throwing skill, you'll be lobbing them 20 meters in the damn-near opposite direction as if you have cerebral palsy.\n\nThe inventory system is a pain in the ass.\nManaging item weight is a massive hindrance. Given the scope of the areas to traverse, and lack of meaningful fast travel aside from boats, you'll be spending half of the game encumbered while you ferry loot around.\n\nMost of the loot you'll find is garbage that you won't be able to use unless your build makes use of the crafting skills.\n\nThe traders are anal-retentive with regards to what they will or will not purchase from you, and how many of those desired items you can actually sell. It renders most of that loot-ferrying and hoarding as meaningless. I understand the need to limit the player's purchasing power so as to keep economy relevant, but you don't have a lot of good purchase options anyway.\n\nUnless you've played before and know where everything is and exactly what you're doing, or you're following a walkthrough (lame), you'll have to spend probably 100+ hours to get anywhere meaningful in the game.\n\nThe old-school isometric style of the game, as nostalgic as it is, can make navigation and clicking on things a hassle unless you're holding tab like 60% of the time.\n\nYou can't speed up the game while even lightly encumbered. Gotta keep the player moving at a snails' pace to boost them play time numbers.\n\nThe initiative system is stupid. If you are in stealth mode, and attack an enemy despite not having been spotted at all on approach, there's every likelihood that your attack is nixed and they get their turns first (more opportunities for save scumming, yay!).  You can't use burst/automatic gunfire from out of stealth, either.\n\nThe quests are boring.\n\nThe game is, ultimately, boring.\n\n-----\nPros\n-----\nExtensive campaign\nLots of hand-placed detail\nThe dialogue is decent\nIn-depth item crafting system\nLots of items\nLots of build options\nSomewhat modernized old-school isometric style", "timestamp_created": 1736962509, "timestamp_updated": 1736984748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523363649845123291", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185598478": {"recommendationid": "185598478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262327890", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 2267, "last_played": 1736882506}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u041f\u0413 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043a\u0438\n\n\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b:\n\n- \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\n- \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 - \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438, \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0442\n- \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0443 (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438)\n- \u0420\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\n- \u0412\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430\n\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n\n- \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\n- \u0418\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 - \u0411\u0435\u0437 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0432.\n\n\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438:\n\n- \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438, \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0445 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0430, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430.\n\n\u0412 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435 - \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e. \u0414\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0451\u0442, \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1736882757, "timestamp_updated": 1736886677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185594501": {"recommendationid": "185594501", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026456425", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1728145911}, "language": "english", "review": "\nUnderrail is a fantastic, old-school RPG that truly nails the classic isometric design and tactical combat.

more. I have completed the main story and Expedition, while Heavy Duty is saved for another time, partly because I was really invested in the main story and wanted to see the ending.\n\nSo, I can't help but sing praises to this game as it is a marvel and a breath of fresh air. Narratively, it is amazing. It presents a very interesting world and likable characters while at the same time never drowning in pointless text. It all feels very real and believable, like in a sense, it is something you can picture and somethig you can enjoy without any dissoance. No ass pulls, no characters staying stupid crap or wasting air while patronizing the player. The writing is light, very smooth and a complete joy to read. It doesn't waste time and has no pointless dialogue. When I jumped into it I was completely hooked on and kept playing for days. It is one of those games where it is [i]fun[/i] to read item descriptions and computer messages. They story these bits of lore build syncs beautifully.\n\nI also HAVE to mention the atmosphere, as it is probably the most atmospheric game I've played in a long time. There were precise moments when background music, dialogue and visuals all created an amazing episodes when you can just see your character in this world, plotting and doing things. Mine was when [spoiler] I was talking with Blaine about Junkyard [/spoiler]. The music is just done right and hits amazingly well in certain moments. There is just so much soul here. I can't praise Stygs enough for this, even though [spoiler]the ending is very anticlimatic and raises more questions than it gives you answers [/spoiler].\n\nCombat system is pretty straight forward and quick to get a hang of, despite initially looking complicated. A build is [i]really[/i] recommended for a better experience. There is some space to wiggle, but it is best to know what you are getting. You'll have to choose your combat playstyle and won't be able to effectively use every weapon.\n\nIt has some replayability value for some, but be advised, you can sink days here.", "timestamp_created": 1735756119, "timestamp_updated": 1735932672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452255040407180786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184344093": {"recommendationid": "184344093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259446899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 4593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 394, "playtime_at_review": 1520, "last_played": 1736396884}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive game if you were into Fallout 1/2 and Jagged Alliance 1/2.

My first go through my character couldn't get past the first difficult section and I had to restart. If you don't enjoy difficult games that border on completely unfair at times this might not be for you. However, if you can push through the initial difficulty and learn the games mechanics you'll get to experience one of best RPGs I've ever played. Also the 1st DLC is more of a expansion that adds A LOT of really fun stuff and a engaging story that left me thinking about what I actually did for long time after playing.

Every decision counts, and the game doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re ready for it \u2013 it just throws you in the deep end.\r\n\r\nThe combat? Chef\u2019s kiss \u2013 turn-based, but the enemies are relentless and won\u2019t hesitate to wreck you. You gotta think 3 steps ahead, or you\u2019re done. And the skill system is so deep it\u2019s like drowning in options, but once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s sick. You\u2019re basically building your character for the apocalypse.\r\n\r\nStory\u2019s kinda wild too, lots of factions, moral choices, and weird stuff happening in the tunnels.
