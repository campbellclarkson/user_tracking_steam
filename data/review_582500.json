No es ya que sea el primero y pueda tener fallitos, es que es un completo sinsentido. \n\nTiene m\u00faltiples bugs a la hora de pulsar palancas y piezas en el ajedrez. Luego en el puzle del ajedrez no te puedes morir y reintentarlo y te llevas todo el rato con la pantalla cubierta de nieve y sin ver nada. \n\nM\u00e1s adelante hay otro puzle de encontrar un camino en un libro, el cual est\u00e1 mal redactado, intenta ser \u201ccr\u00edptico y po\u00e9tico\u201d pero realmente est\u00e1 mal redactado. Los puntos de t\u00e9rmino de frase no est\u00e1n donde deben y las frases est\u00e1n mal puestas, intentando ser m\u00e1s desafiante su lectura, pero resulta agotador descifrar algo aleatorio.\n\nEn el siguiente puzle (donde lo dejamos) te presenta un teatro y no te explica absolutamente nada. No sabes cuando es el tope de las manivelas, ni lo que est\u00e1s moviendo sin que te lo diga tu otro compa\u00f1ero, adem\u00e1s de tampoco sabes que hace la palanca de escena ni de luces (l\u00f3gicamente uno servir\u00e1 para las luces y el otro para validar la escena si es correcta, pero cuando le das hacen cosas raras y reinicia a veces el puzle, otras veces no, etc). Adem\u00e1s, los cartones de las escenas, cambian y no hay imputs sonoros suficientes ni visuales para saber cuando es correcto, cuando no, cuanto te queda de la escena, cuantas escenas hay, etc).\n\nEs un absoluto desprop\u00f3sito este juego, por algo est\u00e1 gratis. Lo que no entiendo es la cantidad de rese\u00f1as positivas, supongo que ser\u00e1n positivas porque no han pagado por el juego.\n\nSi quer\u00e9is jugar algo de este tipo puzle- cooperativo de la misma empresa os recomiendo el Forever o el Expeditions (el \u201cToo\u201d no llega al nivel del 1 en cuanto a mal nivel, pero tambi\u00e9n es malo y tiene muchos bugs).\n\n\nNota: 3 /10                                                                   Valoraci\u00f3n: No Recomendado\n", "timestamp_created": 1736892731, "timestamp_updated": 1736892731, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185603035": {"recommendationid": "185603035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036801525", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1736890368}, "language": "english", "review": "i left my friend behind very nice", "timestamp_created": 1736887583, "timestamp_updated": 1736887583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185602399": {"recommendationid": "185602399", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217546897", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1736886743}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interactive and fun, definitely needs people who can communicate properly lol!\nLess than medium difficulty, could take 1 -
