Von Anfang an l\u00e4uft alles sehr fl\u00fcssig, und erst in den sp\u00e4teren Zeitaltern kann es auf wirklich gro\u00dfen Karten ein wenig dauern, bis die KI ihre Z\u00fcge berechnet hat. Das finde ich jedoch gut verschmerzbar, weil das Spiel dann auch richtig an Komplexit\u00e4t gewinnt.\r\n\r\nDie Grafik empfinde ich keineswegs als altbacken. Sie ist zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig und gleichzeitig h\u00fcbsch genug, um auch nach vielen Spielstunden nicht zu langweilen. Au\u00dferdem haben die unterschiedlichen Anf\u00fchrer jeweils ihren eigenen Stil, was immer wieder f\u00fcr frische Strategien sorgt. Ich lerne selbst nach der x-ten Partie noch neue Kniffe dazu \u2013 und genau das macht auch nach \u00fcber 100 Runden unheimlich viel Spa\u00df.\r\n\r\n\u201eCiv\u201c ist und bleibt f\u00fcr mich ein grandioses Strategieerlebnis: Aufbauen, Expandieren, Diplomatie f\u00fchren oder Krieg anzetteln \u2013 die M\u00f6glichkeiten sind riesig. Auch die Achievements motivieren mich, neue Taktiken auszuprobieren, ohne dabei frustrierend schwierig zu sein.\r\n\r\nDer einzige Negativpunkt, den ich habe, sind die zahlreichen DLCs, die in der Summe recht kostspielig werden k\u00f6nnen. Mein Tipp: einfach auf einen Sale warten, dann bekommt man alles zu einem viel faireren Preis.\r\n\r\nWer Rundentaktik liebt, kann mit Civilization V auch nach all den Jahren nichts falsch machen.

Huge soundtrack library tailored to war and peace times, and to the particular civs. Cities are carefully generated around terrain, reflect their size, have architecture particular to civs, and physically render wonders you build. 1000 hours later, I still get a kick out of zooming in on my cities to see them thriving. Not to mention that even at max settings, just about any computer made within the last 10 years should handle it just fine. \n\n2) The learning curve. Every new game is incredibly easy to pick up.

It's a turn-based strategy game where you guide a civilization from the dawn of time to the modern age, and no two games ever feel quite the same. Whether you're building wonders, waging wars, or making allies, there's always something to keep you engaged.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is super satisfying, especially with the way the hex-based maps and combat work. It makes planning out your moves and strategy feel rewarding, whether you're expanding your empire or just trying to survive a surprise war. The expansions like Gods & Kings and Brave New World made the game even better, adding religion, trade, and diplomacy systems that gave it more depth.\r\n\r\nThat said, I never managed to unlock all the achievements, even after playing a ton.

From the perspective of somebody whose been playing both pretty diligently recently and have watched plenty of video's on the matter, I must say that in terms of the un-modded game play, Civ V is going to be a lot easier to understand mechanics and strategy wise than Civ VI, however it still has plenty of depth and is more aesthetically pleasing imo; however, Civ VI increased complexity and ability to make achieving other victory conditions like religious and cultural more plausible/competitive (I found Civ V was heavily geared towards the scientific victory) is what makes it stand out for me. So, if you don't plan on modding the game, I recommend Civ V just because the trade off for more complex game play with Civ VI does not outweigh the lack of quality in comparison to it's predecessor (although it's not a major difference, but some things in the newer game might bother you or be too confusing in the beginning). As for which game to choose if you plan on modding it, i'd have to go with Civ VI. After playing the game for a bit, I found a mod pack someone created (it was in the popular section and included all the \"juicy\" mechanic's based and visual mods I wanted), and it just transformed the game by adding more natural and artificial wonders, better water effects, denser vegetation, enhanced tile \"biomes\", etc. It literally made the game into another Civ VII.

In the text box for beta access, enter in \"ineedlegacyaccess\" without the \"s, hit Check Code. You'll receive confirmation.\n\nAfter doing that, verify the game files. Then go to your Steam settings, find Downloads tab, and hit Clear Download Cache. Steam will restart, if it doesn't, relaunch manually. Then go to CIV 5 in your library, click play, launch DX10/11 version. It should then start running.\n\nThis may not work for everyone, you may need to even reinstall the game first. I'm not 100% certain, but this is what has worked for me.\n\nBest of luck and God bless.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--Original Review--\nAfter a long hiatus from Civ V, I got back into the game last month and began having a blast. Unfortunately, right around before the new year, I was unable to launch the game. Stuck updating the executable out of nowhere. I had tried nearly everything. Verifying, clearing cache, reinstalling fresh, and so much more. Even on two different operating systems (W10, W11) and yet I have been unable to resume playing the game.\n\nWhat's sad is, I had encountered it multiple times, sometimes I was able to fix it, and resume my game, but then on the same day, it would resume being broken. Other issues I have encountered included the game just straight up not wanting to reach the main menu after launch, only for then, upon fixing that, to resume encountering the updating executable issue. At this point though. I have entered the new year defeated, unable to play the game.\n\nI'm pissed, and disappointed to say the least. Civ V was my only and favorite game in the series, with many hours and memories, and while I have contemplated purchasing Civ VI, not only do I feel completely turned off by the graphics, the UI, and some... suspicious design choices, I personally believe they do not deserve any bit of money, or statistics. For this is unacceptable. It feels like I, along with many other fans of Civ V got the middle finger from 2K.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would give a pass, as legitimate issues can happen with games, but given the state of video games in the past few years, and the horrible, disgusting, and greedy business practices that companies and corporations make, I feel though as if this was intentional.\n\nShould Civ V actually get fixed. I will gladly resume playing it, otherwise.

However, my current PC does not have a disc drive and i haven't had a PC with a native disc drive in years. And apparently at some point in the last 12 months 2K and Firaxis realized that Civ6 isn't the cash cow it used to be and Civ7 isn't getting the community welcome they had hoped. So they decided to kill Civ5 in the hopes that it would force us to move over to the newer civ games that make them more money. \n\nThey did this by \"Updating\" the game to remove the third party launcher that was historically used to pick if you wanted DirectX9 or DirectX11 (Bad Graphics vs Good Graphics). However, this just so happened to include a bug where when you now select one of those in the Steam pop up the game simply shuts itself off. It never launches, you never get a loading screen, you don't even get a crash/error report. The game simply accepts that you selected one of the two options and then closes. It doesn't matter what one you select it happens with both 100% of the time. \n\nThis is even more frustrating because at the start of the year before they released this \"update\" i was playing no problem with several friends. I used the old launcher and selected my graphics and loaded it without issue. Now i suddenly can't run a game that is over a decade old? \n\ndon't waste your money on this, 2k and Firaxis killed their magnum opis so that they could force you to buy a shallow watered down version for more money with cosmetic skin packs in a few months while preventing you from playing the civs you bought and paid for.

There\u2019s no single \u201cright way\u201d to play, which makes every game feel unique.\r\n\r\nThe turn-based system ensures you have time to think through your moves, while the depth of its mechanics keeps you constantly engaged. You\u2019re always weighing risk and reward, adjusting to new threats, or capitalizing on unexpected opportunities. It\u2019s a game that rewards both careful planning and the ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nPerfect Alone or With Friends:\r\n\r\nCivilization V shines equally in single-player and multiplayer. Playing alone lets you immerse yourself in long, sprawling campaigns, facing off against AI leaders with distinct personalities and playstyles. It\u2019s the perfect game for those quiet evenings when you just want to lose yourself in strategy.\r\n\r\nBut multiplayer adds an entirely different layer of fun. Competing (or cooperating) with friends introduces new levels of tension, mind games, and hilarity. Watching alliances form and crumble, racing to a victory condition, or simply trash-talking over the mic makes for unforgettable gaming moments. Few things are as satisfying as outmaneuvering a friend to claim a cultural or military victory\u2014or the chaos of realizing you\u2019ve been double-crossed.\r\n\r\nEndless Replayability:\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons Civ 5 remains so addictive after all these years is its replayability. Each map feels fresh, thanks to the random map generator, diverse starting locations, and the wide array of civilizations to choose from. Whether you\u2019re playing as the science-focused Korea, the militaristic Zulu, or the cultural powerhouse France, each civ has unique traits and units that make every game feel different.\r\n\r\nAdd to that the expansions (Gods & Kings and Brave New World), which introduce religion, espionage, trade routes, and even more victory conditions, and the possibilities become nearly endless.\r\n\r\nA Timeless Classic:\r\n\r\nThe visuals, while not cutting-edge anymore, still hold up beautifully. The hexagonal tiles give the game a clean, modern look, and the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Meanwhile, the music and leader screens bring each civilization to life, immersing you in the world-building of the game.\r\n\r\nEven after more than a decade, Civ 5 feels as fun, polished, and rewarding as ever. It\u2019s a testament to the game\u2019s brilliant design that no matter how many hours you\u2019ve played, you\u2019re still discovering new strategies and approaches.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\n\r\nSid Meier\u2019s Civilization V isn\u2019t just a game\u2014it\u2019s a lifelong obsession. Its depth, complexity, and endless replayability make it a true masterpiece of the strategy genre. Whether you\u2019re a solo player who loves crafting the perfect empire or a fan of competitive multiplayer with friends, Civ 5 has something for everyone.\r\n\r\nAfter 11 years, it\u2019s still my go-to game and likely always will be. If you haven\u2019t experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and start your first campaign. Just be prepared to lose track of time\u2014just one more turn is real, and it\u2019s glorious.\r\n\r\nRating: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1735509590, "timestamp_updated": 1735509590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184156638": {"recommendationid": "184156638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044973957", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 872, "playtime_at_review": 6502, "last_played": 1736904458}, "language": "english", "review": "Fix the fucking game", "timestamp_created": 1735508449, "timestamp_updated": 1735508449, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184154818": {"recommendationid": "184154818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161208158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 17523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17102, "last_played": 1735615632}, "language": "english", "review": "great balance and game mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1735507164, "timestamp_updated": 1735507164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184152464": {"recommendationid": "184152464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198429930416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16521, "last_played": 1735794264}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game but I don't recommend that anyone buy it until Steam fixes the problem that prevents it from launching", "timestamp_created": 1735505503, "timestamp_updated": 1735505503, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750652551651000977", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184151337": {"recommendationid": "184151337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055461416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1299029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8934, "playtime_at_review": 1281611, "last_played": 1737246516}, "language": "english", "review": "vRIOU CHALLANGE MODES'", "timestamp_created": 1735504739, "timestamp_updated": 1735504739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184150349": {"recommendationid": "184150349", "author": {"steamid": "76561199564843828", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1736094352}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm obsessed with this game!

"review": "basically one of the best (non-existent) board games ever made for computers (and consoles). Multiplayer requires a time commitment, as its too hard to stop once you're going and while it does allow for up to like 12 people to play online, it also allows for people to play hot seat, and share the computer.\n\nThe Civilization Series ebbs and flows with complexity but at its core is a hyper accessible civilization board game that takes you through the ages of human advancement. Choosing a leader at the start is actually choosing a slightly cartoonified representation of this 2000+ year old civilization, even allowing you to take now extinct or absorbed civilizations into the 21st century, like Shoshone Natives, Babylonians, Aztecs, or the Roman Empire. Each civ choice has a set of benefits, exclusive equipment, and or military units, each useful for a specific era of gameplay, however, just because you started high on the leaderboard means you'll win, nor does starting low mean you'll lose and the general shared technology paths keep everyone balanced by their own choices/necessities.\n\nGeneral gameplay involves establishing a capitol city, and fueling it with resources that either provide happiness. culture, faith, science, or production, as well as protecting it from other civilazations or in the early game, barbarians. To do so, you'll need to choose productions in your city, deciding between new units or the more score increasing/skill enabling city building/upgrades, from defensive walls to the city library, each feeding into one of four strategies of winning/staying alive: Culture, Science, Faith, or Dominence. Winning by culture involves having your civ be too valuable a historic or otherwise significant society, science by being the smartest, faith by creating a religion and spreading your own faith through the world, and dominance through military might and physical control. Don't forget gold/money, as a civ that is losing money is also losing happiness, and a resource to buy units or improvements instantly for the next turn.\n\nEach turn lets you move or place units through the world, exploring the map or preparing for war with another civ, or moving new settlers to establish a new city/workers to build improvements and harness resources around your land. You can also choose scientific research to persue and productions to undertake to add to your units or resources, each requiring an amount of turns to fully access.\n\nEven without DlC it will take lots of your time and be very fun, not to mention very good with friends--each Civ game kinda sucks when playing online (they all desync ALL THE TIME, meaning you see a loading screen often as the game resets). Civ 5 has that problem but desyncs tend to resolve within seconds, making them not too hard to deal with until you get deep into a session (about 2-3 hours in, save, have everyone quit, and then restart the game.) But even while playing alone, theres lots of fun to be had here and on virtually any device.", "timestamp_created": 1735094166, "timestamp_updated": 1735094166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183612170": {"recommendationid": "183612170", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029546885", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1735068060}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun civ, probably the best.", "timestamp_created": 1735090106, "timestamp_updated": 1735090106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512987017631530762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183608611": {"recommendationid": "183608611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331823230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8759, "last_played": 1735393361}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Can't launch", "timestamp_created": 1735085382, "timestamp_updated": 1735085382, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183607863": {"recommendationid": "183607863", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995793440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 14839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14726, "last_played": 1735418830}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine patching and breaking a game thats over a decade fucking old and your entire first page+ on the discussion is people not getting the game to launch and NOT FIXING IT.", "timestamp_created": 1735084520, "timestamp_updated": 1735084520, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541518092155456543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183606295": {"recommendationid": "183606295", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089681548", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 5503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5503, "last_played": 1735086597}, "language": "english", "review": "After the updates the game won't start and no solution works!\nIt's almost certainly to force them to buy the big, shitty Civilization 6 and beyond, how dare they still play Civilization 5 in modern times when we have better alternatives...
