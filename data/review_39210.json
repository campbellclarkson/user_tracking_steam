This happens because I truly want to fall in love, like I did with XI... and I just cant find it. As frustrating as it was to require a group after lv10, I think this has gone too far the other way. I made it to the quest obtained paladin gear without any social interaction besides the drop in fights, where besides being alongside other players there was no convo. I'm sure if I do my due diligence I could find a group to play with and that would change my opinion, but I just don't feel the attachment that I did to my ol' avatar. I also know the old graphics for XI weren't groundbreaking, but I remember one of our arguments being the \"adult\" graphics vs the largest MMO of the time (maybe still lol) for them to go ultra cartoony here. That said, it is a beautiful world and the character art is clean just much more like other MMO titles that we were \"competing\" with back in XI.

Dawntrail sucked, it had some ok moments... nothing that would really redeem it for me tho aside from the one bunny that i will not name but those who have played will know\n\ncontent post DT has been solely hardcore content, if youre into that, cool, im not... ive ran out of content ages ago and the devs dont really seem to plan on making it better... no relic to farm, no content to grind, just hardcore content and casual story stuff cause fuck midcore players\n\nPvP can suck sometimes, not always, personally love it, but a lot of people complain about it more than the amount of people that like it so ill put it here anyways\n\n\n\nconclusion: YES PLAY IT ITS GOOD... Dawntrail doesnt exist please ignore it and just consider it as a \"graphics update\" Shadowbringers is my personal favorite, seconded by Heavensward, Endwalker was a great way to close the book on that chapter and Stormblood has... stuff... i cant say in a non spoiler review... but trust its good enough too especially compared to Dawntrail", "timestamp_created": 1737228074, "timestamp_updated": 1737228074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185879876": {"recommendationid": "185879876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963365886", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2723, "deck_playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1692779199}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has taught me that I\u2019ve outgrown MMOs.

While I do like some Final Fantasy games, it's far from my favorite JRPG series. So what made me like FF14 so much to the point of having almost 1000 hours logged?\n\nAdmittedly at first in Realm Reborn I was still hesitant. It still had the typical MMORPG tropes of having to do way too many boring fetch quests just to reach the next actual interesting plot thread and maps that are way too big to accommodate for online players. However, unlike many people who imo hate on ARR too much, I actually thought that story was... fine. Not amazing but presentable and interesting enough to get you into the world and major characters. There was perhaps a bit too much exposition, but I liked the world enough to push on through, though it helped (at first) I had friends to get through the Main Story Quests.\n\nLike many though, once I got to the very end of A Realm Reborn going into Heavensward, was when the story REALLY hooked me. The writing staff clearly changed or upgraded here and it shows. In addition to the solid worldbuilding of ARR, they just do a much better job making you care about the characters through emotional plot twists. While the story isn't as consistent as I'd like due to the nature of it being an MMO, it's still leagues better than any MMORPG story I've tried, even ones like Star Wars: The Old Republic where they prioritize story first.\n\nI quite like Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers, and Endwalker for different reasons. They have very different themes, settings, and characters but somehow make things coherent. Having a handful of likable side characters stick with you through each expansion helped things a lot compared to ARR where it felt like you were by yourself way too often. I have my nitpicks on each expansion individually, but I liked the character development both of the recurring cast and also the cast and world specific to each expansion story.\n\nBut ultimately, it's the gameplay that made me really come back. In theory, it's your typical hotkey MMORPG, BUT it's the gameplay style and the many quality of life features that make it stick out. I think the dungeons with just 4 people are as addicting as the first few. The fact that it's structured for level scaling, has a flow of puzzles, bosses, and mobs that can be quirky but memorable to fight makes every dungeon, boss, and raid very fun to do. The fact you can job/class change ON THE SAME CHARACTER is something MMORPGs have needed to do forever, and thank god FF14 is one of the few that does.\n\nThe battle system has a very strict number of tanks, DPS, and healers for each duty, and I think that makes things an overall net positive. Sure, people can't be as creative with comps outside customized duties, but with the randomized duty system, it's good to streamline things. What helps is that at least for the main game, the classes feel relatively balanced, so you can pick up any class you want for general PvE and can win (unlike what I hear of World of Warcraft where people get exceptionally stingy on picking high tier or above classes).\n\nSpeaking of community, at least when I played for several years, it was one of the better ones I've seen from an online game, especially compared to WoW and League. When you can party wipe/die at bosses and generally people will be patient and explain mechanics to you patiently and NOT flame you (outside some exceptions) shows this game has the \"for everyone\" vibe that many game companies try for but fail at.\n\nNow sadly, while I like FF14 quite a bit, it just has too many flaws for me to consider it one of my all-time favorite games and stories, unlike many people.\n\nWhile the story is very good, the structure of the game being an MMO REALLY kills the pacing a lot of the time. Even in Heavensward and above, the fact you still have to do boring ass fetch quests and traverse boringly big maps just to get to the next interesting plot beat or dungeon/boss is super boring.\n\nWhat doesn't help is that in Heavensward and after, you need to find certain \"waypoints\" to be able to fly on each map. This is a super big pain in the ass with how big maps can get. I much prefer the linear way of unlocking flying in ARR... just by progressing the main story naturally.\n\nI also have nitpicks about the story of each expansion. As said earlier, ARR is mostly exposition dumping which can be very dull to get through. Heavensward has uncomfortable human/dragon romance. The Ala Mhigo half of Stormblood's story felt underbaked, which sucks since the Doma half is one of my favorites in the series. Shadowbringers being an isekai only barely relevant to the main story for 95% of its runtime hurts it a lot. Endwalker bringing in time travel to the main plot made me take it much less seriously.\n\nAnd while FF14 is still the best executed of general modern MMORPG gameplay... I still in general do NOT like the MMORPG loop of traversing needlessly big maps, doing fetch quests for characters I don't care about, having to cycle a bazillion abilities at a time which makes controller gameplay way too hard, requiring to play with other people to advance the story, etc.\n\nThankfully, I still overall quite like FF14, and I still consider it a miracle I even legit like a modern MMORPG and mainline Final Fantasy since both have been disappointing for quite a long time. Gotta thank mah boi the director Yoshi-P for having the healthy mindset of letting people take a break when they need to and not doing the stupid AAA company thing of thinking of dumb shallow pandering ways to force people to keep playing for money.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1737041491, "timestamp_updated": 1737041491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I took a huge break however around 2017, and didn't come back till late 2023 to where my view of it went from enjoyable to not. I have over 3000 hours on steam and a good bit of time on console on top of that, but upon coming back I've realized the community went from great to complete garbage. This was on Goblin by the way. All the game is now is a 2nd life sim apparently and just trauma dumping.\n\nNever have I once had any problems with anyone from 2010-2017, but heaven forbid once I came back in late 2023, all I ran into were people that weren't really in it to play as they were other things. I spent half a year trying to find a good FC and people to play the game with, but I would always end up in some FC that did nothing but use plugins like mare and just want to ERP or suck at each others face all day. Basically, got tricked into joining every single one, then find out a month or two later why they really play. Like this is fine and all, but some of us don't want to be dragged into that. Pretty sad some of them do this to pull people in by lying, to find out they don't do any of the content they said they did that you were looking for.\n\nThat's another thing, you don't have mare? Most won't bother talking to you. You don't have or want to use discord? Good luck trying to get anyone to chat in FC chat, and they always wondered why people left when only a few of us even attempted at communicating within the game. Like I get using discord VC for dungeons and events etc, but come on, the in game chat is there for a reason and you all wonder why people keep leaving when all they hear are crickets because your clique is all that matters. Never was this as big of an issue when TS, Vent, ICQ, AIM, and skype etc were a thing, everyone talked to each other, but discords just basically mandatory now. You do have mare though? Don't share your code with just anyone otherwise you'll regret it.\n\nThen you got so many stalkers and creeps that'll constantly sexually harass you, and before DT improved the blacklisting this was annoying to deal with, and even after DT it still wasn't perfect since half the time you'd think they were decent folks till you shared discord details just to find out otherwise and get harassed there. Those same people would do workarounds to communicate with you or try and the amount of those I've ran into who don't respect boundaries is astounding. It got annoying to get on just to become someones therapist and get trauma dumped on for the 100th time on a daily basis, like I don't care, I just want to play and have fun. Not spend it reporting or blacklisting people over them getting too attached or not able to take no as an answer.\n\nYou can't even ask someone if they need help with mechanics if they keep dying to it for the 50th time, they'll get mad. You can't even ask a simple question without someone throwing insults, like really? Then you got so called \"Positive toxicity\" like no get over it, I'm not enabling such crappy behavior. Some folks even tried to make it a mission to ruin your time playing if you so much as set boundaries to not deal with their personal life, not why I'm playing. Realized it was time to quit for good so I deleted my character so I wouldn't return.\n\nTLDR: Game used to be great, yet the community turned to complete garbage somewhere over the past 8 years or I'm just super unlucky. Met a few good people, but you're better off playing something else or finding a server where it's not this bad, which I wouldn't be surprised if that's not possible. WoW's BS community is much better and tame compared to FFXIV's, and I hate WoW. Everyone's nice and fake till they show otherwise, and it's just 1000x worse after you know.

to do at the same time, where i have actual full char customisation in an art-style that i actually liked that wasn't overly fantasy and allowed casual\ni've always looked forward to playing mmos but i've never really played any besides roblox (if you count that as an mmo), and ff14 ended up being my first actual mmo\n\ni decided to play in 2022 and basically played for a bit but found the actual start Really Really slow and boring because goddamn arr just felt so boring, and in bad self-boredom i decided to buy a skip to go to heavensward annnd then proceeded to not play the game again till december of 2023 and now again in jan of 2025\n\nright, actual review now:\nff14 is a Very Awesome mmorpg, with a decent story (allbeit a little reptitive) and actually engaging out of msq content such as Dressing Up and Fishing. which both somehow turned into many many hours of content (or what is going to be atp while reviewing)\n\nif you're a new player looking towards getting the game, be aware of this: arr is very sloggishly boring and may seem daunting but persevering is very, very much worth it. especially on my revisit on an NA-DC moving from EU, playing the game fresh without any skips or anything actually led me to having more insight over it and being interested in it\ni would say, find some sort of click or \"aha\" moment of the game that you find interesting, (which was me sitting 2 days ago in the limsa docks fishing and now deciding i will play this game daily), as it'll guide your motivation alot \n\ncombat in the game is kinda weird with all the rotations and stuff and what not which is EXTREMELY daunting when looking it at a major overview but when you actually progressively play you'll get the hang of it\ni'm sure everybody knows about the amazing community, which i have not yet to experience yet but hopefully soon will, but they all seem chill except for the freakazoids which are unfortunately prevelant, but squenix's tools to bl/mute them are good enough to get them out of your view anyway\n\nuhm yeah you can dress up and stuff i hate that being a cat girl was my first option because the race looks good compared to everything else, the drip is also pretty cool\n\ngood game if you wanna get into the mmo space within something light-hearted that isnt as fantasy serious as wow or as EXTREMELY CONFUSING as black desert\nanyways yeah good game

I've played for a few hundred hours and haven't even made it to Shadowbringers. Now, granted, this is between two different characters. You can definitely make it far into the game with the amount of time I've put into it. I will say this though. The dungeons and boss fights are second to none. Despite having more intricate boss encounters than a game like World of Warcraft I've had quite a bit of success partying up with groups of random people because of the way the fights are designed. The telegraphs for the bosses' attacks all have standard visual effects that let you know exactly what you have to do once you've seen them before. The game is also very forgiving for those who die during said attempts. People don't like Dawntrail, and they have their reasons. Personally, playing this game feels like exactly what you'd expect from a single player Final Fantasy outing, but you get to party up with other people. Never mind the infinite versatility of a single character, player housing and all of the cool mounts, pets, and gear in the game.

FF14 ist sicherlich ein nettes Game - f\u00fcr 10 bis 12j\u00e4hrige Teenager, die an den \u00fcbertrieben \"s\u00fc\u00dfen\" Darstellungen Gefallen finden. Ich bin mir WOW und anderen MMOs gro\u00df geworden und verglichen damit, ist FF14 kein Highlight. \n\nDie Pros sind auf jeden Fall die Grafik der Umgebung. Nett anzusehen und irgendwie stimmig. Dagegen steht aber das Design der Charaktere. Wenn ich in einer Kampfsituation (die ernst genommen werden m\u00f6chte) pl\u00f6tzlich auf kleine \"Pseudo\" Teletubbies mit gro\u00dfen Kulleraugen treffe, dann kann ich das Spiel nicht mehr ernst nehmen und muss einfach nur mehr lachen. Aber die sehen nicht nur so aus, die verhalten sich auch noch so. Die kleinen Zwerge gehen so, als h\u00e4tten sich ihre Arme versteift. \n\nDer Sound... nun, der ist auch nett. Die Ger\u00e4usche der Umgebung sind okay bis man zum ersten Dialog kommt und sieht, dass s\u00e4mtliche Charaktere ihren Mund bewegen und man sich fragt, ob vielleicht der Lautsprecher etwas hat, weil man nichts h\u00f6rt. Will hei\u00dfen, Sprachausgabe gibt es nicht - oder besser, nur bei einigen sehr wenigen Dialogen. Ansonsten ist stille angesagt. \n\nEine einzige Sache, die wirklich positiv ist und nur bei wenigen anderen aktuellen Spielen so gut umgesetzt ist (wenn \u00fcberhaupt), ist das Feature, dass man die UI fast stufenlos skalieren kann. Wer das braucht, wird sich dar\u00fcber freuen .\n\nDamit kommen wir zum Preis. \u20ac 40 f\u00fcr Dawntrail und das Base-Game sind ja f\u00fcr ein Vollpreis Spiel in Ordnung. Dann aber noch eine monatliche Geb\u00fchr zu verlangen ist nicht mehr okay.

What began as a rocky, near-disastrous launch has risen, phoenix-like, to become one of the greatest MMORPGs ever made. Combining unparalleled storytelling, a vast and vibrant world, and gameplay that caters to every type of player, FFXIV transcends its genre to deliver something truly extraordinary. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned MMO veteran or a complete newcomer, this is a game that will draw you in and refuse to let go.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you create your character and step into the bustling streets of Ul\u2019dah or Gridania, you\u2019re embarking on a journey that will take you across continents, through time and space, and to the edge of existence itself. But what makes Final Fantasy XIV so remarkable isn\u2019t just the story or the gameplay\u2014it\u2019s how it makes you feel.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of FFXIV lies its narrative, and calling it good feels like an understatement. It\u2019s the gold standard for storytelling in MMOs, rivaling even single-player RPGs in scope and emotional impact. You start as a humble adventurer, but as the Warrior of Light, you\u2019ll face gods, monsters, and existential threats to the very fabric of the universe. A Realm Reborn lays a solid foundation, but the expansions\u2014each one better than the last\u2014elevate the story to legendary heights.\r\n\r\nHeavensward is a tale of dragons and redemption, Stormblood explores themes of revolution and freedom, and Shadowbringers flips the traditional light-versus-dark narrative on its head, delivering one of the most memorable stories in gaming. By the time you reach Endwalker, an emotional, bittersweet conclusion to a decade-long saga, you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019ve truly lived through these adventures. The characters, from stoic Alphinaud to fan-favorite G\u2019raha Tia, become more than NPCs\u2014they\u2019re companions, mentors, and friends you\u2019ll never forget.\r\n\r\nBut Final Fantasy XIV isn\u2019t just about watching a story unfold; it\u2019s about being part of it. The game\u2019s flexible job system allows you to play every class on a single character, encouraging you to experiment and find your niche. Whether you prefer tanking as a Paladin, healing as a White Mage, or dishing out damage as a Dragoon, every job feels distinct and rewarding. And the combat, while approachable for newcomers, scales up to offer a challenge that will test even the most seasoned players in high-end raids.\r\n\r\nYet, FFXIV isn\u2019t solely about combat. For those who crave a more relaxed experience, the game offers robust crafting, gathering, and even fishing systems that could be entire games on their own. You can decorate your house, run a market empire, or simply spend hours fishing in serene landscapes. The freedom to play your way is one of FFXIV\u2019s greatest strengths, making it just as rewarding for casual players as it is for hardcore raiders.\r\n\r\nThe world of Eorzea, along with its expansions, is nothing short of breathtaking. Every location, from the glittering deserts of Thanalan to the icy spires of Ishgard, feels alive and meticulously crafted. The expansions continue this trend, introducing unforgettable areas like Shadowbringers\u2019 The First, a realm steeped in eternal daylight, and Endwalker\u2019s surreal vistas at the edge of existence. Complementing the stunning visuals is the game\u2019s musical score, a masterpiece by Masayoshi Soken. From gentle town themes to heart-pounding boss tracks, the music enhances every moment, leaving a lasting impression that extends beyond the game.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of Final Fantasy XIV is its community. In an online world that can often feel hostile or impersonal, FFXIV\u2019s players are a beacon of kindness and camaraderie. Newcomers, affectionately called \u201csprouts,\u201d are welcomed with advice, gifts, and encouragement. The game\u2019s mentor system ensures that veterans are there to guide the way, and you\u2019ll rarely encounter toxicity, even in high-pressure raids. Beyond the gameplay, the community shines in its creativity, hosting everything from in-game concerts to elaborate role-playing events and charity drives.\r\n\r\nEven if you\u2019re new to MMOs, FFXIV is remarkably accessible. The free trial\u2014immortalized as a meme\u2014offers an almost absurd amount of content, including A Realm Reborn and the critically acclaimed Heavensward expansion, without a subscription fee. It\u2019s the perfect way to dip your toes into this sprawling world, and before you know it, you\u2019ll be eagerly planning your next in-game adventure.\r\n\r\nBut what truly sets Final Fantasy XIV apart is its soul. It\u2019s a game that offers not just entertainment, but a sense of belonging. Whether you\u2019re facing a god-tier raid boss, fishing by a tranquil lake, or dancing with strangers in Limsa Lominsa, you\u2019ll find moments of joy, wonder, and connection. Few games can make you laugh, cry, and cheer as often as this one, and fewer still can inspire the kind of loyalty and love that FFXIV enjoys from its community.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Final Fantasy XIV is about the journey\u2014and it\u2019s a journey worth taking. Whether you\u2019re saving the world or simply trying to get your glamor just right, there\u2019s no place quite like Eorzea.

This may be my favorite I've ever experienced. The story is one of genuine beauty with every character, every detail, and every twist being treated with immense sincerity. So much of the writing points to a major theme that is etched in the essence of everything XIV encompasses: hope in the face of despair. The many stories through each expansion told may focus on their respective conflicts that eventually tie within one another, but the lessons of hope always shines over it all, leaving an irreplaceable impact on my very being. Everything has been tailored to perfection with attentive care, from the character dynamics that keep you grounded when the scales are massive, to the major plot points and worldbuilding that engulfs you whole as you journey through this immersive world. This moved me in ways I was never expecting starting this years ago and I don't think I could experience something like this game ever again. \n\nThe content of the game also adds to the amount of love I've felt, feeling infinite and sometimes overwhelming with how many choices there are. The fashion, raiding, PvP, farming, crafting, it all leaves me with so much to do every week and never fails to value my time as a player. The fact that there are little FOMO elements make it even better, never feeling forced to go out of my way to do something. \n\nThe social features are probably one of my favorite aspects however. I've met so many wonderful friends from just sitting and talking in the major cities or asking for help in party finder. It's been helping me get out of my anxious shell I usually hide in with games like this, making me realize how important human interaction is in a game so massive in scale.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV is seriously worth the price point and monthly subscription. I don't regret ever starting it and I can't wait to put even more hours into it. Seriously feels like a love letter to those who appreciate great storytelling, memorable characters, and just Final Fantasy fans.

Is it the best, nope.  Better than wow imho.  Simple, and actually is a lot more fun if you just play as you want to which is how I think it was designed.  I've played it off and on for many years.  I get bored, or into something else, I un-sub.  When I get the \"itch\" I come back.   And its easy to come back to which is one reason I really do recommend it.  Its not super complicated, and while there is a ton of things to do, nothing forces you to do any one thing unless you want to.   The gear grind is not extreme, and the content isn't hard enough to require mods (which aren't allowed and I think that is a good thing).  There is very hard content, but its not a necessity, its there if you want it and there is not a ton of it so skipping it doesn't leave you feeling like you missed out.  For these reasons I Recommend FFXIV.   I do wish the developers would invest a little more of their big $$$ into world content instead of funding their other games with the sub-money of FFXIV and that is my only real complaint.   The game has one of the better communities out there, it used to be better and I think thats across all gaming in general hate & greed are a disease and its worked its way into the FFXIV community as well.  However its still better than any (and i mean ANY) other MMO.  Which is another point in the win column for FFXIV.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, its a deep game with a ton of content if a little dated (i mean its 10+ years old now) and something you can do without feeling like you'll miss out unless you burn yourself out trying to catch up to the \"lifers\".  Community is good as a whole and its generally very stable.", "timestamp_created": 1736556725, "timestamp_updated": 1736556725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185305409": {"recommendationid": "185305409", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111699425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2280, "last_played": 1690648877}, "language": "english", "review": "Square Enix has shared a new Group Customer Harassment Policy to protect its workers from toxic fan behaviour.

Yea. I'd say pretty good. But FAR from perfect. There are so many other MMO's that have features working better than FF14 and it pains me to see this game in such a state of... wasted potential? However, what makes FF14 so good and fun to play is that it gives you so much stuff to do that you barely find yourself wondering what to do. There's always something, and nothing feels meaningless. THAT is what makes it good. \r\n\r\nStarting with positives:\r\n\r\nIt has compelling stories both base game and throughout the expansions - don't let reviews fool you, because with most things, it comes down to taste. No story is objectively good or bad - you just either don't enjoy it because it isn't for you, or you enjoy it because it is for you. I personally liked them.\r\n\r\nCrafting and Gathering, unlike in other games, doesn't feel like a stupid, stretchy grind. Not saying that it isn't, because it definitely is, but it works much better and the \"minigames\" you have during crafting or gathering are enjoyable little \"shut your head off\" times. If you're spent from grinding dungeons, raids or trials, go level a crafter or gatherer. It's so relaxing. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of content: The designs of the Raids, Dungeons and Trials are phenomenal and only get better with expansions. Some of them feel super cinematic, others just lull you in with their atmosphere and music. There's also something this game does better than other games when it comes to older content - you can \"unsync\" dungeons, raids and trials, which means you can go in as a high level character and oneshot the enemies to get their loot. Since 70% of the content is outdated and the loot is only usable as Skins (called \"Glamour\" in this game), you'll get your hands on your desired skins, pets or mounts very easily without having to queue for content no one plays anymore. Huge quality of life effects here.\r\n\r\nLeveling alts is made very easy, because you only ever need one character. Your starting class (Job in this game) does not decide what you are. You can start as a Warrior and play all the way to 100, but if you want another class, you can speak to a guild and swap to it. Your one character can learn and level EVERY class available in the game. Plus - if you already have a high level class, leveling the lower ones will go faster thanks to the so called armory bonus. Meaning you don't have to painfully grind from lvl 1-100 in the same amount of time. You get tons of bonus XP, which makes it much easier to get other classes to higher levels. \r\n\r\nNow with all those things in mind, the game does sound incredible, doesn't it? Sadly, for my taste, there are points that make me disappointed in it regardless.\r\n\r\nOutdated gameplay system: \r\n\r\nIt feels like playing an MMO from the early 2000's. While I understand the original FF14 came out 2010, the actual game we play today, which started 2013 with \"A Realm Reborn\" and replaced the failed original game, we can see that there was a lot of time to rework the clunkiness of the game. It is just hard to look at when you play things like Guild Wars 2 or Elder Scrolls Online. Given that GW2 came out 2012 - one year before FF14 launched its new approach - and has infinitely better graphics and gameplay/movement/combat, it's just sad to see FF14 this clunky and outdated. I can only enjoy this game so much before I grow tired of the same static gameplay for hours on end. \r\n\r\nHousing: \r\n\r\nFF14 still relies on the extremely stupid approach of making houses actual unique objects, meaning there is only a limited amount of houses available to the entire playerbase. To compare it to something that makes much more sense - Elder Scrolls Online utilizes individual instances for houses, meaning every player can own every house, because each player is assigned an instance of it. Also, in FF14, you lose your house if you aren't online for 40 days. That means 3,1 million Gil down the drain, because that is the minimum betting price for the smallest house size. There's no refund. \r\n\r\nClasses are unique - until they aren't:\r\n\r\nThis might be a more nitpicky thing to say, because in essence, every MMO relies on the same individual formula. My major caveat with FF14 is that no matter what class you play, you fall back to the same systems and copypasted abilities while having a marginally different rotation and some unique class abilities.\r\n\r\nAll melee DPS have positional requirements. Sometimes you flank an enemy, sometimes you attack from the rear, sometimes it doesn't matter where you stand. You get different buffs per class that have the same or extremely similar effect. You get the same abilities to heal yourself or remove positional requirements for a certain time (and by \"the same\" I mean literally the same - these skills are copypasted to each class, same name, same icon, same effect.) Nothing unique here except for the class-specific actions that are sometimes a bit more complex (Ninja, Samurai) and sometimes very straight forward (Dragoon, Monk)\r\n\r\nAll tanks have copypasted mitigation skills + two class specifics that, again, do almost the same thing just with a different name. Every tank can become invulnerable. You see where I'm getting? In essence, the only variety you have are the animations and rotations, but it doesn't matter if you play a Warrior or a Paladin. Dark Knight is a bit more different because it's limping behind the other tanks so you have to use your panic buttons a bit more, but... that's it. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I will still recommend this game. It is, after all, a pleasent experience and fun when you overlook the downsides. It's by no means a terrible game. It's sadly just never used the full potential which is available nowadays.

Most of the time I just play muted and use my own music or watch Youtube and movies. There's maybe 8 songs I will actually will listen to from this game.\n-Gameplay is very basic, if you like hitting buttons like you have ADD this is the MMORPG for you. Levels are easy to get just spam Dungeons or do Deep Dungeons or be like most people these days and just buy levels and campaign completions. \nAs for the many jobs Final Fantasy is known for, FFXIV has grouped most of them into different fields,\nYes Roles(ie: Tank, Healer, DPS) but even more now. Healers, there are 4 healers, 2 regen healers and 2 shield healers. they essentially do the same but are named different. This goes for just about every job.\nAs for updates through the years, SE has added, removed and changed skill/spells many times and have said some skills were a mistake but wont remove(yet) and others get reworked/removed almost immediately.\nAs for end game content, there are really 2 types that are constent, Savage and Extreme raids. Basically they are about the same. You fight a tough boss with mechanics that are very punishing if your not watching. \nBut the real end game for this game is really just Glamour, fashion.\n-Story is also hit and miss. ARR is an ok start, Heavensward was mostly a blur for me(some dislike it, very few actually like it), Stormblood was better, ShadowBringer was good, Endwalker was definitely the best so far, and the latest expansion Dawntrail was just boring.\n\nAs you may have picked up I have a love/hate relationship with this game.

paid subscription MMOS. Let's start with the cons, the gameplay loop after around 10 hours was basically the same, go to point A to do the mini-quest (kill enemies, get the item, help person, etc.) and return to commissioner, this got very repetitive after a while and made me want to stop playing. Issue 2, the game isn't upfront about being a subscription, I didn't find this out until after I had already bought the starter pack, if you are a light spender or don't have the money to pay monthly for subscriptions you cannot play this game, you get 30 days free and after that, it's $13 a month I highly suggest you play the 30-day trial and if the game really interests you consider buying the full version. Additionally, the character building is extremely basic, the only thing that buffs stats is armor and your weapon, you can't make a custom build to try something new as there are only a few stats you can build in the first place most of which will do nothing for your class. Finally, the combat doesn't really appeal to me, you stand still to cast a spell and trade hits with the enemy repeat. Now let's talk about some of the pros, character customization is extremely unique, you can be whoever and whatever you want, a common issue a lot of character-building games have is the choice between good-looking cosmetics and good armor, in this, you can use an item that allows you to swap the appearance to a different item and even dye it to the color of your choice with absolutely no downsides. Another thing the game has going for it is the character building and accessibility, when you create a character you choose a base path but if you get bored of it you can swap classes by simply replacing your weapon, this is really good if you get bored of a classes loop and want to try something new you won't have to make an entire new character. Overall if you take into fact that you have to pay monthly to keep playing the game it's up to you if it's really worth it, i'd personally say the cons outweigh the pros and would not recommend this game to people getting into MMOs.", "timestamp_created": 1736266183, "timestamp_updated": 1736266183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45628589391708374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184998445": {"recommendationid": "184998445", "author": {"steamid": "76561199382818299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 15217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11343, "playtime_at_review": 4219, "last_played": 1737405338}, "language": "english", "review": "some games have magic in them", "timestamp_created": 1736236214, "timestamp_updated": 1736236214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184997484": {"recommendationid": "184997484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042601719", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 763, "deck_playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1736220288}, "language": "english", "review": "Tried playing the game now on two fresh accounts both times the game refuses to let me past the EULA and a registration code BS. not worth the 3 hours i spent trying to trouble shoot it for valve to say they can't help with CD Keys.

I returned to WoW after many year as I wanted that MMORPG experience again, and my reward was the Shadowlands expansion. I'm not here to talk about WoW, just want to give some context. \r\nSome friends jumped over to FFXIV to try it out, and I figured I'd give it a try. I had that itch for an MMO. I'd never played an online Final Fantasy game, and barely played any of the Final Fantasy games at all, so I was a bit out of my element. I don't know if words can do it justice, but everything in the game was just... fun. I was leveling a class, learning about the cities, people and the story. Having a blast with the attack rotations that the game has. \r\nThe moment I knew I was hooked was when I started trying some of the crafting professions. Again, it was just pure fun. The gathering has a little mini game, the crafting has a little mini game. It was just great. I walk around town and randomly see groups of bards playing modern music. They call the game an amusement park game, and I couldn't agree more. There's a ton of fun to be had even without all the hardcore raiding and high level content. Which I should point out, have been some of the most fun boss encounters I have seen in an MMO. \r\nEven now, the game is absolutely worth getting into, or returning to. You won't be miles behind everyone, I mean, you will, but it doesn't matter as much. The whole community in this game has been fantastic. To the point where the community is known for not spoiling the story content as much as possible. \r\nI'm just putting in this review because I noticed I have over 2000 hours and haven't reviewed it.

"playtime_at_review": 1869, "last_played": 1687133604}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to begin... I am writing this initially unsure whether to upvote or downvote the game.\n\nFF is a game that has me coming back time and time again. The MMO is aging well as the design is rich and engaging. The thriving community also contributes to how enjoyable this game can be. The world is expansive and filled with characters, stories that are not only interesting but emotionally engaging. The art style of the game is modern enough to be one of the most immersive MMORPGs but also classic enough to feel like I'm booting up my ps2 in the early 2000s giving it a sort of nostalgic feel to someone who was never that involved in the franchise. \n\nGameplay wise it is fun to put it simply. Its flexible class system, extensive crafting, and gathering options offer a wealth of activities for players, while the combat mechanics are satisfying and dynamic, with regular updates and expansions that keep the experience fresh. \n\nHowever, FFXIV can be overwhelming for new players. If you are lucky enough to have a veteran you either meet in game or a friend you have to show you the ropes, it is infinitely more enjoyable. Especially with its steep learning curve and the sheer amount of content to absorb. The slow pacing of the early story, particularly in A Realm Reborn, can feel like a slog, and while the game's content is vast, the sheer volume sometimes leads to a sense of grind rather than excitement. Additionally, the reliance on certain \"busywork\" tasks can detract from the game's more engaging aspects. \n\nAnother criticism lies in FFXIV's reliance on the subscription-based model. While this ensures regular updates and continued support, it can be a barrier for casual players who don\u2019t have the time to dedicate to the game regularly. The cost of the subscription can feel harder to justify when the game's pace can be so slow at times, particularly if players are stuck in filler content that feels detached from the core experience. But on the flipside it does ward off, i hope, to some extent the use of mass amounts of ingame microtransactions. \n\nThe lack of real challenge in the game's dungeons and raids, especially when it comes to earlier content, can also be a downside. The game caters to a wide range of players, which means that many encounters are simplified to ensure accessibility for everyone. While this is a positive for casual players or those just starting out, it also removes some of the sense of danger and accomplishment. Even endgame content can feel far too easy for veterans who have mastered their classes, leading to frustration when trying to find a truly challenging experience.\n\nDespite the busy work or overwhelming nature that comes inherently with the genre i suppose, the game is enjoyable. It excels in creating a deeply rewarding game system that not only enhances your path throughout the game but also rewarding emotionally as well, of course for those willing to grind it out. For those who are willing to invest the time, the game is enjoyable and the community is welcoming. \n\nI'd tentatively recommend it to anyone looking to get into the MMORPG genre in 2025. Thankfully the free trial is more than enough to get a grasp on whether or not the game is for you.\n\nPS. The community is very welcoming however it can at the beginning feel some what alienating for solo players, especially for someone who does not have their sort of clique yet in the game. The emphasis on community and group content and events can feel somewhat exclusive. Often I find it to be forced social interaction when I just want to grind or play the game for myself for a moment.", "timestamp_created": 1735675599, "timestamp_updated": 1735675645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184355886": {"recommendationid": "184355886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358502275", "num_games_owned": 1946, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1735670857}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy a game and then 30 days later pay 15 dollars a month", "timestamp_created": 1735670787, "timestamp_updated": 1735670787, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500026702880859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184355509": {"recommendationid": "184355509", "author": {"steamid": "76561199108063353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1121, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1736662166}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing mmo for playing solo and the friendliest mmo community ive ever seen", "timestamp_created": 1735670494, "timestamp_updated": 1735670494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184343520": {"recommendationid": "184343520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198884460981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 121512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121512, "last_played": 1732466779}, "language": "polish", "review": "gowno", "timestamp_created": 1735662516, "timestamp_updated": 1735662516, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484646201133728027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184333153": {"recommendationid": "184333153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116359202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1748, "playtime_at_review": 18149, "last_played": 1736830786}, "language": "english", "review": "Great MMO experience!

Tamb\u00e9 penso que extret el que costa i fent un c\u00e0lcul raonable el jugador que juga tot l'any hauria de pagar m\u00e9s que el juga cada tres mesos o quan pot. Per posar un exemple:\r\n\r\n- Pagues x a l'any si vols jugar tot l'any. Si jugues menys de 10 mesos pagues: x-y. Si jugues menys de 7 mesos pagues: x-y-z  Finalment, si jugues menys de 4  mesos pagues x-y-z-t.\r\n\r\nLa hist\u00f2ria principal est\u00e0 allargada de mala manera i evidentment \u00e9s la t\u00edpica. A m\u00e9s les missions d'una que se salva i n'hi ha 8 que no. Ves al paio del costat i explica-li no s\u00e9 qu\u00e8. Porta un ou al paio de la planta de sota. Tot aix\u00f2 no mereix ni que provis el trial gratu\u00eft.\r\n\r\nL'altra cr\u00edtica negativa \u00e9s m\u00e9s profunda i portaria debat. M'expressar\u00e9 breument. Penso que un oci sigui: llegir un llibre, anar gimn\u00e0s, jugar a un videojoc, etc. No t'hauria d'alentir a l'addici\u00f3 sistem\u00e0tica. Aquest videojoc i com d'altres ajuden aix\u00f2. I \u00e9s molt perill\u00f3s. Est\u00e0 b\u00e9 gaudir, per\u00f2 que el videojoc gaudeixi de tu i del teu temps \u00e9s massa perill\u00f3s.\r\n\r\nPer mi \u00e9s un suspens: 3-3,1.\r\n\r\nIf you like this review and want to help us with our objective, please join us! http://steamcommunity.com/groups/catalantranslation", "timestamp_created": 1735634956, "timestamp_updated": 1735634956, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434938997030258179", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184307337": {"recommendationid": "184307337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088098724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 380915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3550, "playtime_at_review": 376118, "last_played": 1737355050}, "language": "english", "review": "yeh", "timestamp_created": 1735633024, "timestamp_updated": 1735633024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184278495": {"recommendationid": "184278495", "author": {"steamid": "76561199630126183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1736100934}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "GOD", "timestamp_created": 1735611069, "timestamp_updated": 1735611069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184278456": {"recommendationid": "184278456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249931786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 388282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1940, "playtime_at_review": 386341, "last_played": 1737405147}, "language": "english", "review": "Even after 6.4k hours I don't get tired of this game", "timestamp_created": 1735611035, "timestamp_updated": 1735611035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184271591": {"recommendationid": "184271591", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076461092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6905, "playtime_at_review": 5367, "last_played": 1737403817}, "language": "english", "review": "GUD GAM I LIKE GAME MUCH LOVE", "timestamp_created": 1735604945, "timestamp_updated": 1735604945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184267133": {"recommendationid": "184267133", "author": {"steamid": "76561199783994307", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1735845659}, "language": "dutch", "review": "De game werk niet ik kan inloggen maar daar houdt het ook mee op \nHet spel start niet eens op krijg links boven in de hoek een zwart scherm dat probeert op te starten maar dan staat er dat het niet reageert heb hulp nodig alsjeblieft wil het heel graag spelen op mij oude account", "timestamp_created": 1735601355, "timestamp_updated": 1735601355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184266421": {"recommendationid": "184266421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028863399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 37147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37068, "last_played": 1735891237}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, especially if you have 500 hours to kill!", "timestamp_created": 1735600748, "timestamp_updated": 1735600748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184265626": {"recommendationid": "184265626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866846535", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2134, "playtime_at_review": 21031, "last_played": 1737121770}, "language": "english", "review": "started playing like two or three years ago when Endwalker came out.
