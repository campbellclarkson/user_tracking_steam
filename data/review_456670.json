Each card can have different outcomes based on the choices you have selected, or how well you do in the minigames. The minigames are dice, cards, roulette, and pendulum. Most of the minigames have some skill that you can develop over time, and have cards that will help with the process. The game has decent missions that are varied. The downside is that combat is a bit repetitive once you have learned the enemy patterns. Usually only one person attacks you at a time, otherwise you'd just be shredded instantly. The other thing about combat is that there is a weird timing issue between when you start a finishing move and when you are invincible. I've been hurt by enemies after I've started the finisher animation. Some of the equipment unlocks are also a pain to do. There is one where you have to defeat 12 mages with a weapon. Only issue is that mages are rather rare, so to defeat 12 mages require you to grind a few missions to unlock it.

This game takes the original Hand of Fate, polishes it to a shine, and then adds just the right amount of chaos to keep you guessing.\n\nWhat I Loved:\n\u2705 The Dealer: The real MVP of the game. He\u2019s part narrator, part dungeon master, and full-time smug jerk who delights in your suffering. Honestly, I both love and hate this guy.\n\n\u2705 Card-Based Storytelling: Every encounter feels like a roll of the dice (or the turn of a card). It\u2019s a brilliant blend of strategy and luck that keeps every run fresh.\n\n\u2705 Combat: The action sequences are more polished than the first game, mixing fluid Arkham-style melee combat with moments of sheer panic when the RNG decides to ruin your day.\n\n\u2705 Choices: Each card encounter lets you shape your adventure. Will you help the starving townsfolk or rob them blind? The Dealer\u2019s judging you either way, so go wild.\n\n\u2705 Replayability: With tons of cards, companions, and challenges to unlock, every playthrough feels unique. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, the game deals you a new twist.\n\nWhat Made Me Want to Throw My Keyboard:\n\u26a0\ufe0f RNG Madness: Sometimes the dice rolls feel like the Dealer is actively cheating. You\u2019ll scream when you fail a 75% success chance three times in a row.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Pacing: The later challenges can drag a bit as you grind for better equipment or repeatedly fail encounters because RNG is life.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Difficulty Spikes: The game goes from \u201cI got this\u201d to \u201cWHY IS EVERYTHING ON FIRE\u201d with zero warning.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nHand of Fate 2 is a unique and addictive experience that blends card games, dungeon crawling, and action combat into something truly special. The Dealer is a snarky delight, the gameplay keeps you on your toes, and the storytelling feels like a living, breathing D&D campaign.\n\nJust don\u2019t come crying when a dice roll ruins your carefully planned strategy. The Dealer doesn\u2019t care\u2014and honestly, that\u2019s part of the charm.\n\n9/10 would rage at RNG again.", "timestamp_created": 1735076102, "timestamp_updated": 1735076102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520676672458648682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 4769, "total_negative": 873, "total_reviews": 5642}, "cursors": {"AoJ4ye7e6owDeLmZ0AQ=": "Mon Jan 20 19:13:37 2025"}}
