I'm just so unhappy with Battle of Stalingrad.  So much feels wrong about the sim.  \n\nNavigating menus shouldn't be this slow and clunky.  It's like the application is waiting to query some DRM server on the other side of the moon, every single time I try to advance a day in a career.  How hard is it to query a database and populate a spreadsheet?\n\nMost of the careers are simply unplayable as far as I'm concerned, and I want my money back.  I'm not going to spend forty five minutes crossing the English Channel or French countryside as an American, British or late-war German pilot.  This was the single worst part of 1946 and I guess I'm just an idiot for thinking that in  the better part of 2 decades, somebody would have figured out a more convenient form of time compression.  No: they actually reduced it to 2x, and pretend like it goes up to 8x.\n\nThe worst thing is the money grubbing.  I went into it with my eyes open, knowing the customer base is dominated by well-to-do hobbyist whales, and that modern day people, in general, lack the principle needed to not take advantage of such a market.  I could see the store page and I could see how bad it was.  What I didn't expect was to buy DLC and load in, just to be lied to in the game menu and told \"yeah, you can join this squadron.  You own this plane.\"  Only to find out that the squadron doesn't get that plane until August, and unless I want to fly a piece of crap instead (or spend more money), all I can do is sit there and click \"next day\" for ninety minutes, until the squadron gets issued the plane I actually paid for.\n\nVery often, starting a recording with the built-in tool causes the game to enter an unintentional slow motion state.  My rig is well beyond the system requirements, with double the RAM and 100gb available on an SSD for a paging file.  This shouldn't be happening.\n\nThe AI has gone to plaid.  The only plane they can reliably see and interact with is the player's.  This leads to absurd trains of AI planes looping round and round in a ragged line, like Soviet drones, too afraid of the commissar to break formation.  They seem more likely than ever to collide, and couldn't care less when another bot gets on their six and spends twenty seconds pumping their wings full of bullets.  They just keep flying straight and level, pumping machine gun bullets into another plane who is also ignoring them and flying straight and level as [i]their[/i] wings get pumped full of bullets.  Of course, as soon as the player gets within 300 meters they see you however: it doesn't matter if you're six o'clock low in the sun.  They start juking.\n\nThe more time I spend in this \"sim\" the angrier I get.  This is outrageous.  I've played early access games that were more stable, feature-rich and polished.

It is a game for all players who wish to feel what it was like being a pilot in those days and experiencing the same combat scenarios as the pilots faced back in the day. Let it be known first and foremost that you will need a flight stick, this is paramount I simply used a inexpensive logitech stick purchased from Walmart and fair warning you may have to set up controls on your flight stick. I am not sure, I had to a little bit though so without further adieu: Let's get started with my honest review.\n\nThis game can be very overwhelming at first but also a game that will give you arcade like options so you are not overwhelmed. But most likely you will be overwhelmed, especially if you are not used to sims. But please don't let that hurt you. Although this is true you just need to try it along with using options given to you by the game to help you along the ride, it takes practice. I won't lie, but I think once you start getting a feel for it, you will truly appreciate it for what it is and see how hard they really made a game into what it is. \n\nThe options they give you to help ease your worries are options like unlimited ammo, automatic radiator engine cools for fuel mixtures (Yeah I definitely have to have this checked marked I have no idea what I am doing.) A aiming assist, throttle assist, invulnerability you know you want to fly in a swarm of foes and smile as they can't touch you, rudder assist, unbreakable, autopilot (This is just a on/off option that allows you to let the AI take over for you in case you want to do something else or so), and many more to help you feel more at ease. \n\nYou have game modes like career's, campaign's, quick play, multiplayer, and possibly another that I can't think of. I will go into a little bit of this in depth since I firstly want to stress something for you the player to read and understand before getting yourself into this.\n\nYes this game has several DLC, yes they can be pretty gosh darn pricey and I understand that I really do. I myself am one to not buy stuff unless its real cheap. But you have to understand what it is you the player wants from this game, you have to read the details of each and really ask yourself what it is you want to do. Do you want to play in WWI era? Do you want to play a specific faction like The Soviet Union during set timelines along WWII? Do you want to fly US planes? Once you figure that out a lot of options open up to you. I myself have  purchased Flying Circus Vol 1-2, Battle of Kuban deluxe, Battle of Stalingrad deluxe, Late war bundle. \n\nNow for the game modes and what each gives you. \nCareer, this is basically what it sounds like. You pick to play as a faction for whatever Battle of___/Flying circus you may own and you are a fictional character with a fun biography to read about their past and play whatever country you wish to play for. Be it Soviet union, USA, Britain, or Germany and maybe another Country that I can't think of at the moment, possibly France. Depending on again, what you own. \n* You can set options to realistically play a slow day by day process, change how many ground targets, enemy pilots are in the game maps, where you start be it on the ground or flying in the skies. \n* You can join real life squadrons at the time which have been historically accurate with each squadron/group having a specific plane/planes so if you want to play a bomber role look for planes that have a bomb icon. Tired of playing the bomber only role? No worries you can easily transfer to another unit and be a fighter pilot after your mission.\n* The modes so far that I have experienced have been relocating to a new airfield, bomber escort, free hunt, bomber hunt, destroy enemy balloon survey's (WWI), patrol. Mostly I have played WWI flying circus vol. 1-2 so far so I can't fully speak for WWII just yet. \n\nCampaigns. \nIf you want campaigns and I mean a lot of campaigns, try look at the Battle of Kuban deluxe bundle. You get many campaigns from that purchase. I think Flying circus vol 1 gave me 2-3 campaigns maybe 4 but don't quote me on that as it may have been from Volume II. \n*These you get to read a novel like story of situations and do things like dogfighting, bombing, whatever. You hear a lot of radio chatter (except for WWI that doesn't exist for the most part just yet.) and enjoy these little scenario's. My only complaint about these so far (And really I only played a little bit of a flying circus campaign (cant think of the name) and The Sea dragons campaign.) Is the fact that I cannot change loadouts with what I want or add options like enemy superiority so I have a lot of fun and a lil bit of chaos. I guess that's what career mode is for. They are enjoyable.\n\nQuick play\nBasically these give a lot of scenarios you can choose to pick out from and play as whatever nations you may have along with said planes and enjoy whatever you wish to do. Want to relax yourself for a fair while and just fly in the skies while on your way to bomb something to kingdom come? Go for it. Want to be in a dogfight? Be my guest. I'll be honest in saying I haven't looked at these too much just yet. But just know the options are open to you. \n\nMultiplayer\nNo comment, I don't play PvP. Sorry guys! \n\nModding \nThere is no workshop unfortunately, or a box to look at all the amazing mods players have made for this game. But just know its out there. This of course cancels your wishes to join multiplayer so please be aware of that. I can't speak for all the mods out there as I have not looked at them in depth. Just know its open for you to use and enjoy. \n\nLevel editor\nI know this game has it. Not sure how to access it. Maybe from the library? I don't know. Haven't looked into this, but again just know the option is open to you. Here's hoping that its easy...\n\nOptions\nThere are many options to set for the game. I am used to the Imperial measurement system so I have to set mine to that. My complaint on this however is if you were to do a campaign or career mode they still want to use the metric system in details of the mission instead of switching to the imperial system when you have this toggled on. There's basic mini map settings (not sure why I have to keep setting the option for my mini map to be large, I wish I didn't. But ignore me, just press M while playing that changes the size/removes it too. Its nice to have a FPS limit setting. I don't need to be crazy so I just set this at 60.\n\nFinal things to know. \n*There is a speed up option. You have x2. x4, x8 speeds. Not sure if anyone really can do x8. But hey, it's out there. Even if you set your game speed to it it may still feel like for example......speed x2 speed. This is to keep your gaming running optimal and not make your PC go bonkers I guess. I could be wrong on this. But I think when I set my FPS limit to 60 this caused my speed to not go past a X2 speed. So if you want to go faster, maybe go unlimited. I have to do further testing on this. But that's just what it feels like. I only use this option when I have to fly long distances/set my pilot to auto pilot and have the AI takeover for me during say bomber escort missions since those can be long. \n*When you are trying to figure out what to buy. My advice is to do a little video research on said career's, battle of's, flying circus. Whatever just so you can see what timelines are opened up to you along with said planes and said nations available to you in whatever. I'm not asking you to watch them actually play, just look at what you can do.\nHere is a little example. Flying Circus Vol 1-2 takes place during late WWI time period. So for example you will not have access to say 1916 planes. But I can do some in 1917, not much but some. Mostly I can do 1918. So be aware of that. You will see what I mean when you start a career.  \nI hope you find this review helpful. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735396088, "timestamp_updated": 1735396088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638777494430541992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183938672": {"recommendationid": "183938672", "author": {"steamid": "76561199768629632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1735628200}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly i havent run into a single problem. great game", "timestamp_created": 1735350326, "timestamp_updated": 1735350326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183903409": {"recommendationid": "183903409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145550585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 795, "playtime_at_review": 1778, "last_played": 1737304233}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoed Il-2 from their first game in 2001, over the Forgotten Battles, 1946 etc Add-Ons.

I guess they are busy producing new buggy games instead of fixing the old ones.\n\nAlso there are really less than 5 fighter planes.
