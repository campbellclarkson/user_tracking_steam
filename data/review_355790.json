You're a master sneaker not a master warrior. Styx can take on one or two guys but he gets locked into an animation while executing a dude and can generally only take a few hits, armored enemies are much more common now, you need to use the environment to kill them (dropping stuff on their heads, pushing them off ledges, traps)\n\nWay more customisation options,a much more complex skill tree in addition to different outfits and daggers with effects that change your playstyle. If you really want you can go naked styx with no dagger for the true goblin experience.\nThere's also crafting which seems lame at first, but as I played more I liked how it rewarded you for exploring the levels. The new items fill in a good few niches that didn't exist in MoS (Distractions, traps, stun) and the best one by far is the cocoon, which massively increases your options for traversal.\n\nThe soundtrack is also fantastic, the combination of the cello and grungy horn is very goblin'y, there's also musical stingers that activate when you kill a guy, get spotted or almost fall.\n\n\nBadstuffs:\nStyx is very different in this game than his other 2 depictions. If you like comic book quipsters like deadpool and spiderman you might like this version of the goblin. But for me he feels a little obnoxious and I prefer the edgy antisocial rebel goblin in MoS.\n\nThe only area where I think MoS beats this game is in story. Everything else is way better (environments, platforming etc). The story is pretty much just a bunch of excuses to creep around in cool places which are more varied and interesting than MoS but the reason for doing it isn't as compelling. And don't get me started on that crappy cliffhanger ending.\n\nI liked helledryn and styx as a duo, a goblin exterminator and a pro goblin becoming allies and friends is fun.\nbut other than that the story sucks.\n\nOverall: \n8.5/10. Great gameplay and soundtrack but the story is bland with an unsatisfying ending.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735733271, "timestamp_updated": 1735733271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51739811897277832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184389609": {"recommendationid": "184389609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288449590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 172, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1736365681}, "language": "french", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1735700371, "timestamp_updated": 1735700371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184335540": {"recommendationid": "184335540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055940305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1404, "last_played": 1735601091}, "language": "spanish", "review": "After 8 years, it is done. 10/10 would coop again.", "timestamp_created": 1735657238, "timestamp_updated": 1735657238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184306776": {"recommendationid": "184306776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168862827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1353, "last_played": 1735514189}, "language": "english", "review": "more", "timestamp_created": 1735632526, "timestamp_updated": 1735632526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184097463": {"recommendationid": "184097463", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960294435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2189, "last_played": 1735383649}, "language": "english", "review": "Great stealth game in a fantasy setting.
