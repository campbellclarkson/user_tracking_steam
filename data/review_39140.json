Adorei tanto a batalha em turnos que despertou meu interesse para jogar jogos nesse estilo, tamb\u00e9m os outros da franquia FF, mesmo n\u00e3o sendo f\u00e3 do bate e espera.\n\nExiste uma variedade gigantesca de skills/summons/builds e tamb\u00e9m diversas armas e items, o que n\u00e3o deixa a gameplay ficar mon\u00f3tona. S\u00e3o v\u00e1rios personagens jog\u00e1veis, todos bem trabalhados e com backstory interessante. O trio inicial foi minha party durante todo o jogo (usei a Aeris at\u00e9 certa parte).\n\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 magn\u00edfica, sendo o ponto mais forte. A trama \u00e9 envolvente e apresenta grandes reviravoltas, consegue ser imprevis\u00edvel e muito criativa. Essa ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o, tamb\u00e9m a desigualdade e guerra pol\u00edtica no meio do enredo nutre muito a curiosidade do jogador para saber o desfecho. O antagonista \u00e9 realmente incr\u00edvel.

And now that device has broke down after nearly a decade of wear and tear. Now, if I want to play FF1-FF6, I have buy them all over again. If Square-Enix enjoy making their games so inaccessible and do things that waste customers' money, fine. I will never purchase anything developed by Square-Enix again! I should have known that Square-Enix has become a cash grab developer when they made games like FFBE, Mobius FF etc. It was foolish of me to think that this attitude of Square Enix's won't affect single purchase games.\n\nConclusion: Square Enix is also corrupted to the core now, just like Activison and EA.

revolutionized the RPG genre and remains one of the most beloved games of all time. \r\nThe game\u2019s story is a blend of action, drama, and deep emotional moments. \r\nThemes of identity, loss, and friendship are explored with great depth, making the characters feel real and relatable. \r\nCloud, Tifa, Aerith, and Barret become unforgettable companions, and their personal journeys resonate long after the game ends.\r\nThe turn-based combat system is both accessible and strategic, with the materia system offering a vast array of customization options for each character. \r\nThe world of Final Fantasy VII is expansive, filled with memorable locations, side quests, and secrets, encouraging exploration. \r\nThe music, composed by Nobuo Uematsu, is iconic, with tracks like \"One-Winged Angel\" and \"Aerith\u2019s Theme\" leaving a lasting impact.\r\nVisually, though quite dated by today\u2019s standards, the game\u2019s pre-rendered backgrounds and character models have an undeniable charm that adds to its nostalgic allure. \r\nThe pacing is near perfect, with a sense of adventure and tension that drives the story forward.\r\nFinal Fantasy VII is more than just a game; it\u2019s an experience that redefined RPGs for a generation. \r\nIts influence on the industry is undeniable, and it continues to captivate players, old and new. \r\nIf you haven\u2019t played it yet, you\u2019re

La m\u00fasica, compuesta por Nobuo Uematsu, se adapta perfectamente a cada situaci\u00f3n, desde la \u00e9pica batalla contra un jefe hasta los momentos m\u00e1s tranquilos y emotivos. Es de esas melod\u00edas que se quedan grabadas en la mente para siempre, evocando recuerdos de las aventuras en el mundo de Gaia.\n\nLos personajes son el coraz\u00f3n de la historia. Cada uno tiene una personalidad \u00fanica y un desarrollo que te hace sentir profundamente conectado con ellos. Aerith, mi maravillosa cetra y la diosa a la que siempre rezo, con su pureza y sacrificio. Tifa, mi incre\u00edble pelinegra de coraz\u00f3n fuerte y valiente, siempre protegiendo a los que ama. Yuffie, la so\u00f1adora y lianta que aporta un toque de humor y frescura. Vincent, mi amor eterno, con su misterioso y doloroso pasado. Red, mi adorable cachorrito que demuestra que el amor y la lealtad no tienen l\u00edmites. Y, por supuesto, el recuerdo de Zack, un personaje que dej\u00f3 una huella imborrable en mi coraz\u00f3n, cuyo sacrificio se convierte en una de las piedras angulares de la saga. No podemos olvidar a los villanos, con Sephiroth a la cabeza, uno de los antagonistas m\u00e1s carism\u00e1ticos y complejos que existen.\n\nLa jugabilidad, con su sistema de combate por turnos, es cl\u00e1sica pero profunda, ideal para los amantes del g\u00e9nero. Final Fantasy VII nunca decepciona en ese aspecto y sigue siendo un referente.\n\nY la historia\u2026 ah, la historia. Final Fantasy VII tiene la capacidad de tocarte el alma, con sus giros, su tragedia, pero tambi\u00e9n con sus momentos de esperanza. La lucha de Cloud por recordar su pasado, la conexi\u00f3n con sus amigos, la lucha contra el mal y la b\u00fasqueda de un prop\u00f3sito en medio de tanto caos, todo te llega al coraz\u00f3n y te hace reflexionar sobre la vida, el amor y la p\u00e9rdida. Para m\u00ed, es y siempre ser\u00e1 mi Final Fantasy favorito, (aunque Crisis Core tiene un lugar muy especial en mi coraz\u00f3n, especialmente por Zack y Genesis).\n\nEs un juego que tengo en casi todas las plataformas, porque siempre quiero regresar a ese mundo, a esos personajes, a esa historia que nunca pierde su magia.

great. I found the controls pretty clunky and the older graphics made some buttons and world items you were supposed to click on quite hard to see. In 1997 they would look state of the art so I can't fault the game when I am playing it nearly 30 years later. A few of the minigames only explained what to do once and then threw you right into it leading to a lot of frustration because I didn't grasp what I was supposed to do. Was a fun running joke I said to friends that whenever I got stuck I was officially dumber than an 8 year old in 1997 who could figure it out back then. I even ended up having to write down some button translations since the game didn't display the playstation controller buttons. I had a crash 20 hours in that completely deleted my save file which was annoying, but besides that it ran pretty well. Despite this the world, map and animations of moves and attacks actually weren't half bad for a game so old. Much like FFX, it was cool summoning giant creatures to turn the tide of battle. \n\nWhen it came to combat, the game actually didn't show its age at all. FF7 features a turn based system, but with a timer that signified when you and enemies could take a turn. This means that while you are trying to figure out a plan of attack, the enemy can hit you. While I still prefer straight up turn based, I kind of loved that challenge. Having to think on your feet and be prepared meant that you could get punished for making mistakes more. Each team member could for the most part be built however you liked so there wasn't any real restrictions on who you had in your party unless you were doing a specific quest for one of them. The materia system allowed for sick combos and the balancing of those with how much hp and mp the character had led to some tough decisions and setups. \n\nThe story of FF7 really shines and stands the test of time. It hits all the emotions and is well worth putting up with the really old gameplay. It brought a lot of challenges and really tested my patience at times, but I am really glad I played it. It has made me even more excited to see the story and characters in a modern light with the remakes and I now know what all the hype behind it was. I can completely understand why everyone lost their minds about it back when it came out and despite all its flaws I would still recommend it for jrpg enthusiasts. \n", "timestamp_created": 1736555452, "timestamp_updated": 1736555452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185291916": {"recommendationid": "185291916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034145915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "playtime_at_review": 577, "last_played": 1736615044}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Top.

Normally, if you leave a room from a door on the left wall in the game, on the outside, this door will now be on the right, which makes sense, since you left walking to the left. Not here, on this game the perspective of the camera will almost always change and the door will be on the left wall, the same direction you're facing, which means, if you hold your left directional, you'll keep entering and leaving the same room in a loop, so every time you leave or enter a room you have to let go of the directional and wait to see which direction you'll be facing on the next room before moving. \n\nSome of those little things can get a bit annoying relly fast, but that's just how old JRPGs are, i guess, so that's only a small part of the reason behind my negative review.\n\nFirst, the game (a 10 years old port for a 30 years old single player game), requires you to create and log in to an external Square Enix account. The reason why is simply beyond me, but i don't like it.\n\nSecond, the game has occasional lag for a few seconds, which really shouldn't happen, given how low the requisites are.\n\nThird, the controls do feel a bit janky sometimes and playing on controller limits some of your actions for some reason, for example, i can't skip (the skippable) cutscenes on controller, i have to reach to my keyboard to press enter. I don't understand why the confirm button on the controller couldn't do that. Sometimes it's also inconvenient to aim your attacks given how slippery/inconsistent the controls feel, and since there is a timer for attacks and you can get punished for not attacking fast enough, sometimes it's easier to just spam the confirm button and let your character launch whatever attack at whoever he wants to.\n\nLastly, and this is the most annoying problem i had by far. Pressing alt+tab freezes the entire game (It turns into a black screen) and makes you unable to minimize or close the game, forcing you to have a second monitor to open tab manager and force close the game or simply restart your PC. I had to reset my save like 4 times because i accidentaly pressed alt+tab to do things as minor as turning down the volume.\n\nAnd those are just the problems i faced in under an hour of gameplay, so i can only imagine what would happen throughout a 60 to 70 hours long run. I do plan on trying to finish the game, but i can't help but point out those inconsistencies. The story might be good (i wouldn't know, since i haven't played much), but the port is definitely pretty ass.", "timestamp_created": 1736196286, "timestamp_updated": 1736196286, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184950084": {"recommendationid": "184950084", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216139230", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1386, "playtime_at_review": 3265, "last_played": 1736138773}, "language": "english", "review": "masterpiece\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1736186982, "timestamp_updated": 1736186982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184937980": {"recommendationid": "184937980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189685642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1766, "playtime_at_review": 1713, "last_played": 1736258823}, "language": "english", "review": "damn", "timestamp_created": 1736177899, "timestamp_updated": 1736177899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184921953": {"recommendationid": "184921953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116765431", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "playtime_at_review": 1241, "last_played": 1736414177}, "language": "german", "review": "Leider kommt es an das Original nicht heran. \n\nDie leicht aufgebesserte Grafik, macht die anscheinend durch Google \u00fcbersetzten Texte, nicht besser.\nGanz schlimm ist das hinzuf\u00fcgen von M\u00fcndern, wo vorher keine waren.

The materia system is so cool, the dungeons are fun, the story is fantastic, just a great game from start to finish. But honestly, the official translation sucks. It's poorly written, every dialogue feels stilted, it's good enough for you to get the story, but nothing more, honestly might be the worst official Final Fantasy translation. Even on a first playthrough, I recommend using the Shinra Archaeology Cut mod with the Vanilla preset. The mod itself restores a ton of cut content, but the Vanilla preset changes nothing but the translation to be closer to the original Japanese script (afaik), and it's better written in every way. Less typos, more natural dialogue, good stuff. Couple that with the 30fps battles mod and you're honestly good to go.\n\nThe 7th Heaven mod manager itself also has some neat features like anti-aliasing, resolution options, analogue control for 360 degree movement, realtime lighting, and a setting to change the color scheme of the game to simulate how it would look on official Japanese hardware at the time like the game was designed for, which looks a lot better imo.", "timestamp_created": 1735755204, "timestamp_updated": 1735990759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184447945": {"recommendationid": "184447945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091898553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 740, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1736135012}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal classic!", "timestamp_created": 1735752258, "timestamp_updated": 1735752258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184447705": {"recommendationid": "184447705", "author": {"steamid": "76561199201105654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1957, "playtime_at_review": 1957, "last_played": 1735752077}, "language": "english", "review": "preey goo", "timestamp_created": 1735752099, "timestamp_updated": 1735752099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184439272": {"recommendationid": "184439272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972304078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 343, "playtime_at_review": 4441, "last_played": 1736454859}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a very good reason the industry keeps coming back to this game.", "timestamp_created": 1735745822, "timestamp_updated": 1735745822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184425338": {"recommendationid": "184425338", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032320321", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4490, "last_played": 1699546689}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ecf\u5178\u4e4b\u4f5c", "timestamp_created": 1735735358, "timestamp_updated": 1735735358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184404409": {"recommendationid": "184404409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150618384", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 6143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1091, "playtime_at_review": 6143, "last_played": 1735715226}, "language": "english", "review": "There will always be a sense of nostalgia about playing this game.

The game is incredible for its time, with phenomenal music, a beautiful world, captivating characters, and a riveting story. Some mechanics feel dated, and you 100% need a guide as some crucial items are easily missable, but it's an experience worth giving a try. However, the PC version of this game has instability issues which result in random crashes - and since this game has no autosave, that can mean losing lots of progress. Additionally, the cloud saving feature it boasts is done through Square Enix, which forces you to sign in with a Square Enix account in order to actually play the game. I think this means you can't play this version without an Internet connection, which is absurd given the game's older than Steam itself. Also, if the cloud saving feature fails for any reason, you can't even save locally, which at one point made me lose progress as well. I'd say about 15-20% of my playtime on Steam was having to replay sections due to these issues. This made minor annoyances (high random encounter rate, unskippable cutscenes, RNG on fleeing battles) turn into major frustrations.

Storytelling and characters are superb. Cloud/protagonist does not fit traditional/cliche masculine frames, at best I can describe him as Don Quixote x Orpheus, he is very attractive and deep character as well as his companions, especially Tifa.\n2. The level design is a cinematic work of art combining 3D figurines with prerendered landscapes. It does not look dated like one might say, it looks different. Blaming it for not being realistic is like blaming \"Dark Crystal\" for not being CGI. The game is not at all obsolete.\n3. Game mechanics are essentially turn-based strategy with a time-limited decision making and diverse strategies provided by combining materia (spells) and equipment.\n4. Soundtrack is a work of genius. It fits the locations and the events and worthy of listening of its own. \nFlaws:\n1. UX is rather bad and UI is confusing and inefficient. Curiously it is not very different from original Pokemon for Gameboy.\n2. You can get stuck quite a few times, having no clue how to move forward.
