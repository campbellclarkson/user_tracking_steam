Its very hard to get into it as its quite overwhelming. i always say u just get the hang of it after the first 100 hours, and even then ure just into the basics. Even now i wouldnt describe myself as an really good player, it feels like im just not a total noob anymore. But with that out of the way i can now focus on the amazing side of this game. It will keep u entertained forever as every run is different and u can vary in playsytles and goals, be really efficent or do some roleplay there are no Limits. And the best part is if u find some freinds to play with and do a run together were u can share dlcs aswell. The sharing dlcs part is espacially nice in the begining since to be fair the game is pretty much unplayable or at least just a shadow of itsself without them and there quite the investment if ure just starting out. ive talked fo hours with freinds about the runs we have even when we werent playing. Scheming giving advice, exchaning tacits or just partitioning the world. And ontop of all the fun ive had, i learned a lot! From History, geography to cultures. So its an overall Great game and i highly advice u to play it", "timestamp_created": 1737047869, "timestamp_updated": 1737047869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I can safely say...\n\nHOLY SHIT. HOLY SHIT. It is the best strategy game I've ever played. So good, in fact, that instead of talking about my girlfriend (who, contrary to the girlfriends of many, would probably fucking love this game) or how much of my life I've wasted... I'm going to... *GASP!* Actually talk about the fucking game!\n\nSo, the game takes place from 1444 to 1821, though even your really good campaigns will probably last until about 1650 at most unless it's an achievement run or world conquest. You can expect a single campaign to be anywhere from 5 to 100 hours in length depending on the game speed you prefer, when you drop the campaign, your playstyle, the starting position of your nation and how good you are at the game (and/or how long it takes until you realize a run is utterly fucked, give up, and go play a campaign elsewhere or take a break from the game.) You play as one of many nations throughout the world, from the kingdoms of Western Europe and the princes of the Holy Roman Empire, just leaving the feudal age and starting to question the Pope, to Eastern Europe and the Balkans (yes, for all you Romaboos, Byzantium/the ERE is playable, but it is PAIN) where the Ottomans will soon sweep through on a path of conquest, to the Middle East and Africa where a variety of faiths, from the Sunnis and Shias of Arabia and Persia, where the Mamluks and Ottomans will conquer and the Timurids are about to fall, the Ibadis of North Africa, the Coptics in Ethiopia, and the squabbling between Muslims and African pagans (known as Fetishists in-game) throughout the continent. In Asia, Japan is about to experience the Sengoku, Ming China is having a golden age but can (and will) fracture at any moment with the hordes on its back, and India is full of empires whose networks of alliances will almost certainly frustrate you at every turn, and southeast Asia sees the fall of Srivijaya and the rise of such empires as the Ayuthaya. In the Americas, which if you're playing a mega campaign appear for the first time in this game, the natives form confederacies (referred to as federations in-game) and migrate aimlessly, unaware of what awaits them once the colonists (be they Europeans, Asians, or even Africans) come into their shores... And finally, Australia... The land down under is boring as fuck. 90% of us haven't played there because... It's literally just hundreds of years for waiting for colonists to arrive so you can actually do anything outside of Australia, and for what, Fetishism under a different name and the federation feature?\n\nConquest is the name of the game, gameplay wise. This is a map painter, after all, and whether you're playing tall and building cities that make Constantinople look like the rural ass town I'm currently living in or playing wide and building a vast empire, your goals will ultimately be focused on conquest to some degree or other. You build up your economy and mana points to support your conquests, and diplomacy, bar some places like the HRE and North America prior to the rise of federations, is all about who you want to conquer right now, who you can save for later, and who you can make into your loyal subject and annex peacefully. You tech up to make more money and have better soldiers than your enemies, you manage alliances and royal marriages to ensure you have more soldiers than your enemies and have an heir (though personal unions can be an amazing reason to royal marry as many big nations as you can if you're Christian, they have no heir and won't when their king dies, and feel you can fight whoever the strongest nation that isn't you and is married to them is), you click through events, missions, and ideas to build up modifiers to help you with all these things and more. \n\nHowever, it is a game where nothing of interest can happen for a while and you'll oftentimes need to wait for a golden opportunity to strike, before anyone else can (or at least before anyone else sieges down all the provinces you want because you can't take them once they do, though Europa Expanded, which I'd highly recommend as your first mod - more on those later - has an amazing QoL feature allowing you to take occupations from your allies in a war in return for favors, which is hella useful if you're like me and just want to chill and let the AI do its thing sometimes, or your armies are having their asses handed to them and your allies are doing amazing in comparison.) As such, if you're the type who gets impatient waiting for things to happen, go play a unit-based RTS like Age of Empires or Command and Conquer where the waiting game is much less significant, or just don't play RTS games, I dunno.\n\n\n\nThe graphics are... Not the best, but this came out over 10 years ago now. As a consequence, it will run on literally anything that isn't a shitty craptop with RAM in the megabytes in 2025, and even then GeForce Now runs it handily in a pinch (though don't expect mod support at all.) The music is amazing, with some of it being orchestral pieces, some of being rock - hell, there's even a couple Sabaton DLCs if you're fans of theirs. There's a few DLCs for sound that are basically a podcast explaining the history of the region at the time if you're boring like that, too.\n\nSpeaking of DLC... Unless they come out with another Humble Bundle or something along those lines for it, or you're willing to do things that, for legal purposes, I am not going to name and dare not recommend you do in the presence of GabeN and our almighty moderator overlords, do yourself a favor and buy the subscription. I got everything up to Leviathan for about $30 or so through one, and still ended up spending over $100 on DLC to own every major expansion. The absolute must buys are now built in, and a few small DLCs that add a few events or song tracks are dirt cheap, but the game feels empty without the major DLCs and total conversion mods are going to crash unless you have all of them purchased and enabled because pretty much all of them rely on the DLCs for something or other.\n\nAs for mods... Europa Expanded should be your first, if you intend on playing modded real early. It's a vanilla plus mod that overhauls everything while still being true to the vanilla game, with real love and care put into it. Once you're used to the game (I started playing modded at around 600-700 hours or so? But you could easily start playing total conversions at 300 or so if you really don't like the start date as is) I'd move onto the big total conversions. Ante Bellum, Post Finem, and Gods and Kings are all ones I'd recommend. Then you can get into lesser known ones - check Chewyshoot (also the Post Finem head dev)'s channel, he regularly reviews mods and a lot of the total conversions are relatively new. Of course, though, I'm gonna be a bit of a shill for a moment and recommend my upcoming mod, Terra Nihil - a modern day/fantasy dystopian alternate history where alien empires that seek to effectively vassalize the Earth, cabals of magicians wanting to bring about a society of magic, cults hell-bent on bringing salvation to everyone, by force if they have to, megacorps that seek to make a profit at all costs, and gangs so massive they may as well be their own states rule the day. Smaller mods also exist, with things ranging from basic QoL, to graphical changes (ranging from changing the font of the text to making all the flags into anime girls), to translation mods, so if you're looking for something a bit more vanilla and EE isn't your thing, those exist too.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fun little time sink where you can conquer, colonize, and play out your wildest early modern era alternate history scenarios, EU4 is the game for you. If you're looking for something that's easy to learn or something you can just pick up and put down, though, you're better off looking elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1736836054, "timestamp_updated": 1736836054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185558065": {"recommendationid": "185558065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075810556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 215022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4255, "playtime_at_review": 214339, "last_played": 1737221370}, "language": "english", "review": "girl just play it", "timestamp_created": 1736833523, "timestamp_updated": 1736833523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185554905": {"recommendationid": "185554905", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132614978", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1187, "playtime_at_review": 2771, "last_played": 1737345239}, "language": "english", "review": "Great grand strategy game, but unfortunately weighed down with $375 worth of dlc with most of them being minor additions that should\u2019ve just been updates to the base game.

Little changes. You can still definitely enjoy game mechanics like with Vic2 or Vic3; Hoi2; Hoi3 etc.\n\nThe only paid add-on I've always kept up to was music/soundtrack. This game delivers with what you pay for. I mean, in Victoria, the mods are taking over and no one ever can ever charge you for an obsolete perfect Bach pipe organ musical or Chopin piano romantic music. (THX Paradox!). In EU you'll pay, but it's well worth it. VERY GOOD soundtrack. Little quirks, like Fredman's Epistles funny bits became a part of mine and my missus lives.\n\nAnyway. If you like strategies, like Transport Tycoon (OTTD); Civilisation (1,2,etc); C&C etc just buy the game. It'll take you a while to get it, but it's fine and the whole point of having it.\n\nI am a strange guy, dealing with moving vehicles. All my live I've been fixing aircrafts so Transport Tycoon or Transport Fever 2 or Workers & Resources are on my agenda but after all (maybe because of my interest in history & politics) I've ended up playing EUIV in my limited time.

The game has been tailored to be unbelievably hostile towards you, requiring tons of meta-gaming strategies and min-maxing just about every mechanic just to play the current state of the game, further reinforced by the newer content and DLC; It's intended for you to play with all these things in mind. It's essentially a tryhard competitive solo strategy game\n\nThere are also missions or unique functions that kind of break, as the way you were meant to obtain them is potentially nigh-impossible due to how key nations and great power AIs function now as well as the buffs and missions those nations have received\n\nYou should also note that the AI does in fact cheat and there is a bias towards you. Cheats are given to specific nations that were meant to represent their historical power, but they've instead become monstrous raidbosses to such unfathomable power that reduces your own agency and ability to control or set them against each other. Some of them are so powerful that they border on defying key mechanics\n\nIn summary, don't go in to this game because you want to roleplay and make your own history, setting your own borders and changing cultures or doing other things. This is gone by now.

As a Crusader Kings III player with hundreds of hours in that game, I thought I would be able to play and enjoy this one to the same degree... but I just can't. The game feels extremely dated in nearly every aspect. Here are some of the things that I feel like worsened my experience:\n\n1. WASD doesn't move the camera. You either have to use the arrow keys or mouse over the edge of the screen and there is no way to change this in the vanilla game.\n\n2. The game doesn't really support resolutions higher than 1920x1080. The buttons were so tiny you could barely see them on the default settings, and there isn't a way to scale UI-- I just had to select 1920x1080 and deal with some parts of the game looking unclear.\n\n3. The UI is clunky and unintuitive. There are nearly a dozen tabs that you have to be frequently clicking between, but to open them you need to first open the nation view menu before seeing those options. There are hotkeys, but the hotkeys only work if you opened the nation view menu first. Even when you get into the proper menu, the text in there is so small that it's hard to tell what you're clicking on or what is important when presented with a page full of numbers and symbols that weren't well-explained in the tutorial.\n\n4. The tooltips are hit-or-miss. While some tooltips display useful information, other times some tooltips don't really tell you that much or are completely nonexistent. For instance, in one specific event, I had the option to gain a claim on Gascony. Because I was unsure where Gascony was, I did what I would do in CK3 and clicked on the name to try to open a separate page on Gascony and see it on the map. Nothing happened. I moved the event panel to the side and started searching the area where I roughly thought Gascony was for the province named after it. Also nothing. It turns out Gascony is not a province, but rather a region, and therefore it wasn't labeled on the map, but by the time I figured that out I had already picked a different option that was more clearly explained.\n\n5. The popups get pretty annoying. Now, I know this must sound like a joke coming from a CK3 player considering how much that game uses popup events, but the main difference here is that I was getting popups about things happening in places that weren't my nation. Neighbor annexes a province? Pop up. Neighbor completes a decision? Pop up. Neighbor declares war on someone completely unrelated to me? Pop up. All of these things could be useful in very specific situations, so I see why having that information relayed to you is important, but why does it have to open a menu you have to click \"OK\" on? At least in CK3, full screen popups with things completely unrelated to you are rare, and they are primarily reserved for things that directly affect your character or nation. Other information, such as neighbors declaring or winning wars is still listed on your screen, but in a smaller log in the bottom right that doesn't force you to stop what you're doing and confirm you read it. Maybe there is a way to change this in-game, but I couldn't find that setting if there was one.\n\nI absolutely love the concept and time period of EU4, and the gameplay seems interesting, but I've found that it is impossible for me to enjoy it with just how dated, unclear, and clunky it feels. Unfortunately, issues like the ones I listed above are preventing me from liking it. Maybe it's a skill issue, and if clocked as many hours in this game as I have in CK3 I'd be used to working around all these issues, but I feel like getting to that point would feel like a chore to me.\n\nI don't think EU4 is necessarily a \"bad\" game, it just has some aspects in it that make it really unapproachable to a new player, even a veteran of other Paradox games. I think if you took the time to work through these issues, reorient yourself to the older controls, and accept that the game isn't going to give you all the information you need in-game, it could be enjoyable. But, I'd personally rather not spend my time forcing myself to play a game for a chance of having fun in the future when I could rather be playing games I'm certain I enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1736552082, "timestamp_updated": 1736560489, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185299393": {"recommendationid": "185299393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436466098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 136104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1347, "playtime_at_review": 134757, "last_played": 1737408465}, "language": "english", "review": "Good gaem", "timestamp_created": 1736550437, "timestamp_updated": 1736550437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185299293": {"recommendationid": "185299293", "author": {"steamid": "76561199750005081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 904, "playtime_at_review": 2061, "last_played": 1736894170}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, dont play it expecting it will be easy tho", "timestamp_created": 1736550354, "timestamp_updated": 1736550354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185297934": {"recommendationid": "185297934", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110158044", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3260, "playtime_at_review": 5717, "last_played": 1737347408}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever!!!

13012, "last_played": 1467172166}, "language": "english", "review": "Europa Universalis IV Review\n\nEuropa Universalis IV is a grand strategy game that immerses players in the intricate web of global history, diplomacy, and conquest. However, it comes with both remarkable strengths and notable drawbacks. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\nCons\nBottom-line Cost\nThe initial cost of the base game might seem reasonable, but to fully experience all the game has to offer, you\u2019ll need to purchase a significant number of DLCs. These expansions introduce essential features, mechanics, and content, making the base game feel incomplete without them. The combined cost of all the DLCs is steep, making it one of the most expensive games to fully enjoy. For new players, this can be a major deterrent, especially when compared to other games in the genre.\n\nToo Much Expensive DLC\nParadox Interactive, the developer, has a reputation for releasing frequent DLC packs. While these updates keep the game fresh and engaging for long-term fans, they create a barrier for new players. The sheer volume of DLC can be overwhelming, and the high price tags for each expansion make it difficult for players on a budget to access the full experience. Players often find themselves deciding between an incomplete experience or investing heavily.\n\nTedious to Learn\nEuropa Universalis IV is not a pick-up-and-play game. Newcomers are faced with an overwhelming array of menus, systems, and mechanics. Understanding diplomacy, trade, warfare, and internal politics requires patience and a willingness to research outside the game. Even the tutorials often fall short in adequately preparing players for the full experience. This can make the game feel more like work than entertainment at the start.\n\nVery Technical and Difficult to Manage\nOnce you begin playing, the depth of the game becomes both a blessing and a curse. Managing your nation involves monitoring countless details, from trade routes and alliances to troop movements and cultural unrest. For players who thrive on micromanagement, this is engaging, but for others, it can feel overwhelming. The technical aspects can lead to frustration when a single oversight spirals into a cascade of failures.\n\nSteep Learning Curve\nEven for seasoned strategy gamers, the learning curve is daunting. Mastering the game requires hours of trial and error, consultation of guides, and repeated playthroughs. Unlike many modern games that ease players in gently, Europa Universalis IV throws you into the deep end almost immediately, making it feel inaccessible for casual gamers.\n\nTakes Too Long to Finish a Game\nA single campaign in Europa Universalis IV can take dozens, if not hundreds, of hours to complete. While this is a testament to its depth, it also means that committing to a game is a significant time investment. For players with limited free time, completing a campaign is a challenge, potentially leading to frustration when progress feels slow or when real life interrupts gameplay.\n\nPros\nLearning About History\nEuropa Universalis IV is one of the most effective games for teaching history through gameplay. Players are introduced to real historical events, figures, and dynamics, such as the Protestant Reformation, the colonization of the Americas, and the rise and fall of empires. Even players with a casual interest in history will come away with a deeper understanding of the world's complex past.\n\nWatching History Unfold Before Your Eyes\nThe game\u2019s dynamic mechanics allow players to rewrite or mirror history. Watching the ebb and flow of nations as you guide your chosen country through centuries of global change is mesmerizing. Unexpected developments, such as the rise of a minor nation or the collapse of a major empire, make each playthrough unique and engaging.\n\nEngaging Gameplay\nDespite its complexity, Europa Universalis IV is deeply engaging once you understand its systems. Every decision feels impactful, and the game rewards strategic thinking and careful planning. Whether you\u2019re negotiating alliances, waging wars, or managing internal crises, there\u2019s always something demanding your attention and challenging your intellect.\n\nTransportative Experience\nFew games are as immersive as Europa Universalis IV. The detailed map, historical events, and intricate mechanics create a world you can lose yourself in. The game captures the feeling of being a ruler navigating a turbulent era, making it easy to forget you\u2019re playing a game and not orchestrating real-world history.\n\nOlder Game, but Still Holds Up\nOriginally released in 2013, Europa Universalis IV remains a benchmark for grand strategy games. Its consistent updates and community support have kept it fresh, and its depth and polish continue to outshine many newer titles. The game\u2019s longevity is a testament to its quality and the dedication of its developers and fans.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nEuropa Universalis IV is a game that rewards patience and dedication. It offers an unmatched historical strategy experience but demands a significant investment of time, effort, and money. For those who love history and deep strategy games, it\u2019s an essential title. However, casual gamers or those on a budget may find its barriers to entry too high to justify. If you\u2019re up for the challenge, Europa Universalis IV offers a journey through history like no other.", "timestamp_created": 1736455224, "timestamp_updated": 1736455224, "voted_up": true,

It is Grand Strategy very deserving of the word \"Grand\".\n\nI had played EU3 for several hundred hours before getting EU4, so I had a head start on mechanics and it still took several hundred hours to find all the mechanics possible and involved. I am very much relying on experiences and going similar routes so I might take longer to find everything, but I distinctly remember finding a mechanic after like 300+ hours of gameplay that would have solved issues I had hundreds of hours earlier. And I still enjoyed the earlier playthroughs.\n\nFor someone starting the game, do not be afraid of starting low (in terms of difficulty and country selection) and it can feel overwhelming, but especially in lower difficulty, even with little/ few things a lot can be accomplished, especially with some of the historically \"easier\"/ better situated countries. \n\nLearned about the family \"de Trast\u00e1mara\" only through this game and as someone interested in history, there is loooaaads in this game giving ideas what to look at and I have never found inaccuracies (unless in active gameplay as it's randomized to a degree). Not saying there are none, but they seem pretty rare at most.\n\nI don't even consider myself very drawn to these type of games or only to a certain degree, as they always have aspects too annoying for me to handle (as an example here: naval combat, colony warfare, wars against other competing nations). To be clear: I don't think it isn't well done, just too tedious for me to handle.\n\nI have seen many, many changes to the game as I have actively played it close to release and on and off until today and I would argue that in terms of realism, options and others it is today the best it's ever been. In terms of getting achievements it got \"worse\"/ harder in the very beginning. (Ryukyu anyone?) \n\nI have never liked not starting after the original starting point, partially because I am set in my ways when it comes to games, partially because when I did a couple of times, at the time the ideas the countries had, were more or less set in stone unless you wanted to lose a ton of progress and play catch up and not played a colony country or the pirates, not even really played through the Japan stuff and more.

Most of dlc's actually add a joke amount of content that's worth around 5-15hours of average modder work with a beer over a weekend, as a matter of fact, there are mods that add gigantic amount of content, that's beyond compare with what paradox adds.\n2. Price for these funny dlc's are actually enormous, most of dlc's is around 22 dolars on average in my country, 2-2 D O L A R S. And for those who is gonna say, yes but on sales you can buy each of them for 5 dollars - actually half of those dlc's are worth 5 dollars, not each one, and for the \"newer ones\" they actually don't go on sales, because why would they, it just add one mechanic, so pay these thieves for it, or you can simply buy some UltImAtE ExTrA bUnDlE that's around 40 dollars, to get whatever you don't have at the moment.\nAh, and just to be clear, my point of view on dlcs is simple, to charge 22 dollars for a dlc, make this dlc complex enough, to actually charge that 22 dollars, give something more, than what a modder can make over a weekend\n3. DLC Subscription - it's actually a joke, that you have to pay 10 dollars a month, to just have access to these shitty dlc's, no, it's not worth it, even I'm gonna say it, it's better to pay for that UlTiMAtE ExTrA bUnDlE. \n4. Game Engine - and this is what, I'm angry the most, because if you have paid your 200 dollars for dlc's or whatever amount you had to in your region, learned how to play and actually scale in the game, you might wanna play a bit longer, than 100 years in game (You even might to decide to actually play with your friend! However its irrelevant for this point), then you gonna realize real quick, that the game is pain to play after 1600(however, the better you are, as a player, quicker you will have problems with how laggy the game becomes, and I'm speaking as a owner of ryzen 7 5700 x3d, and rtx3070, so not too bad setup)\nAnd actually there is not a single one dlc, or any updates that comes with anything, that would help with how laggy the game becomes. \n\n\n\nSo as i have yapped enough, let's move to pros:\n\n1. The game is very complex, I have to admit that and if you are a new player, you are going to spend a lot of hours to learn mechanics, also those hidden in the game, overall it might at first reject some new players, as this game takes around 50 hours to play \"freely\"\n2. Very advanced scene of modders, there are actually a lot of mod's that gives you basically different game, can give you possibility to play in 900years+ or enchance graphics (with btw. paradox should take care of that, especially after looking at the prices of the dlc's)\n3. When you learn how to scale basically any country, it is really fun and rewarding.\n\nAnd what I'm not sure is a con, or pros, I'm gonna say, that game allows you to play with your friends, but prepare to a lot of desync and overall you can't play with speed higher than 3 and in the later stages of the game, you might even have to sometimes slow down to speed 2 (which is a disaster, taking into consideration that we have 2025).\n\nSo, if you are a new player that's wonder if it is worth buying, I recommend to wait for EU V, if we will have such game, because who knows, maybe paradox plans to add dlc's for another 5 years.\nIf you really want to try this game, wait for sales, try to buy any bundle that gives you all expansions dlc.", "timestamp_created": 1735927644, "timestamp_updated": 1735927968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072307109832764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184662801": {"recommendationid": "184662801", "author": {"steamid": "76561199551984489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5321, "last_played": 1736130846}, "language": "french", "review": "Certainement mon jeux favorie il est trep complet", "timestamp_created": 1735926695, "timestamp_updated": 1735926695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184658857": {"recommendationid": "184658857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023916071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 156130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "playtime_at_review": 156006, "last_played": 1737390159}, "language": "italian", "review": "Dopo 2600 ore di utilizzo ancora non vedo la lingua italiana.", "timestamp_created": 1735923769, "timestamp_updated": 1735923769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184652478": {"recommendationid": "184652478", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122550516", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1699643687}, "language": "english", "review": "outdated", "timestamp_created": 1735919899, "timestamp_updated": 1735919899, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184617874": {"recommendationid": "184617874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333636390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 62785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3130, "playtime_at_review": 59655, "last_played": 1737400604}, "language": "english", "review": "In one year, i wasted 1200 hours in this game, like almost 120 days in 360, got addicted very much like drugs, very reccomended (please help me, this is a sign for help)", "timestamp_created": 1735902246, "timestamp_updated": 1735902246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184617643": {"recommendationid": "184617643", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987974500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 139844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1428, "playtime_at_review": 138053, "last_played": 1737393818}, "language": "german", "review": "Schaut euch einfach meine Spielzeit an!

Having slavishly bought every DLC on release for the past god knows how many years, I've been with the game through the rough patches and the good patches and I can confidently say that EU4 is in a great spot and if you care even slightly about strategy games you should pick it up. The game seems to be winding down in development as work on EU5 is picking up, so if you haven't gotten into the Europa Universalis series it's a perfect time to hop on, as the game seems to finally be well and truly complete. \n\nEndless possibilites await you and no two games are the same. You're looking at a game where some crazy Swede said that you should be able to play any country (within reason, calm down liechtenstein enthusiasts) in the world from 1444-1821 and they actually walked the walk. Even the countries with the most barren content usually has fully unique or shared unique national ideas, unique government reforms, some unique culture and religious mechanics, leaving for a truly staggering amount of content. Even in the nations themselves there are usually several different routes to go down. If you somehow find yourself not knowing what to play or what to do, there are almost 400 achievements to hunt down and in classic paradox fashion they range from accomplishing some stupid whim that a developer thought of in the break room, to some genuinely crazy feats which you can then slap on your profile and feel proud of. \n\nIs the game perfect? No, the game has some pretty obvious flaws. Paradox' balancing team constantly throws darts at a board and impliments it into the game, leading to some pretty hilarious situations like humanist dodging the most well deserved nerfs to this very day. Hordes too are for some reason still as broken as the day they released, if not more so, and still Siam gets nerfed every other patch. The mission trees are fun to play around with, but if we're being honest it's just modifier stacking for doing stuff you're actually going to do in a normal playthrough. Modifier stacking has also gotten seriously crazy over the years, but it can be kinda hilarious at times so it's not a true downside.\n\nThe DLCs and the pricing is always a hot topic when it comes to paradox games, and this one is not exception. Truthfully there's way too many of them, and the pricing has gotten arbitrarily raised so I understand why people get angry about them, but I still buy them on release. Paradox is quite possibly the last AA game company left on the market and as much as I can grumble about the price, I also understand that they have to run a tighter ship than triple A companies. They do at the very least go on large sales very frequently, so they're easy to get eventually.\n\nI would be crucified if I didn't mention the modding scene, even if I feel like it shouldn't be mentioned in a review of the base game. There's mountains upon mountains of mods for this game and a lot of high quality stuff can be found on the workshop, so if you finally get bored of the base game after putting 173845 hours into the base game, rest assured that you can commit human rights violations in an alternate reality, or another world entirely. \n\nEU4 is the perfect game to waste 3000 hours, and then waste another 3000 hours for good measure.", "timestamp_created": 1735030990, "timestamp_updated": 1735030990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698039710521697998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183533306": {"recommendationid": "183533306", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247063462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 394, "playtime_at_review": 20444, "last_played": 1736737556}, "language": "english", "review": "After taking Two Tiles in Italy and or the HRE, i feel like Napoleon in 1813 \ud83d\ude4f", "timestamp_created": 1735009484, "timestamp_updated": 1735009484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183532660": {"recommendationid": "183532660", "author": {"steamid": "76561199559016986", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15973, "last_played": 1734848581}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game, Personally, some of the nations to play can be a bit tedious, especially if you don't really know what you're doing like me, but other than that, very fun game!", "timestamp_created": 1735008719, "timestamp_updated": 1735008719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183532074": {"recommendationid": "183532074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094585040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 73005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3350, "playtime_at_review": 64498, "last_played": 1737337290}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it.
