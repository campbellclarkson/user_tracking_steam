Proceeded to get shot to death by my evil twin while wrestling with an irate baboon and being pelted with rocks. Three thumbs up! (The third sprouted out of my chest when I gained a level. It just lives here now.)\n\nLonger review: If you've ever enjoyed the style of top-down CRPG popularized by things like Rogue, Nethack, Angband, etc., this one's a no-brainer. It's like any of those standard dungeon crawls had been transplanted to a bizarre far-future setting with actual lore and quality-of-life features, while losing none of the humor or difficulty. \n\nHumanity as we know it has ceased to be, leaving behind mutated remnants, wasteland wanderers, and cybernetics-worshipping transhuman cultists (these comprise the playable characters). The rest of the world is filled out by sentient plants and animals, exceedingly confused robots, monstrosities out of a fever-dream, and the ever-present hints of a great civilization to which Something Happened, once upon a time.\n\nWithin the first hour of gameplay I was intentionally ignored by a quest-giving NPC, who was more interested in muttering about electronics than in giving me work. I discovered that I had somehow achieved +300 reputation with the faction of Dogs, who will permit me in their holy places. This seems right and accurate. And, while wandering,  I found a hat covered in snails (which, evidently, grants +250 rep with all mollusks when worn). I've never yet met a snail in-game, but I am sure that this will come in useful someday. Better stick it in a box, though. Even leather armor rusts.\n\nThe crows are either trying to tell me secrets or they're out of their corvid minds. They're crows. It may be a little of both. I met an old hermit who greeted me with pleasantries and then proceeded to declare war on a day-glo cat for walking through his garbage pit. I conducted a sacred water exchange ritual with a weird old man, who then proceeded to teach me of the wilderness. My shoes make lizards like me. Plants, though? Nah. Don't even get me started on the qudzu. \n\nMy first run ended after several successful quests because I misjudged a location, stepped into a 4-layer pit, and trapped myself in a pool of salt-water with a bunch of giant, eyeless crabs. Up to then I thought I had been doing quite well.\n\nSuffice it to say: There are a lot of Rogue-like CRPGs on the market. There are NOT a lot of Rogue-like CRPGS that are THIS WEIRD.

What sets Qud aside though, is the fact that there's a main storyline keeping everything grounded and giving the player many handwritten adventures to pursue in-between, or as a main focus, their own unique adventure. Each playthrough tells a story of tragedy or triumph, and each playthrough can last anywhere between 30 seconds and 1,000+ hours.\n\nWhat's unique about Qud, and sorely missing from modern games that rely heavily on procedural generation (think Starfield, No Man's Sky, etc.), is that procedural generation in Qud doesn't *always* feel like procedural generation. Admitidly, sometimes it is obvious, like in the case of generated quests, but the player will come across generated people and creatures of legend, similarly legendary weapons and gear, and even locations with deep history and mysteries to discover completely unique to the singular playthrough - all of which mentioned is procedurally generated and VAST. There's gotta be an infinite amount of ways the world and its lore can be generated in this game.\n\nNot to mention the builds. Hitting the random button in character creation is the best way to play this game (as long as one is only playing permadeath) as pretty much every build is viable in some compacity and has their own challenges and playstyles. Character builds are just another thing that feel infinite and ever-changing. For those who want a more laid back playthrough, though, one can create their own character from scratch and play a gamemode with autosaving and more akin to the Elder Scrolls in terms of sticking to one character for a long period of time without the concern of permanently losing the character on death.\n\nWith a massive, sprawling and breathing world, turn-based combat mechanics that keep the player on the edge of their seats in heated and unfair battles, and infinite amount of storytelling capabilites, Caves of Qud is a game that I honestly believe should be played by everyone at least once. The price may seem expensive for this type of game (based off the screenshots, I guess) but in my opinion, there's hundreds of dollars worth of time and content here on an unprecedented level.\n\n11/10. One of the most mind blowing and rewarding games I've ever played where I never feel like I'm wasting my time.

This game is weird in the best possible way, offering an endlessly imaginative world packed with challenges and surprises around every corner.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to know is that Caves of Qud doesn\u2019t hold your hand. It throws you into a brilliant mix of predetermined and procedurally generated landscape and expects you to figure things out on your own. The game can be brutal\u2014whether you're in classic permadeath mode or roleplay mode, where the focus shifts to building relationships and navigating the complex world. Either way, every decision matters, and even the smallest misstep can lead to disaster. It\u2019s tough, but the satisfaction of overcoming its challenges makes it all worthwhile.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the game is how customizable your character can be. Want to sprout multiple heads or breathe fire? You can. Prefer to augment your PG's body with cybernetic limbs or parts? Go right ahead. The sheer amount of available mutations and cybernetic implants allows for a level of creativity in character building that\u2019s almost unmatched. These aren\u2019t just gimmicks\u2014they genuinely affect how you approach the game\u2019s challenges and interact with its strange world. And they can get you out of troubles much faster.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s graphical style might be a hurdle for some. It\u2019s minimalist (not as in the earlier version of the game, but still...) and text-heavy, relying on your imagination to bring its bizarre world to life. At first, I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d like it, but the more I played, the more I came to appreciate how much the simplicity lets your mind fill in the gaps. Over time, the game\u2019s environments, characters, and stories feel more vivid than anything hyper-realistic graphics could achieve.\r\n\r\nThe real heart of Caves of Qud is its world. It\u2019s richly layered with ancient ruins, sentient plants, bizarre creatures, and strange factions. Every area you explore feels like it has a history waiting to be uncovered. The writing is sharp and filled with personality\u2014it can be funny, tragic, or downright strange, sometimes all at once.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I barely scratched the surface of the game. I still don't know what to expect from the mid- and end-game. But I can't wait.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re the kind of player who loves experimenting, exploring, and embracing the unexpected, this game will hook you.

It is a really challenging and deeply thought out RPG with a unique vibe. The ambient music and the poetic language put a spell on me when I'm playing, and I can get lost for hours just delving into ruins and caverns. \r\n\r\nThere's a layer of joyful silliness over the whole thing, though the overall setting is hostile and dangerous; random things will happen that will tickle your imagination, you'll find generated texts that make you laugh out loud, a split-second decision will obliterate an entire town, or some absolute BS will kill you dead in one f****** turn.\r\n\r\nThis game is for fans of pulp science fiction and post-apocalyptic settings, with each new character bringing a generated history to uncover and fresh set of challenges. Mutated humans and cyborgs live alongside sentient plants, animals and robots, new cultures built in layers atop long-lost civilisations. The bow and sword-wielding knight you just made to take on the Salt Desert and Jungle Ruins could stumble across a bundle of Weird Tubes (equally likely to be a folding chair or a rocket launcher), an ancient library of nonsense, a colony of peaceful, sentient bugs, or in one case, a Legendary fish called Anus... All the while joined by your neo-pronoun-having sentient vine comedian friend. \r\n\r\nIt's sword and sorcery for people who love Mad Max and Fallout.\r\n\r\nThough the minimalist graphical presentation and flowery prose make the game seem impenetrable, the basics really are quite easy to grasp (with some practice). With the v1.0 release, there is a simple tutorial, the UI and control scheme has been simplified (with multiple options), and if you're afraid of losing a save in Classic mode, you can take on Roleplay Mode (with saving in settlements) or Wander (less hostile creatures). Taking the time to examine elements of the environment really lets you get a feel for what you're seeing on screen, and it gets my imagination running in ways other games don't.\r\n\r\nIt might take you longer than 2 hours to find the joy of it all, or it might click straight away, so it might be a gamble if you're prone to refunding stuff after trying it.

Some of those words might scare you, so it's worth unpacking. \n\nIt is a true roguelike in the sense that there is no metaprogression. You develop your gameplay by developing your understanding of the game world and mechanics. It is an RPG through-and-through. There is a strong, compelling central storyline, and many side quests and activities to carry you through. The campaign storyline will take you dozens of hours to complete your first go round, many of those hours spent carefully navigating hostile retrofuturistic maps filled with oozes, robots, mutants, and fellow explorers. As you play through the game, you will find yourself creating your own stories, quests, and content naturally, as any good open-world game tends to do.\n\nThe RNG is core to the game. More than anything else, Qud is a simulation. The RNG is not punishing, arbitrary, or punitive. You don't feel like you're getting hosed by dice rolls. Almost everything in the game world is randomized each time you play, from the locations of certain powerful enemies (with powerful loot to match), to the relationships between the NPCs you encounter along the way. The RNG keeps the game compelling and fresh, and makes every run exciting, and there are just enough fixed points in the world to give you familiar benchmarks and anchors to guide your play. \n\nThe magic of Qud to me, however, is in how these elements come together. You really feel like you can do almost anything in Qud. Sure, grab a sword, shield, and laser rifle and go through the great Salt Desert killing raiders and seeking caravans. Or sprout a few more arms than you'd expect and wield a half dozen laser pistols. That's fun, too.  But why not get weird with it? \n\nBecome a door by imbuing one with sentience with spray-a-brain and them dominating it with your psychic mutation. Convince an army of goats to follow you around, destroying any who cross you. Inhabit the mind of a leech and go slug it up in the deep jungle. Befriend two horses, name them Horse 1 and Horse 2, load them up with all your valuable loot, and gasp as you watch them both get sucked into different spacetime vortexes, transported to random locations anywhere in Qud taking your loot with them (ask me how I know that last one). \n\nThe turn-based gameplay is fascinating from a software engineering perspective. Each game turn advances the simulation a different amount depending on what the player did. The entire game is played from the perspective of the player, but the simulation takes different perspectives into account. Every creature has stats like Quickness and Movement Speed that determine how long it takes them to accomplish an action, and this interacts with your characters' own stats in interesting ways. Let's say you're dueling it out with a fellow scavenger in the salt desert. You both draw knives, but you distort time around you with your psychic mutations - meaning that you're getting two or three knife attacks in each time the hapless scavenger gets a single attack off. The game feels subtly different each playthrough depending on your build, even if you choose the same weapons. How powerful you feel very much depends not only on your build - but your enemies, and how their builds interact with yours. \n\nFrom a development and design perspective the game is a masterpiece. This is an obscenely polished piece of software. The aesthetic and art are simply stunning - the amount of feeling and depth the team's artists gave everything from tiles to two-headed hogs using only a few pixels is incredible. The music is exactly what it should be - compelling and enhancing, informative and rich, but not overbearing. The game mechanics work together in intuitive ways that not only allow, but encourage and foster, spontaneous discovery. If you think two things should work together a certain way - they probably do. And it's probably hilarious. The modding community is thriving and embraced by the devs. This is a game made with love by people who love games.\n\nQud is truly unique.

There are some things you should know before purchasing. Browsing through the positive Steam reviews, there is a lot of undeserved praise which I feel the need to dispel.\n\nThis game is like playing DnD under a dungeon master (DM) who has one campaign with the same main quest and same main characters and same world map and same key items etc every time. These elements are NOT procedurally generated. The only procedurally generated elements are minutiae that you wouldn't care about anyway-- like random dice rolls, and the specific layout of battle areas, number of enemies, etc. The same enemies are encountered in the same locations in the world, and their loot tables are pretty rigid. Even the locations that the main quest-givers send you to are the same, and even the important encounters in those areas are the same. Heck, the DM even set things up so that you will likely contract a disease (\"glotrot\") from a specific place during a specific quest. Even that level of detail is micromanaged. Would you enjoy playing under such a DM? \n\nThe game design is internally strained. It's trying to sell a replayable roguelike experience when all it has to work with is a single campaign. That might have been possible, but the details which matter are railroaded. You're expected to memorise where all the traps are, literally and figuratively, and to account for them next time. You're expected to get through this DM's campaign no matter how many times you have to try. And don't go thinking you can come at it with your own playstyle or role play in this role-playing game, no no no! For my first run, I chose to be a psychic merchant. I had plans to travel the world and accumulate expensive gadgets and equipment through trade, and to recruit bodyguard companions. Turns out that it's not actually a viable option to play a character with a low Toughness stat-- you will get one-shotted by things in the starting area in a way that is completely outside your control (even if you proceed gingerly!). And for some [i]terrible[/i] reason, the player is treated as the centre of the world: enemies will almost always make a beeline for you, even if you have three companions. The enemy AI is primitive, and this makes this play style untenable.\n\nGoing into it, I thought this game was about role-play, lore and a narrative-rich world. Bzzt. No it isn't. The lore is procedurally generated garbage-- it often doesn't even have correct grammar. It's like reading bad fiction from someone who wants to sound smart so they use lots of big words they've heard before without knowing their meanings (or in some cases, whether they're a noun or a verb etc.).\n\nSince role-playing is not a real option, this just leaves the roguelike elements, combat and 'instrumental play'. Well then, you should know that some starting mutations are just better than others, and not to waste your time on psychic abilities. Why? Because if you spec into melee, then you can use your raw strength every single turn without a cooldown (attacking with a melee weapon). If you spec into psychic abilities, then you need to wait... something like 50 or 100 turns between attacks! That is just as unplayable as it sounds. Also, the inventory management is really tedious. It takes way too many clicks / keystrokes to do simple things. \n\nBut this isn't a great roguelike either. In roguelike games, you're supposed to have the opportunity to choose between alternatives as a way for the player to exercise their agency and build a strategy based on the random elements of the run. For example, giving the player a choice between three items. In this game, that role is accomplished by \"unidentified trinkets/artefacts\". However, they are [i]unidentified[/i] in stores, so you can't know what you're choosing. That's flawed game design. (One exception: you can ask Tinker merchants to identify their items first, but that is not-at-all obvious in the UI.) And the most important items (like mechanical wings and \"recoilers\") are in fixed locations or are predictable/manipulable so that you can reliably obtain them. \n\nThe game is also a bit buggy: I checked the option to only colour character sprites according to their damage taken, but this setting is not respected. Then there are enemies that are \"hostile\" but won't actually attack the character. \n\nSo what is this game? Who is it for? The game isn't designed properly as a roguelike. But it isn't a great role-playing game either because it isn't balanced to allow the full gamut of play styles which it supposes to accomodate in the character creation menu. I don't know who this is for. It is one of the most bizarre games that I have played. Unfortunately, I don't mean that in an entirely positive sense.\n\n-----\n\nI don't mind magniloquent writing when it's done well. If I have to look up words and I find the writing satisfying, then great. Unfortunately, I think the various descriptions in this game are just bad writing. I think it's generated by a large language model with minimal oversight.\n\n- Description of an enemy called a twinning lamprey: \"A ribbon of scaleless tissue quivers in suspension beyond a mouth ringed with repeating triangle teeth. It extrudes a double through the mirrored planes of reality.\"\nThis looks like an eel-like enemy. Why would you say the body of the eel is \"beyond\" the mouth? That implies that the mouth comes first in some way. That doesn't make sense. And what does it mean to extrude \"a double\", let alone \"through the mirrored planes of reality\"?\n\n - Description of an enemy called a plastronoid: \"Chrome rondures sling themselves along the orbital paths of an invisible magnetic gyroscope. By inscrutable intervals, one pops out the transverse plane with violent momentum.\"\nI think that should say \"at\" inscrutable intervals, and \"its\" transverse plane. Not to mention the other problems with this.\n\n - Description of an enemy called a snailmother: \"Out a pristine shell of rolling citrine, frozen azure, and polished jade, the goopy neck cranes straight up and loosens a throbbing egg from her gelatin clutch.\"\nAfter looking words up, it turns out that \"citrine\" in noun form refers to a yellow-coloured variety of quartz, and \"azure\" is an obsolete way to refer to lapis lazuli (a blue-coloured mineral). What does it mean for the citrine to be \"rolling\", or the azure \"frozen\"? Why is the jade polished specifically but not the other two minerals? Here's a better description I'm writing on-the-spot: \"This mollusc is housed by a multicoloured shell of minerals: orange, blue and green.\"\n \n- Description of an enemy called a Mechanimist rummager: \"His hunch-back is meadowed in tattered robes the color of slate. Strands of matted chin hair splay against his chapped lips, and his eyes dart at nearish trinkets.\"\nAccording to the Webster's 1913 unabridged dictionary, \"meadow\" is not a verb. And if it is to be used as one, then tell me what it means for a hunch back to be meadowed in tattered robes. This is nonsense. Now the sprite doesn't show the mechanimist having a hunch-back whatsoever, so this description is just false. Also it says \"strands of matted chin hair\". Is it just a few strands or is it so much that it's capable of being matted?! It makes no sense. And how can chin hair splay against the lips? That seems implausible. Also the mechanimist has no visible hair: he looks to be wearing a mask and hood. Maybe that should have been mentioned in the worded description?", "timestamp_created": 1736352508, "timestamp_updated": 1736458014, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530695140361785889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185110724": {"recommendationid": "185110724", "author": {"steamid": "76561199051974122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 483, "playtime_at_review": 1107, "last_played": 1737323373}, "language": "french", "review": "jeu vraiment bien.

Will you use so much psychic energy as a mutant that an inter-dimensional being is alerted to your presence?\n\nWill you be a cybernetic pure blood or a mutated human with sensory bulbs growing from your face?\n\nI could keep going, but this game is packed with a bunch of random but awesome emergent stories and events.

In theory it's right up my alley. It receives a ton of praise from the oldschool roguelike enthusiasts and supposedly has really good writing.\n\nI like a lot about the game. I like the world, I like the music, I like the themes and I like the setting. It has a ton of really cool stuff and tons of ways to \"break\" it with clever thinking. You can swap bodies with creatures, bypass large quests to acquire early power, clone items and even yourself. There's dozens of hours of content with several different builds or playstyles for you to enjoy. But honestly?\n\n[h3]It's just so incredibly boring and tedious[/h3]\nThe [b]constant[/b] Inventory management. The caves and ruins that overstay their welcome by nearly 10-20 floors, the never-ending interruptions on the worldmap that force you to wander around killing trivial enemies for 5 minutes at a time. It's all so incredibly tedious. I am perpetually in a state of doing things that I do not want to do just to actually accomplish my desired goal at any point in time.\n\nYes, a lot of what I just listed can be avoided or mitigated by just adjusting how you play the game. Don't like the loot management? Simply loot less stuff. You don't \"need\" money so the constant looting isn't necessary. Don't like how long ruins/caves are? Simply do not enter them. The worldmap? There's a skill and some items that can improve that.\n\nHowever it just feels so incredibly backwards. The game presents me with things that I should want to do, and then makes them feel bad to actually interact with. Then it provides me with tools or realizations that solve those problems. I should [b]want[/b] to explore ruins. I should [b]want[/b] to loot items. But the game makes me hate doing that and essentially tells me to turn those features off.\n\nMany of the endgame areas and enemies are also extremely unfun to fight against. The zones are a very clunky maze that requires tons of backtracking and circling around to actually progress in. There are almost no enemies either making the entire area a massive slog. You could try and dig through the walls but then you'll spawn evil clones of yourself that are essentially guaranteed to kill you. When you finally [i]do[/i] see a normal enemy, it's something with an impenetrable forcefield that has infinite armor and can only be killed with a very specific strategy. What's that, your character doesn't want to use EMP grenades and disintegration tactics? [i]Then you simply aren't going to be killing this enemy.[/i]\n\n[h3]The game has [i]Horrendous[/i] Pacing[/h3]\nEarly game you are very weak and very easily killed. It takes a few runs to just get a character stable enough to survive to actually start the main story. Once you do though, you're almost guaranteed to succeed because power creep is out of control. By the time you reach the midgame you are likely already well on your way to being an unstoppable god, and have completed all of your desired character progression.\n\nThen you get to the endgame and they're like, we need to you explore around the highest level areas and acquire components so that we can craft you an unstoppable companion that will be with you for the rest of the game! Like brother I don't need that just let me fight the big bad guy or whatever. This is the kind of quest that would have been perfect in the earlier stages of the game but are just so unnecessary by that point that it feels like an massive chore.\n\nQud just has too much \"fluff\" content that takes up your time--and when you finally get to the \"good parts\" you're already mostly checked out. As crazy as it sounds for a game like this, the experience would have been [i]significantly[/i] better if it was linear and more railroaded.\n\n[h3]There are almost no interesting encounters[/h3]\nDespite unique enemies and legendary creatures existing, there is almost nothing that feels like an actual \"boss fight\" or something that puts the culmination of all of your character progression on the line. There are no tense moments, no strategic use of your abilities to maximize your combat potential for a tough enemy.\n\nYou press the same buttons you always press, in the same order you always press them, and you win. Easily.\n...unless it's the random pyramid enemy in a high level area. Then you throw your build in the trash and use the exact same character-agnostic \"tactic\" that everyone uses, get nothing for your trouble, and then move on with your day.\n\nThere's no special unique items that change how your character plays, and there isn't any [i]need[/i] for them either because nothing actually challenges you. It's just not interesting.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nI think caves of qud has the bones of something good. It has a ton of really solid mechanics and cool interactions between them. There's fun ways to break it and in theory there are fun ways for it to break you. The soundtrack is great and there's a palpable sense of wonder and mystery about nearly everything in the world. But the game is bogged down by poor pacing. It is bogged down by poor balance. It is bogged down by tedium.\n\nThere are a couple of mods that can drastically improve your experience with this game (namely anything that removes inventory weight and adds new content), but it's honestly just not enough.

It's definetely not a case of \"wide as an ocean, shallow as a puddle\". Rather... let me give the example that made me choose to quit.\n\nI was facing a dungeon of my level, that NPCs recommended to get some cold resistance for. Unfortuantely, no aspect of the game actually tells you how you can get that resistance, so I went in with what little I had. After facing a boss that was weirdly overpowered for what was supposed to be my level and cheesing it by spending a hundred turns gunning at it from a distance it wouldn't respond to, I eventually made it to a floor harboring two special types of enemies in paticular.\nOne had a freeze ray that seemed to be a guaranteed hit that would stunlock you for a good 60 rounds (less with that cold resistance I still don't know how to get), which is several times more than enough time for it to just walk up and nibble you for a guaranteed death.\nThe second came in pairs, and if you kill one, the other instantly respawns it at full health. To defeat it, you must either kill both in the same turn (requiring you to finagle them to low health and finish them with an AoE, which you may simply not have), or use Normality Gas on them (which is a very specific thing you probably don't have), or stun one with other specific abilities or consumables you very well may not have. The game threw 20 of them or so at me, with no information on which are paired up, or any ingame way to know any of the above. I had to wiki and savescum to stand a chance (and did not, because it was 20 and the \"you are immune to harmful gases\" aspect of my helm mysteriously is useless against stun gas grenades)\n\nBetween stuff like that, certain enemies being able to straight up remove limbs permanently on hit, and the damage mechanics allowing for unlikely extreme spikes of damage, I'm suprised this is typically played as a roguelike. Even the \"roleplay\" mode where you can save in towns can easily have deaths undo an hour of progress or more, which you are *unable* to get back as the places you were at are rerolled - sometimes into nonexistance.\n\nIt takes a specific kind of person to enjoy a game that can undo loads of progress on a whim like this, with nothing to show for it except maybe knowing what the BS smells like for next time so that you can cheese it before it cheeses you.", "timestamp_created": 1736033437, "timestamp_updated": 1736034398, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612142086029052734", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184785528": {"recommendationid": "184785528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023154791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 962, "playtime_at_review": 1758, "deck_playtime_at_review": 1752, "last_played": 1737316554}, "language": "english", "review": "Thirty bewildering hours in, and having barely scratched the surface of the systems and stories packed into this game, I can already confidently say that this is one of my favorite games ever.

Created a character using the daily run option on the last day of 2024. [i]Note: mild spoilers below.[/i]\n\n[h2]How it started[/h2]\nMy profession is tinkerer and I started with very little combat proficiency, but a mutation allowing me to clone myself. Early on I figured out that by keeping my inventory stocked with grenades, essentially every time I was in a pinch I could create a clone and run the other direction, hoping not to get caught in the barrage of acid, ice, and fire. Best of all, [i]real me[/i] keeps the grenades. Definitely got frozen by [i]other me[/i] a few times.\n\nEventually realized that my physical mutation -- horns -- was more powerful than most of my other weapons so I started leaning into that and seeing real success in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nOne day as I was journeying through the hills, I encountered a cave that was not only deep, but incredibly expansive. I spent literal days exploring it and got tons of experience and items, really started settling into a rhythm. Eventually I realized -- I had no idea how I was going to get out of this place. Then, as I was descending yet another level, I ran into the most difficult encounter yet. In the middle of it was a spacetime vortex. I said screw it, entered the vortex and got teleported to an isolationist settlement of centaurs.\n\n[i]unspoilered: I did something awesome and unexpected at the centaur village.[/i]\n[spoiler]Now, normally these druids disallow outside visitors but they were right in the middle of unraveling a heist and needed help from \"kendren\", or people like me. I said hell yes I'll solve your mystery. After a very real and professional investigation, I pinned the blame on their despot which overthrew the incumbent government and installed a democratic leader. Queue me riding off into the sunset.[/spoiler]\nI felt like such a badass.\n\n[h2]Disaster strikes[/h2]\nAs I was journeying home to turn in my original quest, I felt a tickle in my throat..... and then my tongue rotted and fell off.\n\nIt is not hyperbole to say this is catastrophic. I could no longer parlay with local leaders, I could only trade at a serious disadvantage, and worse yet I consumed water (the in-game currency) at about 10x the usual rate as drinking would often cause me to unceremoniously upchuck this most precious resource.\n\nI was at a loss for what to do. Nothing else mattered from this point forward; my only goal from here was to try and salvage this run (did I mention death is permanent?) by curing my glotrot and regrowing my tongue. Home would have to wait. After changing course eastward and finding an apothecary, I somehow scrounged together enough dough (read: water) to buy a crash course on healing every sickness under the sun and was able to mix myself a cure for the disease itself. And that was the easy part.\n\nYou see, once your tongue has fallen off your options for growing a new one are quite limited. You can either attempt to brute force your way into a *very* dangerous area where a city exists that can allow you to regrow limbs, or you can try to purchase an exceedingly rare tonic that, when applied, will regenerate one single limb.\n\nI searched for *days* to try and find any merchant selling that tonic. I traveled to every caravan I knew of, every village and city, and nobody had it on offer. Regardless, I probably wouldn't have been able to afford it given how much water I wasted by simply existing. Thus, out of other options, I began making my way toward that perilous settlement that promised the possibility of healing. \n\nAs I traveled there, I stumbled across some ruins containing scant more than a single chest. In that chest was the tonic I needed. I couldn't believe it.\n\nLet me tell you, the feeling of satisfaction as I finally dispensed that tonic into my bloodstream and regrew my tongue -- I wish I could bottle how that felt. There are few moments in gaming that I can recall feeling so triumphant. I was BACK! After all that misery, I could finally speak to people again, sell my wares, and resume my quest!\n\nAs I started heading home once again, I got into a tussle with a lumberjack robot and it [b]cut my arm off.[/b]\n\n\n\n[h2]Closing thoughts[/h2]\nSo yeah, that's where I'm currently at with this run. I'm about to dive in and play some more. I'll probably find this review in a few years and remember just how awesome it was to finally understand the appeal of games like this.\n\nIf you're a fan of games that allow emergent storytelling you're going to be hard-pressed to find one more effective at it than Caves of Qud. It took me a [i]really[/i] long time (originally purchased the game in 2018 I think?) to \"see the matrix\" so-to-speak, but after getting used to the presentation the game is truly astonishing for its scope and depth. Also, no two runs ever feel whatsoever similar which is a feat on its own.

Let me explain.\nMy character (a cyborg swordsman named Ruvrin) was on his way to the Six Day Stilt when he got lost in the desert, as often happens in this game. I was immediately ambushed by an army of Isaachari raiders. After easily wiping them all out with my blade, I entered the lair they were protecting. As I turned a corner, confusion seized me and I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of what was happening around me at all. In my periphery, though, I saw a legendary Isaachari called Flays-in-Oil step forward, throwing slime or some similar substance at me. \n\nThe confusion continued and extended by several turns. Another Isaachari emerged and stabbed me, while Flays-in-Oil dual wielded two bronze daggers, dogpiling the damage on. I finally got the hint it was time to run and sprinted away, up the stairs and back out to the desert. With time the confusion dissipated and I took out the lackey first. Then, Flays-in-Oil followed me into the desert.\n\nI tried to lose him, but he wouldn\u2019t give up easily it seemed. So I decided to get creative and go toe to toe with him, not knowing how to deal with the confusion at all since I was new to the game. The more expansive terrain seemed to help me dodge his confusion attacks (the cramped corridors of his hideout were dangerous because you couldn\u2019t really evade the confusion there).\n\nThe ensuing fight between us seemed to go on for in game days. It was a lengthy struggle, only because I realized a sphynx injector on me could help even the playing field for a few moments. That, and healthy use of the sprint mechanic gave me brief openings to get the confusion to wear off, and do damage to Flays-in-Oil. I noticed every time he confused me, the weird substance he threw at me trailed on the ground. By the end of the fight, we were surrounded by massive pools of it in the middle of the desert. I realized that they call him Flays-in-Oil for a reason, which was a fun detail to take in once it dawned on me. I barely survived, and when I landed the killing blow, believe me when I tell you it was the best moment in gaming for me this year. All of this, by the way, did not seem procedurally generated--but it was, which is nuts.\n\nAnd there have been many other noteworthy randomly generated moments in Caves of Qud since then\u2014once, I infiltrated a legendary cannibal\u2019s lair, and used Rebuke Robot to hack his Drillbot before directing it to massacre him and all his lackeys.\n\nAnother time, a village of dung loving dragonflies who had overthrown their dung hating mayor in favor of a scheming crocodile, and who had desecrated statues of the old mayor all over the town after he was overthrown (hilarious), tasked me with stealing a salt mill from a pig farmer. I went to the farm, freed the pigs to distract the farmer, and stole the item from his storage, then gave it to the crocodile as requested. So he could rest on it and use it for warmth, or something to that effect, he said.\n\nDid I mention that this game also has an incredibly well done, pre-made main questline in addition to all this?

That might seem a bit much, but I've found Qud veils its vast depths in a mystery that's both enticing & rewarding to learn about slowly, with repetition. Unlike Morrowind, no matter how overpowered you feel your character is, even if you're confidently triple-wielding matter-disintegrating particle rifles and able to bend spacetime to your will, there always seems to be some cosmic horror or sentient chrome pyramid out there that can humble you in a single misstep. It may be frustrating to have a really good run come to an end, but every new run comes with the possibility of discovering more OP combinations and hilariously fortunate (or unfortunate) situations. And if you really just can't get over losing your progress that often, you're given the option to play the game with checkpoints, or without combat at all. Did I mention that Qud plays *amazingly* on a controller? It's truly a marvel how the devs managed to fit all the keybinds you'd need into a gamepad layout! It feels even more convenient than the original numpad control scheme, and I almost exclusively play with a controller now. \n\nGive Qud a shot.

Like ADOM, but better. Most of these developers never released anything... instead, eventually a counter-movement happened to actually release something, so we got lots of shorter roguelikes, focused on balance, which are great in their own right, but something was missing.\n\nCaves of Qud is like these old dreams, but successful. Very complex. Very epic. Lots of similarities to roguelike classics (the general structure similar to ADOM, figuring out devices like in Alphaman). Amazing worldbuilding and writing. Hopefully it will inspire a new wave of great roguelikes.\n\n(Edit: something is buggy with Steam playtime counting. When I originally wrote this review, Steam said I have played it for 52 hours which looks accurate, but then it changed to 32 minutes and the review also said that time. 3 hours of playing later Steam said 55 hours, I edited the review to explain that the playtime was inaccurate, and now it says 3 hours.

In fact, it might be one of the purest RPGs made, if you look at the roots of the genre as \"putting a tabletop RPG experience in your computer.\" Many people call it a roguelike, but the similarities are very surface-level. Much of the important stuff in the game is not randomly generated and follows standard RPG fare: a campaign (or \"main quest\"), the general layout of the overworld, the locations of major... locations. You have very standard stats and skill systems (though the skills themselves can be very unique), inventory management is done with weight instead of slots, managing hunger (thirst in this game) is trivial, identifying items is very different than in Rogue, and so on. The game takes inspiration from Rogue, since it was one of the original \"put RPG on computer\" games, but it does not actually subscribe to its design. If you are not familiar with, used to, or a fan of roguelikes, do not let that stop you from playing this game. Once you get used to the controls, everything else is much closer to a classic RPG than anything.\n\nThe next thing to understand is that Qud is an OUTSTANDING RPG. Even without considering the procedural generation, it's a very good experience. The unique setting makes the game very hard to put down; you always want to keep exploring and keep making progress in the main quest to find out more. The writing in the game is a bit flowery at times, but very descriptive and does well to flesh out the world (be sure to Look at everything and everyone and check their descriptions!). The systems of the game are very well balanced, and often have little twists that make you think a bit more than you normally would. Every stat is relevant to any build to some extent. Bartering is done with water, which you need to drink, and which is also considerably heavy, making buying and selling items much more involved than other games. The combat skills you can get are extremely varied, and you can play for a long time just trying different ones and seeing what you can do with them. Siding with factions can get you information, including locations of interest, skills, and recipes, but befriending one group may make another your enemy. Information itself is a currency of sorts that you gather by exploring, and you have to decide carefully who you share it with. It is a little magical how the mechanics and the setting work together so well.\n\nThe final thing to understand is that the \"roguelike\" elements that are in the game exists to boost the RPG experience into a whole new level. Permadeath is a very core aspect of this game. A very significant part of the RPG experience comes from having to put effort into surviving, and actually fearing death. The random generation exists to make the permadeath actually enjoyable. Your main quest may be the same, but the details along the way can vary wildly. Dungeon layouts, quests, the history of the world, the relationships between factions (including you), what legendary items exist and what exactly they are, and more vary wildly. Hell, just the normal items you find at merchants or in dungeons can differ enough to provide varied experiences. The game is constantly throwing new situations at you and asking \"what would you do?\", which is exactly what an RPG should be doing.\n\nI know this ruins the three part form of this review, but there is one last thing that has to be mentioned that won't fit into any of the other parts. The character creation system is extremely powerful, and it beautifully marries the RPG elements and the \"roguelike\" elements together. You are given an absolute smorgasboard of choices when creating your character. For instance, all 70+ mutations in the game are available at the start. This helps greatly soften the blow of death. If you are the kind of person who views the game as a challenge to beat, each run is a chance to experiment and optimize your build. If you enjoy roleplaying, you can create all kinds of non-standard characters or themed characters and see how their lives play out. You could opt to randomize certain aspects of your character, and enjoy playing with the hand you're dealt. Hell, go back and forth between playstyles to keep things even more fresh. And if none of that sounds appealing to you, somehow, despite my preaching, that's okay; there is a non-permadeath mode that is still tons of fun, because the game is still a really damn good RPG without it.", "timestamp_created": 1735638836, "timestamp_updated": 1735638836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552390635013580322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184311941": {"recommendationid": "184311941", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968598435", "num_games_owned": 2504, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 4734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4449, "last_played": 1735866940}, "language": "english", "review": "I found a clone of myself cryogenically frozen underground, freed them, and tried to amputate their face so that I could wear it on my own face (it's for an achievement, ok?).

Deep and addictive gameplay mechanics with some identity issues that prevent it from being ONE OF THE GAMES OF ALL TIME. \n\n[i]I bought this on sale during the 1.0 launch, so all of my thoughts are in the here and now. I never knew this game prior to launch, which is what YOU THIS PERSON LOOKING TO BUY needs to hear![/i]\n\nAlright\u2026 So this game looks ugly at first glance. You thought it was weird, I thought it was bad, and my friends judge me harshly whenever I talk about it. But there's something actually magical that happens the more you play it. Whoever made this game is absolutely a back-end software developer who has a repressed gift for UI design. \n\nWhen you play this game for an hour, the UI just naturally grafts into your eyes and transposes to your muscle memory. It's incredible\u2026 \n\nWhich brings me to the first of only a few criticisms. \n\n[h2]#1 - It Hurts to Move Sometimes... [/h2]\n\nThe controls in this game don't naturally run with WASD, which genuinely screws with my comfort play. You have full control of it. It's not that big of a deal. \n\n[h3]My biggest issue with this game is what seems to be it's identity crisis. [/h3] \n\nI'd wager a guess that someone built this as a small-time rogue-like. They then continued to have PROFOUND IDEAS OVER AND OVER to the point that they had developed one of the most fascinating RPGs I've ever seen. \n\nThe problem is, the rogue-like elements are DIRECTLY AT ODDS with the RPG elements\u2026 But it's still not that big of a problem. Hear me out! Let's break it down!\n\n[h2]#2 - Harsh-Browns Everyday and You Won't Know Why[/h2]\n\nYou're going to get REKT NERD because you face-checked a world tile and didn't realize that you landed in a swamp that has some freaking piranha eel that legit just eats your limbs. \n\nYou're also going to continuously die in a place called Golgotha (Jesus died there and the fact that he rose again in spite of it has evolved/mutated my faith) and you'll question WHY DID I JUST DIE BRO?! *Involuntary Desk Slam!*\n\nThis game has had more \u201cdesk slamming\u201d moments than freaking Tarkov bro. And I've played Tarkov for over 5 years! \n\nI die often and feel like I don't learn anything other than, \u201cthat thing can and will ruin my life\u201d. In Dark Souls, the secret \u201clevel-up\u201d is that you learn a little every time you die. You understand their movements a little better, you know what worked, and you're a better player almost every time you die. This is not always the case in Qud.\n\nIf you're going serve me harshbrowns every time I sit down at a location, teach me something man. I legit walked up to a freaking two headed Chuchu from Zelda and went from 60/150 to DEAD. What did I learn? I dunno but the logs were not conclusive. \n\nMaybe I should've just looked the creature up on the wiki\u2026 But that brings me to my next complaint. \n\n[h2]#3 - Communication is Healthy and Necessary in Every Marriage, Don't be a Silent Rogue [/h2]\n\nBro\u2026 Don't freaking give me a talking fungus on my back and then not give me solutions. Don't chop off my feet in a disagreement with a woodchipper bot and then ask me to hike back without a solution. \n\nThere are ROGUE-LIKE things that happen to you in this game, but Qud doesn't talk to you about them.\n\nIn-game, Qud won't shut up about it's beautifully crafted world, deep character design, fascinating relationship systems, weird item systems, and wacked out races. And that's great for it. That's where you'll fall in love with Qud. \n\nQud looking hella cute today eh? You know you wanna put a ring on it. \n\nSo you spend countless evenings together, maybe stay up a little too late exploring\u2026 So you get married and commit to playing this game over the recent Tarkov wipe/tragedy or Marvel Rivals that you friends keep begging you to play. It's been weeks since you've seen your bros, and you're okay with that for now. It's the HONEYMOON PHASE with this game.\n\nBut then Qud won't freaking talk to you. Dang she's beautiful and she's so fun, but SHE WON'T TELL YOU WHY YOU HAVE A FUNGUS ON YOUR BACK OR HOW TO DEAL WITH IT! \n\nLittle did you know\u2026 You were supposed to go to just the right location, talk to just the right person, and read the right book. I have nothing against reading, I actually really enjoyed that part. It was getting to the book that annoyed me. \n\nI had to go and look at the wiki in order to get to the conclusion. And GOD KNOWS I do enough of that in Tarkov. That crap is an abusive relationship bro. I married Qud because I didn't want to have to do that\u2026 I wanted a healthier relationship than that.\n\nI should've been able to go to the doctor-esque person in the first town and strike up a natural conversation about the fungus or the missing limbs. And that's actually what I originally did, because the game is SO DEEP that I thought that would've happened. I would've been down if she gave me a hint to the book or something, I would've been totally fine with that. But being silent about an armless, fungus-covered doofus isn't something this game should do. \n\nJust communicate with me on these random rogue-like things. Because taking away an entire item slot can absolutely ruin my fun. And that's where a few rogue-like elements are still lingering to try and ruin what is one of the best RPGs I've ever played.\n\nThere's one *SPOILER* of a disease that literally ruined my progress in that fascinating story. Not once did one of the characters look at me and say, \u201cDang bro, I knew a guy that this happened to. I saw that same guy set a canteen on fire and drink it. It was NUTS!\u201d\n\n[h1]I Still Love You... Qud... [/h1] \n\nAlright I've ranted enough. This game is great. I love it. I think it's genius. \n\nWe just need to continue growing together in this relationship and find our identities TOGETHER. I believe in you Qud.

While on a micro-scale, on-the-spot generation of local zones circumvents a common CRPG drawback by making familiar locations just unfamiliar enough to remain exciting and fresh, on a macro-scale the spontaneity ingrained in the roguelike genre is scarcely found. Character-altering options that would be exciting in the context of a different game just aren't as appealing to a character that has been extensively planned and steadily built up for 30 hours. Similarly, permanent death is quite a divisive inclusion as while it instills the necessary tension for each situation to be taken seriously, it also just feels bad losing a character to a single lapse of judgment, or worse, to something completely unforeseen.\n\nIn a recent video titled 'Designing Caves of Qud', co-creator Jason Grinblat states that: \"Caves of Qud is unique among RPG-type games in that it is driven by a complex physical, social and historical simulation, and this is what really sets it apart. Those simulation elements allow the RPG elements and tactical gameplay to flower on top of deep and colliding systems.\"\n\nThe reputation system's effect is a significant boon to the variety of engagement with virtually all of the regions and enemies in the game, but interacting with the system itself introduces a damaging degree of repetitiveness. The issue stems from new characters having a preset starting reputation with all factions, and more importantly from the distribution of creatures in the world and their levels within their factions. For instance, all [spoiler]snapjaw[/spoiler] variants are low-level creatures that rapidly become a non-threat, whereas [spoiler]oozes[/spoiler] are present in nearly every terrain type and have members whose levels range from low to endgame. This means that reputation importance is homogenized across all but challenge or roleplay runs, but this ties into my next point.\n\nEach run having a unique, randomly generated history is a novel concept, but it ends up being disappointing as it's made clear that nearly all of the lore offers no strategic value. Don't get me wrong; the many lore entries and reputation snippets on legendary creatures are amusing to read, and flavor is certainly valuable, but ultimately they're as amusing as random generation allows. The more you get exposed to the dataset and the patterns, the more the flavor diminishes until it is completely tuned out. The term 'random generation' is meant literally here\u2014Sultan lore will at best reveal which creature types to expect in their respective historic sites or hint at the qualities of their relic, but there is no point in a holistic approach as there is no history to piece together. I can recall investing a lot of effort into engaging with the history system on my first decent run of the game. Reading each entry was exciting as I was under the impression that it mattered. This is in stark contrast to how I engage with this system hundreds of hours later, where I only gather historic entries because it's convenient to do so while autoexploring. The negative effect of random generation also extends to the legendary creatures\u2014randomly generating faction relationship descriptors means that factions won't be consistently characterized, which severely limits roleplaying. Controlling the randomness would've gone a long way in polishing these systems. For example, filtering the descriptors into themed pools and then randomly assigning one to each faction during world generation would've retained the variety achieved through randomness while giving factions an identity. The sky was the limit here, and I'm highly critical of these systems as they should've been a huge win in the game's favor, but as it stands, runs are indistinguishable by their \"complex social and historical simulation.\"\n\nOne last thing I'd like to address is the inconsistencies in certain balance changes. In the abovementioned video, Jason Grinblat also states that \"Qud is a game that's okay with the player breaking it over the knee\". While this statement rings true, the game seems quite selective about how it allows the player to break it. Methods of breaking the game's economy such as [spoiler]lava freezing[/spoiler] and most recently [spoiler]warm static pouring[/spoiler] have been nerfed to the point of redundancy, yet other, similarly effective methods which are even simpler to perform remain inexplicably unchanged. This unevenness is jarring and it is compounded by the invalidation of niche mechanics that perfectly fit in with the bizarre aesthetic as removing tools from the sandbox runs counter to the game's many ideals.\n\nThis was not meant to be a balanced review but a critical examination of a video game that is singular, evocative, and whose unique qualities have compelled me to put my thoughts into writing. Even though the majority have been negative, the one thing I would want anyone who reads this to take with them is that in spite of some misguided choices and missed opportunities Caves of Qud is wholly worth experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1735402678, "timestamp_updated": 1735694783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184000484": {"recommendationid": "184000484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141677532", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1735847573}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo MUITO DIF\u00cdCIL, miseric\u00f3rdia, das 12h que tenho, pelo menos 10h foi estressando por conta da dificuldade.

But hard. Gruk cry.\r\n-------\r\nTrue Kin Tale of Caves of Qud\r\n\r\nAs an aristocrat and one of the True Kin, I\u2019ve witnessed the rise and fall of many ventures - grand and small - but nothing quite compares to the awe-inspiring marvel that is Caves of Quid. This game doesn\u2019t merely deliver; it ensnares the senses, captivating both mind and body. From my elevated vantage, I can appreciate the rich intricacies woven into its mechanics, which offer a depth rarely seen in modern experiences. Each decision carries weight, and every move feels deliberate, as though the world itself bends to your will - an intoxicating feeling for one such as myself.\r\n\r\nWhat truly elevates this game, however, is the staggering diversity of factions present within the game. As an individual of notable status, I\u2019ve always admired the nuance and complexity of power dynamics, and here, the factions are not mere entities but living, breathing parts of the world. Their motivations, goals, and actions ripple through the game\u2019s layers in ways that make each encounter feel unique. You will never meet the same challenge twice, whether you\u2019re negotiating with cunning political players, battling ruthless warlords, or exploring the subterranean labyrinths of forgotten realms.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of exploration, the world is an immense tapestry, stretching endlessly in every direction. My True Kin ancestors often spoke of expansive territories, but even their stories pale in comparison to the sheer scale of Caves of Quid. The game\u2019s size is awe-inspiring, with hidden corners and secrets waiting to be uncovered. What sets it apart is the freedom it grants you in how to approach each challenge\u2014whether you choose diplomacy, brute force, or more subtle forms of manipulation, the paths are as diverse as the factions themselves.\r\n\r\nNo matter how you choose to navigate the world, Caves of Quid adapts, allowing each player to carve their own legacy within its walls. This is not merely a game, but an experience of staggering complexity\u2014one that promises to challenge even the most seasoned of strategists. For someone like me, accustomed to control and calculation, the experience is nothing short of exhilarating. In every way, Caves of Quid embodies a triumph of design, a world where every decision and every moment feels like a step toward an unknown but enticing future.\r\n\r\nIf there is one downside to Caves of Quid, it lies in its steep learning curve. The game's distinctive graphics style - minimalistic yet deeply intricate - can be overwhelming at first, particularly for those unaccustomed to its abstract approach. Coupled with the sheer amount of systems and mechanics to master, the early hours can feel like a barrage of new information. However, I would not call this a true flaw, but rather a challenge that enriches the experience. Like a complex political maneuver or the subtle art of negotiation, mastering the game's nuances becomes an achievement in itself. The difficulty of learning isn\u2019t a barrier but an invitation to truly immerse oneself, and for those willing to rise to it, Caves of Quid offers an unparalleled depth of satisfaction.", "timestamp_created": 1735398730, "timestamp_updated": 1735398730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183993563": {"recommendationid": "183993563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105676717", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 15415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15415, "last_played": 1735253193}, "language": "english", "review": "Weird and wonderful game,", "timestamp_created": 1735396812, "timestamp_updated": 1735396812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183993120": {"recommendationid": "183993120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076827191", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1683, "playtime_at_review": 1434, "deck_playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1737124304}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and immersive game.

But in this instance I will do the opposite and give a thumbs down and try to find the positives.\r\n\r\nMost positive reviews mention how \"deep\" this game and that is entirely true. They also mention the simplistic graphics and complicated interface which, somehow, add to the game ... which I explain as a kind of exagerated/added complexity that is not necessary, but becomes part of the charm of playing the game, learning at every step. I guess I'm nostalgic for that kind of experience, like when I played ruthless games on NES and SNES as a kid. \"Tutorial\" is a word I've heard for the first time decades after I started playing games, so I usually enjoy the painful process of learning to master a complex and ruthless game that requires you to start over and over again, until you \"git gud\" enough to  beat it.\r\n\r\nBut the Caves of Qud have beat me. Many of you will say that 5 hours is not enough for me to have learned enough about the game to \"get good 'nuf\" to learn to beat and I would agree with them, since for the first 2 hours I really enjoyed dying every 5 minutes. Then I enjoyed the next 3 hours when I actually took the time to read a guide, learn how to pay close attention to everything going on around my character, actually \"look\" at everything and I've learned ways to fight creatures I should have died to until I got to higher levels ... and then just hit another glass ceiling that I could have overcome ... but I kind of was tired and made the mistake of not noticing the differences in the enemy I was fighting.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where Caves of Qud breaks me. I played a lot of roguelike games that made me run through lots of hoops, dying and restarting a lot along the way until I either figured it out or got a lucky run, then died some more until I figured it out. Where Caves of Qud earns a negative reviews is that I was expecting different runs, in some ways, but the caves just make me go through the same hoops, on the same map, with the same quests ... every ... time.\r\n\r\nI do not believe this game earns it's procedural generation because I really do not feel in any way that any of my runs were really that much different. Yea, I might get killed by the score of different enemy types I have encountered and it's a crap shoot wether or not the generation decided to put an impossible challenge in front me right at the start, which forces me to maybe find a different way of levelling up (and hopefully that one I can tackle) but that's not even what really bothers me with the game.\r\n\r\nNope, what bothers me is: every. run. feels. the. exact. same. Even when I encounter different monsters in different ruins ! Maybe it's the graphics, maybe it's fact that I do not have the patience to read some entirely home brewed lore with made up words that have no real given meaning and are just brushed on the surface without being expanded.\r\n\r\nI really am not sure what my gripe with this game is besides saying that playing it feels like I'm trapped in groundhog's day, even though I have already tried every character (or are they classes ? I dunno) twice at least, trying to learn their differences ... without feeling much of a difference at all between different characters/classes. Even the choice of the starting world is a joke. It's a different village, always located in the same region of the map on a static map.\r\n\r\nI feel like I was fooled into thinking this game had some replayability. I don't feel like it has much of that. Maybe I'll come back to it some day and \"get the hype\", but right now I can't say that I do.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1735120037, "timestamp_updated": 1735120037, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701314985752105713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183633775": {"recommendationid": "183633775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246174460", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 986, "last_played": 1736028196}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a true RPG. \r\n\r\nLive and drink!", "timestamp_created": 1735116224, "timestamp_updated": 1735116224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183629115": {"recommendationid": "183629115", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980248821", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3057, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1737407429}, "language": "english", "review": "Really takes me back to playing old Angband variants.

Instead, what I really want to share is that this is the heir apparent, more than any game I've played in a couple decades, of Nethack. You will hear people liken this game to Dwarf Fortress, but that isn't terribly accurate beyond aesthetics. It is far closer to Nethack and the OG Rogue. Although there has been an endless sea of true rogue-likes since the days of Rogue and Nethack - many of them VERY good - Caves of Qud is the first game I've played that brought back the true Nethack feels.\n\nI don't need to explain what that means to those that spent many an hour trying to swipe the Amulet of Yendor, but for everyone else: Caves of Qud is, boiled down, a game that hates you in a way that will make you love it. I am very happy to see that there are non-permadeath modes, as this game has an atmosphere absolutely worth exploring to the fullest, but Classic is where it's at. This game will lull you into a false sense of security only to brutally - and literally - explode your head in the next 60 seconds.\n\nThere is a lot of noise about the random and bizarre aspects of this game, but not enough is said about the sheer tactical joy you will experience. Allow me to illustrate:\n\nI came across some ruins that I'd yet to explore. Ruins can potentially yield several highly valuable resources, so I opt to explore. I am an Esper, something I would liken to a Psyker from Warhammer 40k and the Highlander. I sense that another Esper from the dimension of Bubblebutt or whatever is nearby. Anyone who has played will tell you that two Espers meeting is an extremely tense moment, and that, much like Highlander, There Can Be Only One. I carefully pick my way into the ruins and suddenly find myself encased in a forcefield and can't move. Too bad I don't have a Reality Grenade to counter the psychic phenomenon. Immediately after that, the enemy tries to burrow into my mind in order to literally cause my head to explode. Fortunately, my Mental Mirror reflects the attack. What it doesn't reflect is the Cryokinesis the Psychic Interdimensional Horse - yes, like Mr. Ed - Assassin drops on me, freezing me solid inside the forcefield. I excite the molecules of air around the horse, creating a wildfire. Now we are both inconvenienced. I thaw out, but have taken some damage. The forcefield breaks, I begin gathering the innate light I generate to burn holes into the Horse with pinpoint accurate lasers. I fire off a couple such psychic lasers, but the Horse begins to try and invade my mind again. Unfortunately, my Mental Mirror hasn't regenerated, and I am taking significant damage each round. Worse, if I don't break the link, I will suffer head-explodingly catestrophic damage after a few rounds. Thinkthinkthink! AH! I use my teleport to move myself inside of the ruins! This causes the Horse to lose track of me and it isn't able to tunnel into my mind any longer. Oh, but the Horse has a trick up its sleeve! A vortex of swirling unreality summoned almost on top of me that can literally suck me in and teleport me to Rasheph knows where. No problem! I will just activate Sprint and dash - Oops. Problem! I teleported into a huge pool of salt water and am waist-deep in brine, I can't sprint! I struggle to stay clear of the Vortex and the worst thing happens - or does it? Althought the Horse has no line of sight to me, it obviously senses my general location and generates another patch of enervating cold... This time, however, it fails to encase me in ice. Ah, but it DOES freeze the water underneath me, giving me solid ground to stand on! I use my Jump ability to clear the last block of water and barely manage to evade the all-consuming vortex! I've had enough of this equine at this point, and bring my dual chain-pistols to bear... I come around a wall and begin sprinting directly toward the damn old nag, spraying bullets from my pistols literally all over the place. The Horse tries to zap me with lasers of its own, but my own high skill in the same psychic talent causes the beam to bounce harmlessly away. Just to be on the safe side, I erect a forcefield of my own, and pump a wild stream of bullets in the Horse's general direction until it is dead. Upon it's death, I have the choice to absorb it's psyche and permanently increate my power. In doing so, I become even more of an attractive beacon to the ever-hungry mind-devourers from the infinite dimensions.\n\nI hit \"y\" on my keyboard.\n\nLet them come.\n\n[i]Seek the Kasaphesence if you...[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] \ud83d\udca7 Liked Rogue/Nethack.

The graphics are surprisingly immersive despite being tile-based (seeing the enemy's ashes scatter to the wind as you vaporize them with lasers never gets old). The lore is rich, if a bit samey. There are some extremely intriguing characters to meet and the game is very inclusive. It is always a joy to roll a new character. Though there is a lot of repetition in runs, there will be moments of novelty almost every time that catch you off guard. The main \"loop\" I would say, consists of doing a lot of dungeon delving and trading to stock yourself up H E A V I L Y for the next leg of the main story. Locking yourself into one mode of problem-solving is death. Having tons of redundant plans is life. To that end, there is a lot of \"boring\" grinding (personally, I would call it relaxing) to level up and stock up on gear that will see you through the next brutally punishing main dungeon.

If you're playing with a mouse and keyboard, be prepared for the game to glitch\u2014at least at the time of this review, on version 1.0.\n\nStrangely enough, the process works perfectly on the Steam Deck.\n\nNegative points for me:\n\nI'm not a big fan of this type of setting, where the future feels more like fantasy. I would prefer a more serious tone, but I\u2019ve managed to tolerate it.\n\nI believe the graphics are part of the game's charm, but the UI is confusing. I think this is a recurring issue with roguelikes: they often have a lot of depth, but the user interface is always a tiresome learning curve.\n\nI'm still figuring out some keys and buttons to get by. So far, it's working, but I haven\u2019t yet experienced the freedom that many people mention. However, I have less than 3 hours of playtime, so that might change.\n\nThe music is terrible. Unfortunately, I found it repetitive and poorly composed, ruining the game\u2019s atmosphere and overall feeling. I turned it off, and it was much better. Some areas lack ambient sounds, but when they\u2019re present, the game succeeds in conveying a mysterious vibe and the atmosphere of an intriguing book.\n\nNow for the positive aspects that made me repurchase the game, even after struggling with the PC interface and tutorial bugs:\n\nThe game works on the Steam Deck.\n\nIt\u2019s almost surprising that a game with such a confusing UI can work with so few buttons, but it does. It takes some time to get used to, but it\u2019s very interesting, and the game manages to hook you in.\n\nIt\u2019s engaging precisely because it\u2019s so vast. Each area is a surprise, and the difficulty isn\u2019t as absurd as RPGs from the '80s or '90s. It gives you room to grow, level up, and even abuse powerful skills to deal with enemies.\n\nNot to mention the roleplay aspect\u2014the game has checkpoints, which breaks the roguelike mold and lets you retry. For instance, I kept dying to a red bear, but by using a skill like \"STAREDOWN,\" you can intimidate enemies into fleeing, giving you time to recover and land a few more hits.\n\nWhile I\u2019d prefer a less fantastical setting, the game works well regardless. Its unique graphical style and the curiosity it sparks make you want to keep playing.\n\nI\u2019m still new to roguelikes of this type. I\u2019ve wanted to play CDDA, for example, but every version I\u2019ve tried is buggy or has a painful UI. I believe Caves of Qud is a unique experience that\u2019s worth it.\n\nThe price felt a bit steep, but most roguelikes of this type are similarly priced.\n\nI recommend the game. I don\u2019t consider it perfect, but it\u2019s different enough to spark curiosity and is great to play while lying down.\n\nAnd remember: it runs great on the Steam Deck!\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1735069124, "timestamp_updated": 1735069124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624079406261444092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "183592483": {"recommendationid": "183592483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025471967", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "deck_playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1735866616}, "language": "english", "review": "Became a hyper aggressive turtle that could photosynthesize nutrients from the sun. \r\n\r\nStole a bunch of stuff from an underground lab I found with weird mutated troglodytes roaming around. \r\n\r\nSeasoned my food with the blood of my enemies.\r\n\r\nGot mauled by a pack of giant mutated baboons, and died.", "timestamp_created": 1735069027, "timestamp_updated": 1735069027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, "183589856": {"recommendationid": "183589856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204939795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "deck_playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1735595196}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm weak and playing on role playing difficulty cause I hate perma-death.

It's incredibly interesting, hugely random (yet strangely repetitive, as random generation often ends up being) and, for all its far future mutant and science fiction oddness, rather more traditional than it pretends to be. As in, it's powered by dice rolls and many classic dnd/roguelike mechanics and has graphics that hark back to 30 years ago. \r\n\r\nThe writing is beyond purple into the ultraviolet. As a stylistic choice, I initially liked it, but it quickly became so much background-cruft. Yes, yes, I'm sure it's exciting that that this item \"gleams with nanothings sundered from the spacetime braid\" or somesuch, but should I equip it? Oh, no clue? In a game where a non zero amount of things will kill you more or less instantly without warning? Off to the wiki I go for the information that wasn't accessible to me in the game, then. Even though I have an implant that specifically exists to identify artifacts for me....\r\n\r\nThe multiple ending story is far too long for traditional roguelike play, in my inexpert opinion, as you'll probably maintain a run for double-digit hours to get near the end. It's a shame that you can't reload earlier saves to experience the multiple endings, since there's no way I'm making another character to do so. I thought the collision of inclusive sensibilities and old testament references in a weird post future world was cool, not that the story does especially much with any of those things.\r\n\r\nOne thing worth mentioning is that this game wants you to break it, or even cheese it. There are dozens of ways of breaking the economy, and five or six different ways of basically becoming borderline immortal (not that the game won't randomly spawn enemies that will straight up kill even extremely strong characters without any warning -you have to look at everything you haven't seen before and consider \"should I hit the bricks rather than find out why that thing has an \"impossible\" rating?\" If you're not ending the game with a small army of clones of yourself or wielding enough weapons that you resemble a battleship, you're doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nNow that I've completed the story, I feel like I've seen 90% of what it has to offer.

Non posso neanche descrivere tutte le cazzate che \u00e8 possibile fare in questo gioco.
