It looks like the developers spent more money making the intro animation/advert for this Ragnarok Online inspired WoW ripoff than they did actually making the game.  And that wasted money is something they seem desperate to recover... wait until you see how much they want for all the P2W DLC.\n\nThere's only a handful of classes and even less to do with them in the game.. it quickly turns into a grindfest so appalling that it would make mobile devs foam at the mouth with excitement.\n\nThis has some really mediocre looking graphics that will understandably be a turn off for a lot of gamers, and it's a big contributor to the failure of the game to attract gamers despite having no up-front cost.  Gaming is a primarily visual medium, and if developers want to succeed, they must understand that it's not an area for compromise.  You deserve better than compromises.\n\nOn pricing and value for gamers, this isn't really free as the developers are trying to scam PC gamers out of TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN UNITED STATES DOLLARS worth of P2W DLC packs... really disgusting monetization.\n\nBearing in mind that free games don't add +1 to your game collector count, should you bother adding this to your library and downloading it?\n\nNope.  This isn't worth downloading.

Movement feels pretty clunky. Tab target combat with lots of downtime for recovery early on, and not many in-game options. It also performs poorly for such an old title. It's also kinda beautiful in that early-mid 2000s anime MMORPG way that's hard to describe. The enemy designs are pretty adorable, if a bit goofy.
