I love the twists on classic fairy tales and the incorporation of traditional fairy tale lessons. Overall, the stories are fun, sweet, exciting, and romantic. Although the tone is a bit young for me (as is typical of many VNs), I didn't find it overly immature or cringy.\n\nGameplay: The biggest issue I have with the game aspect is the limited number of choices\u2014only about three per chapter, and these are very long chapters. For the most part, the consequences of these choices feel random, with little indication of how they might affect others' reactions. In a game like this, I would prefer options to be more intuitive, either based on what you know about the story or what you can extrapolate from the characters. Unfortunately, only a small handful of choices seem to follow this approach.\n\nSuggested Route Order: To build on the narrative and avoid spoilers about characters before completing their routes, I recommend playing in the following order:\n\nRod\nKarma\nRumpel\nFritz\nWaltz\n\nMinor Spoilers Ahead\n\nRoute Impressions (Good Endings):\n\nRod:\nRod's story focuses heavily on Lucette's family and includes more Cinderella elements than the other routes. However, both Rod's personality and his connection with Lucette feel flat, with little reason for their romance to develop. His story serves as a baseline, making it a good starting point if you're planning to play all the routes.\n\nKarma:\nKarma's story is arguably the best in terms of romance. His and Lucette's personalities complement each other well, and they both grow significantly throughout the route. He also has one of the more intriguing curses.\n\nRumpel:\nRumpel's story is comparable to Karma's in terms of romance and character development. While I personally prefer Karma's dynamic with Lucette, Rumpel's route is still engaging and heartfelt (and in some ways a little more silly/humorous).\n\nFritz:\nFritz's story is the darkest but also the least compelling in terms of his personality. While Rod feels like the weakest romantic fit for Lucette, Fritz has minimal screen time and a one-dimensional \"white knight\" character. Varg is far more compelling in this route, but he isn't an option. Although Fritz's story is harsher and more tragic than the others, it provides crucial background information on the main conflict.\n\nWaltz:\nWaltz's route involves more reconciliation with Lucette's father than the others. Since I played his story last, it felt less exciting, likely because I had already uncovered much of the overarching narrative.  Despite this, Waltz's route ties together many elements from the other stories, making it feel like a \"true\" ending or golden route.\n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nKarma and Rumpel's routes are more character-driven and sweet, focusing on building relationships and personal growth. In contrast, Fritz and Rod's routes are more story-driven. Waltz's route strikes a balance between the two.\n\nWaltz and Fritz's routes are the only ones where you encounter Lucette's mother, and they also have more tragedies, particularly Fritz's (though still HEA). Additionally, Rod and Fritz's routes are set primarily within the palace, while Karma and Rumpel's take place at the Marchen. Waltz's story combines elements of both settings.\n\nWaltz's ending ties up many of the storylines and highlights the theme of personal growth and being a good person. While this makes it feel like the most satisfying conclusion, I still believe Karma's route offers the sweetest romance, closely followed by Rumpel's.", "timestamp_created": 1736994617, "timestamp_updated": 1736994617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185449687": {"recommendationid": "185449687", "author": {"steamid": "76561199562417517", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "playtime_at_review": 1578, "last_played": 1736662642}, "language": "english", "review": "Cinderella Phenomenon has been a favorite visual novel of mine for a long time. I remember watching a youtuber do a playthrough when I was younger and was so excited to play the game myself. I definitely recommend playing the game but some things to be aware of: if you ever switch devices the game resets itself on steam even if your achievements stay, there is a relationship with Rumpel that is a large age gap, and Rod is your step-brother.\n\nTo give more context, I had gotten a new laptop in the midst of completing this game and upon opening the game on my new laptop I was distraught to discover all my saves vanished and none of the routes I completed were visible. The opening page having the picture of the guys you completed the route for and all of them had been gems, nothing having saved from the game previously. So if you want to complete this game be aware not to switch devices in the midst of it.\n\nRegarding routes, my favorite is definitely Waltz but within the common routes my favorite is Karma. I think these two routes are so well written and I definitely enjoyed them the most so when I had to regain the progress I lost I decided to fully replay those routes. My third favorite was Fritz as the only thing that upsets me about his route is how you get a happy ending but I can't give more context without spoilers. Finally, out of the last two it goes Rumpel then Rod because of the age gap and step-brother part of their relationships it stopped me from fully enjoying their routes myself specifically Rod's route. I know it doesn't bother everyone but I would like to point it out in case it does bother you as it did bother me somewhat.

I really liked all of them just some more than others) So, the ranking for each character is as follows \u2013 \nWaltz \nKarma (Klaude) \nRod\nRumpel (Chevalier)\nFritz\n\nTo start this list is very different from when I first played it. Then again when I first played it was like four years ago and I had only finished Karma and Rod\u2019s route. I finally finished all routes and that\u2019s where my opinion changes. Karma\u2019s route was the first one I did, and I loved his character and the storyline as Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies. I was going to give Karma first place; However Waltz gets first places because I liked his storyline just a tad more. Rod is kind of the middleman as I did like the storyline better than Rumple\u2019s and Fritz. I could never really enjoy Rumple\u2019s route. It was sweet but just not my favorite. Now Fritz\u2019s? I wanted so much to like his route because when I played the prologue, he was the first character\u2019s route I wanted to complete. Then I realized his route was locked. I\u2019ve heard someone else mention this and I agree. I felt like there wasn\u2019t as much build up to the romance as the other characters. Plus, I felt his route contained the most deaths and I really disliked Hildyr and didn\u2019t enjoy reading about the time her and Lucette spent in the palace. Though I know it was necessary for Fritz\u2019s route. Apart from that I really did enjoy all the love interest\u2019s routes and for a free Otome game it really is amazing. The story kept me engage and I looked forward to every chance I got to continue the game. I hated going back through the game to get the bad endings, but I wanted to get all the achievements and it was interesting to see the bad outcomes of each man\u2019s route. I look forward to continuing the adventure in the sequel and seeing how the mc's relationship grows with the men. \n", "timestamp_created": 1736148502, "timestamp_updated": 1736148502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184905247": {"recommendationid": "184905247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799697254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1736146355}, "language": "english", "review": "Why are 2/5 love interests children?
