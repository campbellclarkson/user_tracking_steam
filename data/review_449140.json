That's perfectly fine, I get it. Life moves on, but I do hope that one day they will come back and/or drop some new game with similar gameplay to istrolid because no other RTS i've ever played has had the level of creativity that Istrolid brings to the table.\n\nShips built in istrolid are more or less balanced around a \"Rock paper scissors lizard spock Doc-ock\" kind of format, where Ship type X beats Ship type S and Z but loses to Y, R, and H.\n\nMakes for an interesting dynamic, especially since with player skill the weaknesses of certain fleets of ships can be overcome, such as ships that run out of energy quickly, they could be followed by a ship that *JUST* keeps those ships powered up, but if the ships that work as batteries get blown up by an enemy Kamakaze nuke then those running bombers can quickly become useless, so it's reasonable to make smaller ships to purposely get the kamikaze to blow up prematurely, then the other player can use the Nuke as a \"threat\" to keep the other player on-guard and keep their eyes and attention away from other points of interest.\n\nETC, ETC. \n\nThere is so much depth in this game, locked behind a dwindling playerbase and increasingly smaller dev teams(if any are left). \n\nEven with all that, Istrolid's single player is still worth playing through as a 9/10 experience.", "timestamp_created": 1735796998, "timestamp_updated": 1735796998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184261180": {"recommendationid": "184261180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426921350", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1735596539}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want a more enjoyable PVP experience play cosmoteer PVP", "timestamp_created": 1735596666, "timestamp_updated": 1735596666, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511123538017272949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183893836": {"recommendationid": "183893836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161879557", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6725, "last_played": 1734092163}, "language": "english", "review": "This game rocks, keep up the work or bring me another", "timestamp_created": 1735318151, "timestamp_updated": 1735318151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 2313, "total_negative": 333, "total_reviews": 2646}, "cursors": {"AoJw2tae3P8CfKP8rQM=": "Mon Jan 20 19:08:12 2025"}}
