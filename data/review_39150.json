Subjectively speaking, it\u2019s a mess. Let me start with its gameplay aspects. The whole game revolves around the Guardian Forces (GF) and the Junction System which a lot of people find very difficult to deal with. Since the whole game revolves around them, leveling up doesn\u2019t make you stronger. Instead, it punishes you by scaling enemies to your level. In order to overcome your enemies, you\u2019ll need some strong magic to junction to your stats and your GFs should learn the necessary junction abilities for that to happen. To teach them the new abilities, you\u2019ll need to engage in battles and gain AP, only then you will be able to raise your strength, HP, or other stats. I could spend hours explaining the whole junction system to you, but we all know that it\u2019d be a waste of time. Now another important part: Magic. None of your characters have MP that depletes upon magic usage, instead you \u201cdraw\u201d magic from enemies and stock them. You can draw all kinds of magic as many as you\u2019d like, you can even cast them on your enemies without having to stock them. Some bosses also hold new GFs for you to draw, so be sure to keep an eye out for them if you ever decide to go through this madness. As I\u2019ve said before, GFs are very important but not only because they are used to junction magic to your stats, they are also used as summons to destroy your enemies and some of them have ridiculously long animations that you\u2019ll need to sit through over and over again until you can get a strong magic to junction to your STR. And no, there\u2019s no limit as to how many times you can use them in battle. Alternatively, you can use Limit Breaks that trigger upon low HP. \n\nThat about sums up the whole gameplay gimmick of FFVIII, but the real problem is the fact that it\u2019s a completionist\u2019s nightmare. I mean, I\u2019ve gone through Final Fantasy VII, and I never had any problems with it when it came to the stuff I needed to do to attain a 100% completion rate. In that regard, FFVIII is horrible. There\u2019s just way too much stuff to collect, many GFs to draw, and the amount of grinding needed for one specific achievement is just insane. Now I know I sound clich\u00e9 when I compare it to VII, but come on, VIII looks better, its cutscenes are definitely much better, but it lacks everything that VII had and successfully pulled off. It didn\u2019t have Triple Triad, VIII gets a huge point there, but it still isn\u2019t enough to justify its questionable story and gameplay gimmicks. There\u2019s also a separate mini-game called Chocobo World that you can play to find items that you can use. It was originally released only in Japan because it was played on Pocket Station and as you all know, it was a Japan-exclusive accessory for the PSX. And yes, you\u2019ll need to do some grinding in Chocobo World if you want 100%. Funny enough, I had more fun playing Chocobo World than VIII itself mostly because I didn\u2019t have to worry about many things in there. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the story. I don\u2019t even know where to start there. It\u2019s full of inconsistencies, ridiculous plot twists (yes, I\u2019m talking about that orphanage twist), and a dull main character: Squall. Squall is an extremely introverted and edgy guy who is a student in Balamb Garden which Cid and Edea formed. He usually fights Seifer, who happens to be the opposite of Squall. They introduce him as a grey character which makes him quite interesting, but later, they turn him into a simple villain without any depth and his only purpose becomes serving the Sorceress. The Sorceress also changes a few times throughout the story and at some point, you feel like they simply improvised the whole thing as they developed the game and they ended up with this mess of a story that heavily relies on fan theories to be justified. There\u2019s also Laguna who I believe is the real protagonist of the game. He\u2019s a cheerful guy unlike Squall and he\u2019s way more relatable. The romance between Squall and Rinoa is\u2026 irritating mostly due to the fact that Squall\u2019s questionable behavior, but it\u2019s alright I guess.\n \nHowever, unlike VII, none of the characters\u2019 backstories are being explored and that is probably because of the ridiculous orphanage twist. I don\u2019t even want to talk about it, it\u2019s just bad. Very, very bad. Another point that bothered me about the story was how none of the important events such as NORG and Squall\u2019s injury were mentioned ever again. Why? Why would you include them in the story if you\u2019re not going to develop something upon them? Finally, the ending\u2026 Oh man, the ending\u2026 I actually love it. The whole time compression incident, Squall being stuck in there for a bit, then returning to Rinoa and his friends like nothing happened. Yeah, it\u2019s quite interesting actually but only if it\u2019s supported by crazy fan theories such as \u201cSquall is Dead\u201d. Hey, maybe I didn\u2019t get it. Perhaps the ending was left to the player\u2019s interpretation which is a good thing, but I can\u2019t really turn a blind eye to all those inconsistencies in the story. I\u2019d like to think of Final Fantasy VIII as a failed experiment and it\u2019s a shame. It could\u2019ve been a masterpiece, the potential was there, but it\u2019s ruined by questionable writing and tedious gameplay mechanics.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nAn experimental entry to the Final Fantasy series that does almost everything wrong and tedious. The gameplay gimmicks such as GFs and Junction System could be complicated for newcomers, but they are not bad once you learn how they work. However, the story is very inconsistent, therefore; it heavily relies on fan theories to be justified. The only redeeming quality of it could be the soundtrack and the card game Triple Triad. Keep in mind that many people are blinded by nostalgia and they prefer to turn a blind eye to its critical faults, thus they praise it a lot, but in reality, it\u2019s one of the weakest entries to the franchise.
