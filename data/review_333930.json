Is this game any different from other FPS\u2019? Absolutely not. There are several aspects of the game that are actually worse. Let me start from the fact that the game has been abandoned for 6 years now. When you launch the game and load to main menu, it may seem like the game is still alive as you are bombarded with updates and other news related to the game. The moment you actually click on one of those news or updates, you are gonna see the year of 2019 everywhere. \n\nThe game being abandoned can also be visible by the number of active players (less than 100 players login on a daily basis) and the quality of such players. There are only a handful of people left that still play the game and almost all of them are jerks. The chat is full of disrespectful comments, insults, bullying and trash talk. People are more focused on fighting on the chat than fighting in-game. I didn\u2019t like seeing this so I started muting other players. After a few matches I already had a majority of the server muted but only in theory. You see, the mute works but only for the match it was applied in. When you start another match you are going to see that the players you previously muted show as muted but you can still see what they are writing. If you wanna keep these people muted, you have to go out of your way at the beginning of every match to unmute and mute them again. What is even worse is the fact that mute doesn\u2019t apply to in-game quick chat commands. Despite muting someone, you will still see all the quick chat messages that, of course, are sent in an insulting manner like spamming \u201cNice shot!\u201d after someone misses an ability and dies. The game doesn\u2019t give you an option to turn off the chat so you are forced to endure that constant toxicity for your whole experience with the game. Another thing I would like to mention are cheaters. So far, I have only come across two that weren\u2019t trying to hide it and were very obvious about it. I was shocked to see that one of them had 2600 hours, the other had 1200h. All I can say is that they must have been doing it for a long time and since the game is abandoned, they can continue to do that without any consequences. In short, the community of this game gives a really bad impression. \n\nThe servers in this game are terrible. You won\u2019t keep your ping stable. Get ready to have random spikes up to the point where you will be auto-kicked by the server, because that can happen when your ping exceeds 150. Usually, the majority of the server experiences those spikes at once. If you are kicked, you won\u2019t be able to rejoin until the match is over. Imagine being kicked due to a random ping spike and be unable to join the only server with players. Apart from that, the tickrate or whatever is responsible for making the whole experience smoother, must be set at the minimum level. The whole experience from moving to shooting is just awful. Only a small % of shots actually registers. Also, when you are using a sniper rifle and shoot your opponent directly into their head, most of the time the server will register it as just a body shot which won\u2019t even kill them. It is really bad.\n\nThe game also has a lot of annoying and overpowered mechanics. The one I find most absurd is the one where people instead of being killed, are first downed. That in itself is not that bad but the fact that they can be instantly revived with a shield granting them immunity to damage for at least a second is dumb. They can be revived like that indefinitely even from the other side of the map. I had countless situations where I have downed my opponent like 5 times in a row and I ended up dying to him while he stayed alive thanks to having a good medic in his team. This happens often even in random shootouts. You are fighting with someone, down them and they are instantly revived with immunity to damage. You usually won\u2019t even have enough bullets to down them again and need to reload. Whatever happens, you are unlikely to emerge from that situation victorious. There are a few characters that have one shot area of damage abilities and only those are played by the players. You will often find yourself instantly killed by something you did not even see coming. There is a huge imbalance because 80% of the weapons and abilities are just useless. Nobody plays those but if you decide to do it yourself, you will be putting yourself at an enormous disadvantage. Another awful mechanic is related to in-game objectives that often involve planting a bomb or repairing something. Some classes do it faster than others and can take over, cutting others from the source of experience. It gets hella annoying when you start repairing an objective gaining a lot of exp and out of nowhere some random will appear and basically kick you out of the objective window because \u201che can repair faster\u201d stealing all experience and credit for the objective even if there is only a second left on it. This feels like some unfunny joke. \n\nAnother bad aspect of this game are maps. These are very linear and very unbalanced. Not much effort went into those and it is clearly visible while playing the game. The matches are most of the time very one sided. The losing team is just being spawn camped most of the time. There are not many paths on the maps. Usually one of those paths is camped by like 4 people at once from the winning team making every shootout a 1 vs 4. There is an option to call a vote to shuffle teams but I have spent 70 hours in this game and have not yet seen it happening. People never vote for it, the winning team will vote against it.\n\nThe achievements in this game aren\u2019t very good either. There is a good amount of easy achievements, quite a lot of those that require a ton of grinding and one that\u2019s literally \u201cimpossible\u201d to obtain. The impossible achievement is the one I want to focus on. There is a hidden achievement that requires you to revive 5 teammates at once. While normally playing the game you will not get it. Situation like this may happen once in a million and you would have to have the right class at the right time and be in the right place. This is not happening. Your best shot is to gather enough people for the sole purpose of obtaining this achievement and do it on an empty server. I have been trying to do that but in 2025 I don't think that it's possible. There is just not enough people that would want to do that now. I already accepted the fact that I may not be able to finish this game achievement-wise.\n\nIn summary, the game is really, really bad. You are better off playing something else. There are a ton of online shooters that are not dead, nor abandoned by its creators. This game simply doesn\u2019t have anything good to offer. All it has to offer is a small and very toxic community, awful servers, terrible mechanics and dreadful maps. It also has an impossible achievement making the game unable to complete for collectors. I personally haven\u2019t enjoyed the game for even a second. It was a negative experience from the very start to the end.
