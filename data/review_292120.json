Compared to all prior Final Fantasy games, the battle mechanics along with pretty much every aspect of the game are just abysmal. The worst one out of the 13. The only positive I can think of is the effort that went into the cut-scenes. I don't understand why Square-Enix designed FF13 the way they did but it made me feel obsolete. As others have already mentioned, the story is linear, the battles are semi automated and you can't fully control your character. You only have control of 1 member of your party until way further into the game and you go into the game not knowing enough of what's going on to really appreciate the RPG aspect of it. Not worth your time if you're expecting the same caliber as the more modern Final Fantasies like 7, 9, 10/11 or even 12 (which I liked, minus the grind).", "timestamp_created": 1737341458, "timestamp_updated": 1737341458, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185986280": {"recommendationid": "185986280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275736104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1737344789}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story and good graphics for its time, unique combat and incredible music with many nostalgic moments for me personally. give it a try!", "timestamp_created": 1737337359, "timestamp_updated": 1737337359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185959192": {"recommendationid": "185959192", "author": {"steamid": "76561199256063921", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1815, "last_played": 1730310080}, "language": "english", "review": "Just make sure to kill off Hope every battle.

There's no option to change the audio language.\n\n2.The gameplay is very linear. The path feels like a long tunnel or corridor. The only place where you can start free-roaming is in Grand Pulse (Chapter 11).\n\n3.The mini-map is rotated, with no compass directions (North/East/South/West).

At best, I would definitely rate this game like a 6.5 out of 10, it's not a terrible game as people make it out to be. But it sure does have its faults.\r\n\r\nTo start:\r\n  - The beginning of this game is really boring, up until Chapter 3 where the \"real\" mechanics begin. Yes, the combat (paradigm/crystarium system) finally works 3 Chapters in. I can see why people who don't know absolutely nothing about the game will quit it before Chapter 3 begins because it is SO BORING.\r\n  - The beginning of the game also makes you think you should know everything that's going on and it kinda forces you to make you read about the events unfolding. Yes, this is a common negative a lot of people talk about, the \"datalog\" and the lore. However it isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Yes, it's way too much information going on, and the narrative should've explained things much better instead of just blurting out names from the characters.\r\n  - You won't get a full 3 person party until Chapter 10. This honestly kinda pisses me off, the game is close to ending and you're barely giving me the permission to have a 3 person party. Yes, events happen where the previous chapters are only 2 party members. Still, it is really annoying just missing a person for almost the entire game.\r\n  - \"The game opens up at Chapter 11.\" So you're telling me, the game actually becomes a game, 2 chapters before it ends. ??? Not only that but man does the difficulty spike hit super hard once you get to this chapter. You are forced to grind which depends on the type of player you are can either be really annoying or just part of the rpg genre. Had to grind about 2 hours because a basic enemy was 2 shotting my entire team lol. Call that a skill issue on my part. Still, this game makes Chapters 1-10 a glorified tutorial which is baffling to me, I just don't know how to feel about that.\r\n  - The main villain sucks and his name is literally Bart. Plus the final boss has an random chance instant kill spell, which is super dumb.\r\n  - Nitpick; when entering combat and switching paradigm, you're forced to watch a 3 second cutscene of your whole party switching classes. This is just me but this pissed me off because you can get a game-over during this small cutscene. \r\n  -  Your party AI can sometimes be utterly brain dead to the point where YOU have to put matters in your own hands. Especially healer AI, they don't Esuna or Raise UNTIL all the party members are full health. This is stupid and I hated it.\r\n  - You cannot control your character's movements during combat, meaning ALL of your party members WILL stack together to get hit by an AOE attack. WHY????????????????????\r\n  - Upgrading system sucks.\r\n  - Save station menu navigating SUCKS. \r\n  - Whoever designed the camera needs to get punched in the face.\r\n  - If the party leader dies it's game over, go fuck yourself.\r\n  - My biggest disappointment, and others can definitely say that I'm wrong about this, is that the summon system is terrible? Summons, KNOWN for dishing out TONS of damage hit like a wet napkin. They're only ever used for getting your party out of dangerous situations only for a short while.\r\n  - PC support is horrendous and the game looks horrible if you don't get a modfix. Base FF13 has a weird diagonal cut?? It's really bizarre, also the game is capped at 30fps along with ugly as hell graphics. The mod made this game look amazing though, so good on them for fixing it.\r\n  - The story is just mid. There's some good moments and then there's RIDICULOUS moments. JRPGs are known for being really tropey, but this game does it to an extreme. There are several parts in the story that legit makes no sense and the characters just play it off as nothing happens.\r\n  - Speaking of characters, I feel very mixed. I like them, but mostly their entire personality consists of just talking about one person, THE ENTIRE GAME. SHUT. UP. SNOW WE GET IT. The first half the characters are unlikeable, which I kinda like, they're all douchebags to one another and eventually will come together as a true party. Especially Hope, who can be super annoying at the beginning of the game. Vanille's stupid \"noises\" during combat and exploring is really annoying too. Lightning can also come off as having the personality of stale bread and I'm pretty sure anyone who played this game has called her \"Girl Cloud\" at least once. Fang is too cool to change. Either way, this game is way more character-driven than story-driven.\r\n  - The music is pretty good!\r\n\r\nI've said a lot of bad things about this game but when it's good, it is actually engaging. The paradigm system can be a lot of fun once you start learning how to get around encounters, switching back and forth to see what meets and what not. A gripe I had is that some characters are miles better than others, Hope has a faster animation of casting compared to ANYONE else which kinda makes him a must have near the end of the game. However, any character can be viable, which is cool. \r\n\r\nI've said enough; TLDR: This game has lots of faults, and can be summed down to be just a mid game, but it does have its highs.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1737173065, "timestamp_updated": 1737173065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185816526": {"recommendationid": "185816526", "author": {"steamid": "76561199712502043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 948, "playtime_at_review": 1077, "last_played": 1737228348}, "language": "english", "review": "It's rly good if you enjoy linear games.", "timestamp_created": 1737155477, "timestamp_updated": 1737155477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185808035": {"recommendationid": "185808035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084552343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1639, "playtime_at_review": 1664, "last_played": 1737145080}, "language": "english", "review": "I've tried very hard to get into this title but after 27 hours I can't safely say this game isn't for me. \n\nThe premise is very interesting and the characters do feel fleshed out enough to see where the writers wanted to go with them but I feel like the pacing despite being linear till chapter 11 is all over the place and I feel like the writers were butting heads with each other over interpretations of certain character arcs and the plot itself seems to be padded out for a much longer length then it really needed to be.   \n\nCombat is really a mixed bag as in the beginning it feels like they're afraid of you getting confused so they limit the amount of actions you can do till your a Lia'ce (magic user) and it doesn't really open up in terms of customization till about 10 hours in and hell you have no actual control of your party set up till....20 hours into the game.

Some love it, some hate it, but I was and until now, one of the fans who love this game even though I never had a chance to own a PS3. The only time I got to finally play this is when SE decided to release this on PC back in 2014. And funny thing is, the early version I had was unofficial version (if you know what I mean). And this game has been in my Steam wishlist for 10 years. And lately, thanks to Steam winter sale I finally decided to purchase it. \n\nBut my good, the only mistake that I made is that this version, particularly if you're in Asian territory there's no English dub, only Japanese voiceover but everything else in the game is English. Now, why do I really love this game:\n1. This game was released at the peak of popularity of the 7th Generation of consoles, particularly the PS3.\n2. It was technically ahead of it's time in terms of visuals, truly the epitome of HD, and quite frankly the graphics still holds up to this day.\n3. The year 2009 was so nostalgic to me, I don't want to get into details but to put it simply 2009 was the year when AAA blockbusters games were at the peak.\n4. The game is so gorgeous, the characters and the environment are detailed I was blown away the first time I saw the gameplay back in the day. \n5. Although I'm not sure, but some say the Steam version was ripped straight out of the Xbox 360 version, little optimization was made and for me it was quite disappointing because there's no settings for graphics. But nonetheless it's still look stunning, you can also crank up the resolution based on your monitor and I'd say that the quality is fantastic. I've been playing this game on my LENOVO LEGION GO and in my opinion it's the best way to play it considering it was tailored for controllers.\n6. The combat is strong with this one, the paradigm shift really made this game immersive since you can change the role of every member of your team in real time.\n7. STAGGER - prolly the best game mechanic SE introduced, and up until now newer games like FF7 remake also had it as well.\n\nWith all that in mind, I know there's the elephant in room that needs to be address - the plot of the game itself. And I agree, it's not the best. There are certain events in the game that will make you bored to death, it's linear and not really an open world like its predecessors. Due to lack of areas to explore it leads to overall fatigue especially when you play this in one sitting, and I wouldn't recommend that. You'll have to stop once in a while, because when I played this in 2014 it took me weeks to beat this game. And I forced myself to finish the game because I wanna see the ending in HD. \n\nNot gonna lie, the cutscenes in this game is topnotch. And I guess that's where the charm of this game, it's kind of double edged sword. You will hate it because the story sucks but the other aspects of the game like visuals and game mechanics still will make you play this game just for eye candy.

It's cool and all to have weird creatures and technology, confusing weapons that look cool (what is Vanille's weapon supposed to be?), but when you start doing things like having to manually unequip an item from a separate option in the menu if you want to equip it on another character, or having to go into three separate options to enter the Buy menu in the store, or that you have to select a potion, then select 'All allies\" then do something I can't even express in words to apply the potion which is unclear if it was applied, heck, then I start noticing how silly it looks that you even made chests round in an effort to be different.\r\n\r\nCombat so far is also quite uninteresting, with the option to do a normal attack or an attack that hits multiple enemies, or auto-battle, which selects one of either of those choices for you, so you're mostly hitting A in combat, great for multi-tasking.\r\n\r\nWhen, and if I give this game more time, I may change this review.", "timestamp_created": 1736706414, "timestamp_updated": 1736706414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185457080": {"recommendationid": "185457080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869830778", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2085, "playtime_at_review": 1997, "last_played": 1737338304}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "um jogo muito criticado, mas tbm mt subestimado\r\nprimeiro ff q joguei qnd crian\u00e7a e vim re jogar agr em 2024 e 2025, e to gostando mt\r\nele tem seus pontos negativos comparado a outros ff mas n dxa de ser um bom jogo", "timestamp_created": 1736705011, "timestamp_updated": 1736705011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524211585521697998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185441715": {"recommendationid": "185441715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870415710", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1034, "last_played": 1726378050}, "language": "english", "review": "Square Enix will fall like their partner Sweet baby\nalso if you release product in the west we have all rights to criticise you", "timestamp_created": 1736692327, "timestamp_updated": 1736692327, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.318012088537216187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185407051": {"recommendationid": "185407051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072852055", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2696, "deck_playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1683599531}, "language": "english", "review": "Great characters, terrible game.", "timestamp_created": 1736653617, "timestamp_updated": 1736653617, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185398658": {"recommendationid": "185398658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065906827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 947, "playtime_at_review": 3436, "last_played": 1737404225}, "language": "german", "review": "Top", "timestamp_created": 1736644060, "timestamp_updated": 1736644060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185392972": {"recommendationid": "185392972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348852601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1728915657}, "language": "english", "review": "It doesn't have English Dubbed.", "timestamp_created": 1736637964, "timestamp_updated": 1736637964, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427927911281585693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185392012": {"recommendationid": "185392012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357983228", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2685, "playtime_at_review": 1799, "last_played": 1737327826}, "language": "latam", "review": "Entiendo que a muchos no les guste este juego, pero a m\u00ed me trae muchos recuerdos.

Not to detract from the very strong themes and story-beats, and very pretty visuals, which still look extremely good.\n\nI can understand disliking the linear nature of the game, especially if you're a FF fan, but I think it makes sense. Given that the cast is made up of people that are on the run while also being on a strict time limit because of their Focus, they don't have much time to deviate from their goal. Whether or not you think this justifies the linearity likely differs per person, but I thought it was quite interesting, actually. And in spite of this, I don't think that's enough to call this game bad, in my opinion, as there's still a lot of other positive aspects.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learnt from my recent replay, it's that I remain a XIII defender.\n\nAlso Vanille x Fang is one of the greatest love stories in the Final Fantasy franchise", "timestamp_created": 1736631780, "timestamp_updated": 1736776009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588830232620239258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185380586": {"recommendationid": "185380586", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172943778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 897, "playtime_at_review": 2208, "last_played": 1736626905}, "language": "english", "review": "A game with peak story, world, characters but very boring combat (hope it improves with later games in the trilogy)", "timestamp_created": 1736627128, "timestamp_updated": 1736627128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185376265": {"recommendationid": "185376265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873213088", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1734776873}, "language": "english", "review": "If playing it for just one playthrough?

This game has its ups and downs for sure, and it is not the best Final Fantasy title, but I have a special place in my heart for this game and it is surely my favorite Final Fantasy series (FFXIII/Fabula Nova Crystallis).\n\nAfter becoming much older and being able to actually absorb games and understand them, I am enticed with this game it has a crazy mythology with a story that can become like static at times, but as a whole it is a game that I highly enjoy. Lightning is a character that I have always loved and seeing her before Lightning Returns is amazing due to how much character growth she has. Snow has the coolest Eidolon design imo, Twin Shivas that turn into a motorcycle is sick asf. I'll always defend this game series and I really hope that it gets remastered someday all three games in one.\n\nI am not gonna draw this out though, so I will end it with this: you either really love this game or you really hate it, there's no in between. I really love it lol. I love the characters, I love the lore with gods and the L'Cie (especially since it still tied with the whole crystal mythos theme of Final Fantasy). I do agree that this isn't the strongest game by itself story-wise, but if you are going to play this game you might as well play the others to finish the story. \n\nThank you Nomura for the amazing character designs as always and Toriyama for creating the expansive world of FFXIII, it will forever go down as my favorite game title(s) of all time.\n\nUntil we meet again!\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b2\u2846\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u2847\u2800\u28a0\u287a\u2809\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e0\u2816\u288b\u287f\u2809\u2889\u287f\u28a5\u2840\u2860\u28f4\u2806\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u287c\u2801\u2880\u285e\u2801\u2880\u285e\u2801\u28a0\u283f\u284a\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2814\u2812\u2824\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u285c\u2880\u28e0\u285e\u2800\u2880\u285e\u2800\u28a0\u280f\u2800\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u280e\u28e0\u2816\u2826\u28c4\u2849\u28a2\u285c\u2800\u28b8\u287f\u2807\u28a0\u281f\u2800\u28e0\u280f\u2800\u2870\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u2803\u2874\u2803\u2878\u2822\u2884\u28c9\u285f\u2800\u28a0\u280f\u2800\u28a0\u280f\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2870\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2831\u289c\u28c1\u281c\u2801\u2800\u2880\u280e\u2800\u28e0\u280f\u28e0\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u28f0\u2803\u2800\u2870\u2801\u2800\u2880\u2874\u2892\u28e4\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u280f\u2800\u28f0\u280f\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u287c\u2801\u2800\u287c\u2833\u2884\u28e0\u280e\u2880\u280e\u28a0\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u280f\u2800\u28f0\u2803\u2800\u28f0\u2803\u2880\u287c\u2801\u2800\u287e\u2849\u2813\u2824\u28c0\u28e0\u280b\u2860\u2803\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u284f\u2800\u28f4\u2803\u2800\u28f0\u2803\u2880\u287e\u2801\u2880\u285c\u2800\u2808\u2811\u2824\u28c0\u28c0\u2874\u2801\u2800\n\u28f0\u283a\u288d\u2851\u2824\u28c0\u2800\u28e0\u28ab\u28a7\u28f4\u2803\u2800\u287c\u2801\u2880\u285e\u2800\u2880\u280e\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u28af\u2873\u28a6\u28c8\u2811\u2826\u28c9\u28e1\u280b\u28f0\u28b3\u28c4\u287c\u2801\u28a0\u281f\u2880\u28e0\u282a\u2884\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2808\u2812\u282c\u28d3\u2826\u28c4\u28c0\u287c\u28a1\u280e\u2800\u2809\u2810\u283b\u28da\u282b\u28cc\u2819\u2836\u28cd\u28a2\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2822\u2825\u2814\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2846\u28f1\u2800\u28fc\u28b0\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u280e\u2874\u2801\u287c\u28e1\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u284e\u285c\u2881\u287c\u2871\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u283b\u2884\u28de\u283c\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "timestamp_created": 1736597457, "timestamp_updated": 1736597925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185333680": {"recommendationid": "185333680", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228213388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 420, "playtime_at_review": 1201, "last_played": 1736703244}, "language": "english", "review": "I really do like this game, I don't understand the hate.", "timestamp_created": 1736587259, "timestamp_updated": 1736587259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185331452": {"recommendationid": "185331452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198428259477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 455, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1736645248}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi!

I have played a lot of the other final fantasy titles, but this is the first one I have played on Steam. There are good sides as well as bad sides to this game. In my opinion it was really good, but I can definitely see why some would not like it.\r\n\r\nThe main problem that most people have with this game is that is too linear, and I do agree with this. It is very different from a lot of other final fantasy games. It is not an open world game and you just do what the game tells you to do. There are no side quests or decisions you can make; it is mostly running on a straight path and fight the next group of adversaries. This may cause a lot of people to not like this game, but I didn't mind it much.\r\n\r\nOne thing that may get annoying is the fact that a lot of the fights are basically the same. Sometimes the game gives you hallways full of groups of opponents that you have to fight to move on. These fights get old after a while because it doesn't matter what attacks you do or anything you do in these fights - it becomes spamming any attack or just using auto-battle finish the fight quickly.\r\n\r\nAside from the last issue, the combat system in Final Fantasy XIII is pretty alright. It is simple: you have something called an ATB gauge that you have to wait for it to fill up in order to choose what your character will do. You can have a different number of moves that are possible depending on how advance your character is. You can use the move slots in the ATB gauge to use items, heal party members, or attack, basically. \r\nOne thing I believe could have been better is if it was just turn-based.  I feel like the combat system could have benefited a lot from this because it is really awkward how the game works between attacks; it can just turn into you attacking an enemy the same time an enemy is attacking you.\r\n\r\nOne thing that makes the combat system stand out is the paradigm shift feature, which you will need for most boss battles. It is a little weird learning how to use it at first (partly because it is introduced already a few hours into the game), but it becomes very helpful later on. This is the feature that makes the game interesting. It allows you to change it to fit your characters and fighting style. You can, and will, change between paradigms in battle. They will suit what each character in your party needs to do at the moment; for example: if your characters just took a lot of hp damage, you can press tab and switch from a paradigm that is more offensive (like having two commandos and one ravager), to a paradigm that is more balanced (like two commandos/ravagers and a medic or a commando/ravager, a sentinel, and a medic) or a paradigm that is more defensive (like a commando/ravager and two medics, a sentinel and two medics, or three medics). One thing that is annoying is that you may need to switch them quickly in some battles, like at the end of chapter 5 or in the fight against Odin. You need to be very precise with when you use which paradigm. You don't know when you will receive a new attack so there is some uncertainty. You can play it safe and switch quickly to a paradigm that has offense and defense, but you also risk not doing enough damage to your opponent's stagger bar. This adds to my criticism that Final Fantasy XIII should be turn-based, or at least pause when shifting between paradigms or using items.\r\n\r\nRelating to the Paradigm Shift, Final Fantasy XIII has a \"level-up\" system called \"Crystarium.\" The Crystarium system is also easy to maneuver to suit your fighting style. You level up specific roles your characters can play in different paradigms. You start off with three roles per character, like Commando, Ravager, and Sentinel for Lightning, but about halfway into the game you can upgrade any role for any character in the Crystarium, as well as customize your party members (with a limit of three). Depending on how much you have played, you can upgrade different qualities like health, strength, and magic with Crystarium points.\r\n\r\nMy last remark about the combat system is that you only control the actions of one character, and the entire party will lose if your character dies. I wish it was different because then you wouldn't have to switch to a defensive paradigm and lose progress on stagger bars.\r\n\r\nGoing on to the story of Final Fantasy XIII, I thought it was decent. The main premise is that there is a land called Cocoon, and people from Cocoon fear outsiders called l'Cie who have magic powers. l'Cie are given a vision called a focus that will lead them to complete a mission. The main character, Lightning Farron, was a soldier of Cocoon, but resigned after her sister, Serah, became a l'Cie. Trying to help her sister, Lightning becomes a l'Cie as well, and joins with other people who have also become l'Cie (Snow, Hope, Sazh, Vanille, and Fang) to complete their focus.\r\nThere are beings named Fal'Cie who give the l'Cie their focus. The fal'Cie are supernatural beings. To not give out spoilers, I will not say much more about the fal'Cie to not give out spoilers, but there are great plot twists at the end. \r\nOne comment about the story is that they sometimes throw a lot of information at you, especially at the beginning, and it may be hard to follow for some. You jump right into the story with all the information given to you in the dialogue. If you aren't paying enough attention, you may miss out on some details of the main conflict.\r\nAnother thing is the pacing. I really liked the pacing on some parts and hated it on others. There were sometimes contrasts between these, like when you go from Chapter 7 to Chapter 8. Chapter 7 was an amazing part of the game; it was fast-paced but still good, it was epic, there were awesome fights, and a lot of things happened that made it great, but right after that, the story switches to two other characters (Sazh and Vanille) at a Chocobo Park. Events important to the overall story were still happening, but it felt out of place. And it was the same with the contrast between Chapters 6 and 7, and Chapters 8 and 9. They all switched the pacing too much.\r\nI guess you do need to change up the pace a little, but it felt way too drastic at times. It also may have contributed that in the more action-full chapters you are playing with characters like Lightning, Snow, and Fang, while in the chapters that felt slower you would play as Sazh and Vanille, who aren't as good to use in a  fight.\r\nThat was it for the story.\r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy XIII looks amazing for a game that was originally released for the PS3 and Xbox 360. The cutscenes almost look like  they were made for a PS5 game, but the actual gameplay looks alright. It definitely looks better than some Final Fantasy titles released years after (like Final Fantasy Type-0 two years later). One thing that was weird is that, from the beginning, there was a small stutter approximately every second. It doesn't stop whether you are in a cutscene or in a battle, but you can get used to it after a while. After an about hour of gameplay I ignored it - it doesn't really affect anything.\r\n\r\nThese were my thoughts on Final Fantasy XIII. I think it was a great game. I would definitely play it again (and I most likely will).

I have always loved JRPGs (mostly star ocean and Tales of series) but I don't really know why I never tried Final fantasy games, even though it has been the most popular entry to the genre in the west for years.\r\n\r\nObviously I remember how FFXIII was critisized at its release : at the time, open world games were extremely popular and the linearity of FFXIII was controversial. I decided to grab it recently to actually try it and meet this franchise. I was definitely not expecting much from a controversial 15 years old game, but I thought its linear gameplay could actually be relaxing to \"try\" it and wouldn't bother me too much.\r\n\r\nThen I started it and after 2 hours, I thought \"Damn, It's not too bad actually, I like the atmosphere and I'm curious about the lore\".\r\n\r\n25 hours in, I was getting hooked by the combat. I don't really know why, but there is something well designed about it, its pace, the animations, the simplicity was pleasant but at the same time it was really fun to try different strategies and think about some build ideas. At the same time, I actually loved the linear progression in the story, it was so refreshing after all those years with lazy open world games, filled with tedious tasks... The story, and mostly its characters started to be deeper, more interesting and I definitely wanted to understand the world more.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later, I get further into the game, when it opens up, witnessing a great part of the world, filled with huge mobs. There, I started playing for the fun of testing build strategies and combat as this moment into the game allows this kind of freedom, nearly telling you \"go ahead, now play\". At that point I was having so much fun that I wondered \"What if I tried to actually platinum this game? I love it so much what the hell\". For the context, I am definitely not an achievement hunter and actually try to \"100%\" games extremely rarely. But this time I was enjoying every part of the game so much, I wanted to achieve a lot here.\r\n\r\nAnd here I am, afetr a bit more of 100h of playtime, the game 100% completed with a huge smile on my face. What a journey that was... It is so rare, but I actually loved everything about this game, the story, the ending, the combat, the progression, the world building, the challenges. It was the kind of experiecne every gamer dreams to have with his games, the one which is really special, that leaves a mark in your brain, the one you want to tell everybody about, the one you want to find again. \r\n\r\nOkay...

It shares some similarities with Final Fantasy X (FFX), as both games are linear and use a similar character progression system.\nWhat FFXIII does well is the characters, which are all more fleshed out and realistic than in FFX, as each one has individual motivations, struggles, and flaws. Some characters are quite grumpy and not as heroic as in previous games, especially in the beginning, which can make them less likeable. There are arguments and bounding moments within the group, which is a nice change from previous games. The overall tone is mostly serious and humour is rarely found. There is also a little of Persona in FFXIII, as each character has their moment to overcome. Speaking of Persona: you can try to ambush enemies by sneaking up behind them in non-combat mode. There are no random encounters! :-)\nThe combat system is okay. You define roles for your characters and can switch between predefined sets during combat. The characters fight on their own (auto-battle), which can feel very passive, and especially at the beginning of the game you have no options other than pressing auto-battle. The combat system opens up more, but some battles can feel very tedious and make you wish there was a fast-forward button.Fortunately, cutscenes can be skipped if you need to replay a major battle. The camera movement during combat is too much - it adds dynamism but at the expense of overview. As with all previous Final Fantasy games, you will have to grind to level up your characters later in the game, as the difficulty increases considerably at the end of the game. There are a lot of different enemies, but I would have liked to see more variety in enemy behaviour rather than their stats that would require different strategies to defeat them.\nThe equipment upgrade system is good. It is not well explained in the game, so I recommend reading a guide. If you are willing to grind for materials, you can spend several hours in this system. You can also do various optional side missions in the game, which offer very hard fights.\nThe story is good and told in many cutscences (except for Chapter 10). There is some vocabulary to learn, but you can (and should) read all new datalog entries and then you will be able to follow the story, which can be a bit confusing due to the many back and forth and objectives shifts, but the overall world building is interesting and unique. The main villain is portrayed in a clich\u00e9d way who has at least a clear goal. \nI really like the graphical designs of all characters, enemies, and Cocoon city. If you install the FF13Fix and HD mod, the graphics still hold up pretty well, except for the empty environments. The voice acting and music is good, but most music pieces are less memorable than in previous games.\nThe two main problems with FFXIII are the objectives and the environments. You travel through a lot of corridors, most of which feel empty, artificial, clinical, and dead. This is a big difference from FFX. In FFXIII are no villages, temples (puzzles), Blitzball (mini game), or NPCs to discover, which makes the game feel repetitive and dull after a while: walk, fight, walk, fight, cutscene, walk, fight... The other problem, although it is part of the story: you never really know what the protagonists are trying to achieve, it's mostly like wandering around and seeing what happens, which is not the most motivating objective. \nAll in all, FFXIII offers an interesting journey and world, but one that can be tedious to explore.", "timestamp_created": 1736083777, "timestamp_updated": 1736209089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184822819": {"recommendationid": "184822819", "author": {"steamid": "76561199166253597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3061, "last_played": 1735719925}, "language": "english", "review": "Most players don't like this game but to me, this is one of my favorite Final Fantasy game I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1736072191, "timestamp_updated": 1736072191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184811054": {"recommendationid": "184811054", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057736720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1651, "playtime_at_review": 6464, "last_played": 1736485023}, "language": "english", "review": "Played with the FF13Fix Mod\r\n\r\nPlaying this in primarily 2024 having not played it when it originally released, I was fairly happy as a fan of the FF series. Strong soundtrack, and very enjoyable combat and upgrade system, once the game lets you get into it properly. The game consists of forced party composition and fairly limited access to resources for character upgrades until the mid-late game, but was overall fun even in the early sections while learning the ropes and doing the mixed point of view early story. The endgame was very fun, but it is lacking in some of the quality of life features that would make it really excellent (teleport system is pretty limited for a game where the hunts are a large part of the enjoyable side content and require lots of map traversal, little problems with the UI, etc). My other primary gameplay complaint is lack of enemy diversity in the endgame, you end up doing a lot of similar encounters, though the interesting quirks of the combat help keep it interesting.\r\n\r\nThe game does have some issues with the story, it being one of the FF games where the scale of the story gets more crazy the longer you go, and an initial wall of understanding the games setting. I recommend keeping up with the data log entries to keep track of what's going on, and even then motivations can be weak and pacing awkward. \r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed playing it as a game, and could tolerate the story with a little bit of eyerolling and some of the more likeable characters.", "timestamp_created": 1736058938, "timestamp_updated": 1736058938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184802067": {"recommendationid": "184802067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409535214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1907, "last_played": 1736049169}, "language": "english", "review": "amei a hist\u00f3ria, trilha sonora perfeita, lightning protagonista perfeita e maravilhosa games", "timestamp_created": 1736049246, "timestamp_updated": 1736049246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184785823": {"recommendationid": "184785823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798065052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6556, "last_played": 1736039823}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1736033393, "timestamp_updated": 1736033393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "184785718": {"recommendationid": "184785718", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002415754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "playtime_at_review": 2402, "last_played": 1736426588}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La historia es muy buena, lo mejor son los personajes como Light, Snow, Fang o Vanilla.

The story is wild because the game does a horrible job at explaining it. You start the game as if it's picking up from the ending of another game. A lot of terms are being thrown around that the game doesn't explain. \n\nThe combat isn't that good imo I absolutely hate the paradigm/deck building concept. The hybrid turn based, wait for your meter to fill is outdated garbage. FF XVI and Remake have the best combat systems to date. \n\nThis game is very hard. In fact, I would argue it's one of the most difficult FF games made. The battles can be so incredibly punishing and the difficulty pushes many away. Some of these fights can last 20+ minutes and to die to some bs broke mechanic is infuriating. I don't care how many \"claim\" the game is easy statistics don't lie. The steam achievements don't prove all the pros in the forums that claim this game is \"too ez\". FF XVI, Remake and it's DLC, and FF XV were all just right when it came to difficulty. There were even harder modes if you wanted it. If this game were a new release the devs would 100% adjust and patch some of the unfair, garbage mechanics in this game.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome, especially the ending scene.

The player would have benefited from having a north point on the HUD compass, and the expandable map not moving. It would also be great to know where each exit on the map leads too, so the player doesn't need to look up a guide. I know the game wasn't made with Oerba in mind, but they threw a massive open map with unclear navigation. I've been told that all of these issues are fixed in the subsequent games, so I'm looking forward to playing them. Being able to flee combat would be nice too. New game+ would have been nice, considering you can't unlock the 10th tier of the Crystarium without beating the final boss.\n\nMy biggest gripe: if the player character dies in combat, it's over. You can immediately retry the battle with all of your items restored, but it's so BS.\n\nAll that aside, my pros...\nI like the cast. The combat is fun. Being able to switch out every member of the party is great for strategy.

I recently upgraded to a laptop with a 4060 and I was having the same issues I was having before, so I knew it wasnt an issue on my end. I did some research and it turns out the games were not properly ported to PC. I may never get to finish this game because it has not been optimized whatsoever for PC. This is a real shame, seeing how square is by no means a small company and having 2-3 people fix the issues with the current game shouldn't cost them too much. I just want to enjoy this adventure again and finish this game, but until Square Enix fixes this game, i'm afraid that likely wont happen. Yes, there are mods to help with the stutters and crashing but realistically I shouldn't have to do that for a game i bought with my own hard earned cash.

Lo que m\u00e1s me encanta de este t\u00edtulo es su est\u00e9tica y dise\u00f1o de personajes. Aunque la historia es incre\u00edble, personalmente me inclino m\u00e1s por lo visual. Ahora que lo juego 10 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, me doy cuenta de que est\u00e1 fuertemente influenciado por movimientos como el Frutiger Aero y est\u00e9ticas frescas que combinan lo futurista con lo naturista, tendencias muy de moda en aquella \u00e9poca, lo que lo convierte en un referente ic\u00f3nico de su tiempo.\r\n\r\nEl viaje de Lightning y su equipo est\u00e1 lleno de momentos inspiradores y memorables. La manera en que los personajes se desarrollan a lo largo de la historia est\u00e1 muy bien lograda, manteni\u00e9ndote alerta y conectado con la trama. La primera vez que lo juegas, los giros argumentales realmente te toman por sorpresa, pero al jugarlo de nuevo, te das cuenta de que las pistas siempre estuvieron ah\u00ed, y que cada escena e interacci\u00f3n aporta algo importante a la historia.\r\n\r\nEl sistema de combate es incre\u00edblemente fluido.
