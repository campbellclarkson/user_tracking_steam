Gaming is a primarly visual medium, and if developers want to succeed, they must understand that it's not an area for compromise.  You deserve better than compromises.\n\nYou're forced to sign a highly questionable yet legally unenforceable End User License Agreement... for such a relatively low effort, low quality product, this comes across more as a delusion of grandeur than anything else.  This agreement includes questionable requirements that may attempt to revoke consumer law protections that gamers expect to have, which is also highly problematic.  Developers must learn they are here to serve gamers, not control them.  I had my cat walk over the keyboard while the EULA was displaying, which fixed that problem for me.\n\nOn pricing and value for gamers, this isn't really free as the game is infested with mobile app store like P2W monetization, including a whopping SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS worth of P2W DLC.  This is a consumer hostile model that we don't need to see on PC.
