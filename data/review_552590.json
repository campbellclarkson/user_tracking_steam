It takes around 10 hours to complete.  It never felt like it overstayed its welcome and it was enjoyable until the end.\n\nYou play as Lafacdio Boone, a preacher who has received an invitation to a Masked Ball along with several others from their friend the Marquis in his Mansion.  The gameplay centers around navigating different areas of the mansion during a 12 hour time loop and finding a way to prevent the other guests from being murdered by the staff of the mansion.  This is done by finding different clues, using powers you obtain from the masks and using items that you find.  You are also able to manipulate time in 4 hour intervals forward or do a complete reset of the day back to noon.  \n\nThe two areas where this game shines is the overall atmosphere of the mansion and the plot of the story once you get near the end.  Discovering different floors and rooms of the mansion stayed engaging for me because they all had a different feel and they looked cool.  Once you beat the game some may want to go back and get all of the collectibles and it doesn't feel monotonous because of the new areas you discover, different scenes with the guests that you may encounter and unlocking the collectibles gives you more background and lore on the mansion.   I can't say much on the ending without spoilers but I'll just say it was quite a twist and it was a clever story.  The music was quality as well and really helped make the scene in some parts of the game or make a different area feel more unique. \n\nThe animation on opening doors can feel a little clunky at times but that is a very minor problem.  I had no crashes or bugs.  Also, the game minimizes and opens back up very fluidly which is nice.\n\n\nThe Sexy Brutale is good but I wouldn't say it is amazing.  It is worth playing if you have it.   If you don't own it I'd probably try to get it cheaper than $20 when you can.   It is relaxing and keeps you interested while having a memorable ending.", "timestamp_created": 1737243361, "timestamp_updated": 1737244172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555618166923522949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185432824": {"recommendationid": "185432824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138317097", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1736684038}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Five hours made me feel more than any 80 hour game", "timestamp_created": 1736683997, "timestamp_updated": 1736683997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "185324801": {"recommendationid": "185324801", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123241803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 832, "playtime_at_review": 872, "last_played": 1736571638}, "language": "english", "review": "As a point and click game with a focus on timing puzzles, this delivered a fun experience.
